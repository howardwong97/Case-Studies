it is so much better than the one it replaced and quiet|Positive
"So far I think it is a good purchase. I haven't used it too much yet, but I think it will help in cooling down the small hangar I rent. It takes a few hours for the ""new"" smell to stabilize, and reading the directions I realized that I am not running it on the fan only position for 30 minutes after use, but that's kind of inconvenient!"|Positive
It doesn't match on advertise, it just work as a fan, a expensive fan.|Negative
Works like a charm.|Positive
This grill cover was perfect and easy to snap on|Positive
Best bang for your buck. Just unpack install casters fill with water and ready to cool you down. Would recommend this to anyone. Really moves cool air around keeps you nice and cool in hot summer days.|Positive
Only used the cooler for a couple of weeks, but it's still working without issues. It's pretty quiet and puts out a lot of air. The only concern is there is no way to tell if your manually overfilling the water. Should be some way to indicate the max. Greg|Positive

"I've only had this product a short time and so far all is great with it. The fan alone cooled my living area right down during a recent very hot day. I have used evaporative coolers before with a lot of success so I""m hoping that this one provides the relief I need from what should be a very hot summer for a reasonable price."|Positive
This cooler is a great product. One does have to remember that it isn’t an AC, the temperature of the air is dictated by the temperature of the water you’re running through it. Obviously, if you keep it in the shade and run cold water, you’ll have the equivalent of an AC. The power louvers are a great feature. Instead of a “one lane draft” that cools/humidifies one side of the room while depending on separate fans or air exchange to catch up to the other half, the louvers help considerably to widen air flow path. The water tank is a good capacity for the size of the unit. The casters make it easier to move with a full water tank. A 600 sq ft capacity isn’t bad at all for the size of the unit. I would suggest multiple smaller units such as this one, for individual work areas, against one of the larger units that can cost upwards of $2000. I would suggest this cooler for anyone with a shop that they use in sections. For example, an 80’x50’ shop is 4,000 sq ft. If you use half of the shop for parking a boat & camper or toys, but only use the other half, 2,000 sq ft, for projects you can easily use 3 of these to place in different spots for just over $1,000, versus a larger port-a-cool that would cost twice that. Overall, a great product for home or work, for a good price.|Positive
Love It !|Positive
It leaked water on my wood floor!|Negative
Made in China, first one did not work. Second one worked as it should. Will see how it lasts.|Positive
Made the room hot. Not worth it!! Just get a normal fan, or spend the money on a portable AC.|Negative
Happy with this product, especially for the price. I live in a small house and it does what I need. The only assembly was to put the wheels on. Yay. I recommended this product to friend and she bought one also.|Positive
This has been great in my garage while working on cars or other projects. Also recently used on patio while grilling in the Arizona heat. Great value|Positive
Evaporate cooler works great for my 24x36 workshop. Goes through 2.5 gallons of water per hour. I'm happy with it and would recommend to others.|Positive
Simple, sale and efficient. Highly recommend over other such as the Honeywell. It’s doesn’t have any frills like remote, auto swing, or timer.|Positive
It filled my needs|Positive
I do not recommend this product! It does not cool as the description states and it leaked water all over my new carpet. Two thumbs down!|Negative
This unit I bought about 4 years ago, at season end fortunately. If your house is 1400 sq ft, dont buy this unit, go with the larger champion 5000. My airflow is average, use a 1/2 hp motor, but have paint flaking off, rust appearing on inside of pan, rust up the inside post of this. Still working but might try and find a larger unit or different manufacture. I clean this unit at the end of each season but the inside is not good. Highly reccommend keeping the bearings oiled. I mean about every 30 days or less, my temp went up to 77 in the house, oiled bearings and was back down to average of 75.|Negative
These covers are made of good , tough material well sewn and well made.they should last several winters.|Positive
The summer high temperatures and low humidity have not yet come. I think it will work just fine. I will tell you at the end of August !|Positive
These pads stink like nobody's business! There is a gut-wrenching chemical smell that drove me and my entire family out of the house instantly. I'm talking AWFUL smell. We thought MAYBE it'd take a few hours to air out but it was just as bad later on. HORRIBLE PRODUCT. (FYI: We've used many other brands & types of pads with no problems, only this one smells like a chemical factory dumpsite.)|Negative
Several surface dents; Plastic directional vanes required reinstalling; fan assembly not seated correctly with 1 screw not tightened; fan blades bent out of round and wobbled excessively. Fixed all but dents. Shouldn't need to fix a new item but with delivery problems didn’t want to try returning.|Negative
I thought this would be a good match for us. When set up and working , it only lowered our room temperature by 2 degrees if any. Really felt like an over sized and overpriced fan. We took it back and bought an air conditioner.|Negative
This unit works well in my space to cool it down and add humidity which is nice with our dry climate. It is however pretty noisy even on low speed. Overall it seems to be a good value.|Positive
Bought a house last summer. Had a old Sears Kenmore cooler on the roof. Live in Nevada. Couldn't use it between 12 and 7. All it did was blow hot air. installed this two weeks ago. It's been high 90's all week. On low cool the house is 70. Love it.|Positive
This float valve was just one of several replacement parts that I purchased for this year's anticipated maintenance in order to switch over to my evaporative cooler for this season, of course on the hottest day of the year and on a weekend, the only time I have to do such projects. Of everything that I had to replace, this was the absolute easiest. All of the washers that I needed were right on it in the order that they should go back onto it and the entire replacement did not take but 2 to 3 minutes, including removing the old one that should have been replaced last year. This new valve is a lot simpler than the old one and was a lot easier to get tightened to the wall of my cooler with 2 small crescent wrenches because of the thickness of the inside nut that was a fixed part of the valve. I have very hard well water and I am 27 miles from the nearest local hardware store and 52 miles from the Home Depot where I got this, so I will purchase another one of these to put in my cooler parts box to have on hand.|Positive
I've only used it a few times so take that into consideration. I'm using osmotic-filtered water in it so I'm filling it manually. The water gauge is set to be used with a hose, I'm thinking, so it shows less than full capacity. It ran out of water a few times before I found this out, but still works (thank goodness.) It seems to put out some cold air so am happy with it when it's running with water. It does a good job in my garage. (Wish it was American-made but it was the right size and price.)|Positive
I am very disappointed! Setting this cooler inches in front of you will not help any. I wish i would have returned it when I had the chance but, I didnt try it out soon enough :(|Negative
I purchased this product for a relative to help her deal with the extreme heat. When it arrived i set it up for her, and got it running. She noticed that the sleep feature did not work. I contacted home depot, they advised me i could bring it in and be credited to purchase a new one. Luma comfort was not so cooperative, the offered plenty of excuses on why the device did not function properly, good thing i dealt with home depot on this, because the Manufacturer has a lot to learn about customer service. We received a new one, and it works great. Thanks to Home Depot.|Negative
Great price, fast shipping, super easy to install.|Positive
The cooler pads for the MasterCool evap is sooooo overpriced, I sold the Master Cool window evaporative cooler & bought a window AC unit. Don't have to worry about paying almost $100 including tax & shipping, to replace the sour smelling pads AGAIN!!|Negative
Easy to install, does not handle power surges well.|Positive
This evaporative cooler has basically changed my life! My husband and I have tried everything to cool down our apartment in the summer and nothing's been working until now. We live in Phoenix, so it gets incredibly hot and super dry. When we turn on our evaporative cooler and let it work all day, when we come home it feels so amazing and has cooled down significantly. I highly recommend this to anyone who has suffered from summer heat!|Positive
I have owned 3 other units similar in size but this one is one of the best, they really thought of everything. Works great!|Positive
I choose this cooler for our place in VT where we only have window units. Our Ceiling fan died here in Fl and I thought why not try it? It made a significant difference in how cool the room was. Like other people mentioned, this will not replace an a/c unit. It will cool your room down significantly and pleasantly. Surprisingly, it didn't make the room overly humid. Since we live on the water I thought that it would. We've run it with and without the water tank filled which is basically like a fan. I like the remote control and the timer feature is brilliant. The water tank stays filled about 7 hours so using the timer feature is a smart way to not run the cooling unit without water. The ice packs are handy but I liked adding ice chucks to the water to get extra cooling. It's quiet to operate and the directional fan setting is great. It's easy to wheel around by the handles on the sides. One more feature I liked was the air filter is easy to remove and clean, it just pops off of the back of the unit.|Positive
Surprisingly impractical side lacing that left me scratching my head. I don't understand why this design didn't use SIDE VELCRO to secure the cover rather than the odd plastic buckles that leave multiple inches of gap up and down the corner of closure.|Negative
Cooler works good, easy setup and very quiet. Used to replace similar one.|Positive
Is cooling enough|Negative
Easy to install in swamp cooler. Works like new now.|Positive
This product overall deserves 5 stars. It is by far the best portable cooler you could imagine. However,,,, it came without a screen filter. it shows one, even has instructions on how to clean it in the instruction book, but didn't have one. When we contacted the company (which by the way, Home Depot was super helpful in arranging for us), that said in China, they decided to leave that part off. Okay,,,,well then they should take the picture and instructions of the filter off. Anyway, here in Phoenix, you need a screen filter on anything that moves air so we just built one ourselves and solved the problem. Love the cooler and would buy another if needed even knowing what we do about the filter. Yeah, it's that good.|Positive
I've been working with evaporative coolers on my 20+ rental properties for over 9 yrs now. The thickness of the metal on this one is considerably thinner than others I have worked with. One bolt that holds the motor bracket assembly snapped in two while I was trying to tighten it. I'm switching to Plastic Evaporative coolers, eliminating the belts that constantly break and fighting with rust. To me, this unit will not last very long given how thin the metal is and how easily bolts are snapping even before it's put through the harsh conditions it will go through.|Negative
Bought wrong size, but cut it down and made it work|Positive
I've had it about 4 days now, so far its okay, its no A/C but I'm sure we are all purchasing this because the majority don't have A/C for whatever reason. Think swamp cooler cold. Its not so bad and so far works great.|Positive
Fitted the unit on to our machine and it immediately worked perfect. And seems to keep on doing the same.|Positive
This motor was exactly what I was looking for. All the motors in stores at this size were 2 speed, while my house wiring would support only one speed. Old motor I replaced turned out to be 2 speed and running on low. This one is putting out much better airflow. Plus better bearings means it will last a lot longer. Very happy with this purchase!|Positive
It Fits Perfectly and keeps the cold air out , am very happy with this product|Positive
Excellent unit. works beautifully.|Positive
exceptional cooler, works great. However it came dented in two places. Credit was given without hassle . Am very satisfied with entire purchase.|Positive
Upgraded from smaller units and these move considerably more air. Very convenient to have everything already include (motor, pump, pads). Installed though the wall so had to enlarge the existing holes to accommodate the larger vent/control panel, which I expected.|Positive
This item is what it says it is. It's built well and should keep us cool. The problem is however...the opening that attaches to the roof's opening does not match up. On ordering this item, no choice is made for different sizes on the bottom of the unit. The cooler is the same brand and size as what we have that has worn out after 14 years. So buyer beware of this problem. So, we have it on our roof but have not been able to attach it yet. We are constructing an adapter so it will fit properly. We've loved the old one up until it started to rust out. If it had fit or give us size options on the downward draft fitting, we would give this high marks. Just be careful.|Negative
It is a great product and holds well. The only bad thing is that air goes through it ......and it can cold in the room...but, I guess it needs to be breathable or you get mold.....|Positive
"The old valve was rusted and leaked like a sieve. After a bit of WD40 and two vise grips the old float valve was removed. That took about 8 minutes including the 5 minutes to let the WD-40 soak in. Installed the new brass valve in less then a minute or two I was back in my office enjoying the cool air. After 10 minutes I went out to check if the overflow was pouring out water like it was before and it was completely dry. Thanks Home Depot for another great DIY product. BTW, this unit was serviced, ""by a pro"" that the association hired last year. My water billed sky rocketed because he only changed the float and not the valve. Guess if you want it done right you gotta do it yourself."|Positive
Sometimes looks almost like an AC, i want to try with an ice bag on the water, blow a lot of air, is not too much noisy cons, the ventilation material and clip holders of the filter are a little weak, need to be careful i use it in Miami, FL and even with this weather works great|Positive
Wow can't believe you would sell this with 1/8 inch female fitting when 99% of connections male to female 1/4 inch from the swamp cooler?? Why not all 1/4 inch ?? Well now in order to make this fit you spend xtra money for more fittings. Just not right and you must want your customers too spend more money|Negative
Well made unit, wide range of controls, looks nice…..but misses the mark on primary function as it does not really blow out any cool air. Does improve humidity but will not help to cool room.|Negative
Motor seems to be working fine. The true test will be to see how it holds up over the long run. It would have been nice to have the options of the new cord and mounts.|Positive
Doesn’t cool @ all. I was better buying@ AC unit instead. Not a very good purchase on my behalf.AJV|Negative
It's quiet, so we put it in our bed room. So far so good.|Positive
Seems to be good quality. Loose fit, but says it will shrink. We'll see. Yellow color stands out on the roof. Should make them of brown canvas to blend in with most roofs.|Positive
I thought it was more like a regular cooler,but instead it is all plastic,and is not going to last long. Not a good purchase for the price.|Negative
The unit puts out a good volume of air, better than I expected and there is a few degrees of cooling effect within that breeze. I also have a portable a/c that puts out a colder, but much less volume of air and by using the two in conjunction under a covered patio, you can survive those 100 degree days in comfort.|Positive
Tie down straps that look like they might work. I think the part that locks the straps so they do not move is not as effective as they could be. I was able to pull them apart with just hand strength. Still, they appear like they will last for a while. I think the straps could be wider and the part that bites down could be more robust. Usually you have another metal part to weave the straps into but this just has one. I plan on using them to strap in parts in my daughter's pickup bed to hold things in place while she travels. I will make a square knot tie as the final guarantee that they do not come loose. There ya go!|Negative
Easy to fit while indoors, squeezing the cushion sides through vent opening after removing vent louvers.|Positive
We love our new cooler! It does exactly what it says it will do and it is very quiet. The only thing that I am not thrilled about is that there is not an auto shut off for the water pump that would allow the fan to keep running and the water pump to shut off to prevent burn out. I have to set the timer to shut the unit off in the middle of the night to keep it from running out of water.|Positive
Product was excellent fit, help protect my home uses of all season long.|Positive
goodproduct|Positive
cover could use reinforced holes on bottom to attach ropes to for more protection against wind. but good fit|Positive
It fits well and was mostly easy to put on. I would like to have more cords and instructions on how to install. I thought the material would be heavier but it seems to be enough . I have had it about a month and still looks like new.|Positive
everything I expected.|Positive
This 1 HP was a good fit for my Master Cool 6500 cfm. Easy install and running smooth.|Positive
The unit i purchased is defective. Spoke with a company rep this morning - have to swap the unit for a new one.|Negative
This cooler was easy to set up. It works great. It is quieter than expected.|Positive
This is an excellent pump! The evaporative cooler has been used pretty much non-stop all summer. The pump is quiet, and effective. Highly recommend!|Positive
excellent fit and finish for my swamp coller|Positive
i live here in AZ with temps in the 100 degree +. electric went up last year by 40% so this unit will save me a ton of money in the dry months. really great construction with all the adjustments any one would need. the remote control saves me on walking up and down stairs to turn unit on and off.|Positive
I live in an extremely dry environment and this has been the best way to cool down for our whole (only 900 sq ft 2 story) town home.|Positive
Pretty much an expensive fan. In fact a window fan is better than this because it does circulate the fresh outside air as opposed to this big box that requires a refill of water at least once per day yet it feels no different on cool mode than it does in fan mode.|Negative
Works very well. Purchased for use in garage. Easy to use, cools very good in hot temps|Positive
What a difference. Just set it to your comfort level and forget it.|Positive
The float valve is an exact replacement and works fine.|Positive
Too large but have not yet used the Evap. The fan is OK but noisy.|Negative
The new one works fine.|Positive
it fit|Positive
the price of this pump is reasonable and very easy to insall|Positive
Superior quality compared to less pricey cooler floats. I looked at all three different models and ease of adjustment and workmanship.|Positive
Huge upgrade from my old 6 switch. Once it's set up it's very intuitive and will save me from several cold mornings after having to leave the swamp cooler on all night. Converting the 6 switch was a little more involved then some of the other reviews made it seem. Of what used to be a junction box connecting the power supply, swamp cooler, and old thermostat, I had to install the control panel (included) in a very tight attic and run a 18-3 thermostat wire to where my old thermostat was. As a DIYer, I had no issues with the product, all the issues I had installing were due to the faults of my very old house. So double check you have access to the junction box and will be able to run a new thermostat wire where you need it to be.|Positive
I put a thermometer directly on the air vent of the cooler. In a two hour period it lowered the temperature of the air coming out of the cooler by 2 degrees. I checked the pad on the back and it was wet with water running down it as required but no cool air. It worked as an expensive fan but it did not cool. I am in Phoenix and the humidity is in the single digits. It should cool great but doesn't. A lot of hassle to repack it and haul it back to the store for a refund.|Negative
I have a 3500 square foot retail space with high ceilings. Our AC is broken. While this unit definitely isn't big enough to cool the whole space, it has definitely helped take the edge off.|Positive
Way too expensive for just a bunch of cardboard. A $118.00 seriously!. I never would have bought this $800 cooler if I would have known I would have had to spend a hundred and twenty every year to change the filters. Like I said $118 worth of cardboard. Companies like this don't deserve to exist. Even $50 would have been too much but okay... You got me.|Negative
It is a beautiful tower. It does the job as described but it does not cool down the entire room. The instruction of how to open the water compartment is wrong. No clear instruction of which side to insert the battery to the remote control. It was really hard to insert, the battery kept popping out. It is a bad design. The water compartment can be pulled out but can not be removed off the main unit. However, it has a hole to release water, and the entire unit is light, so it is easy to carry the entire unit to the sink to clean. I wish the heigh of the wheels can be adjust a little to slightly tilt the tower up so the air can flow to a more higher space to cover my entire body when I am sitting.|Positive
Works so well!|Positive
This portable evaporative cooler is wonderful. It works better than I expected. I have never even had to use it on anything but low. I am in a basement, but the temperatures have been 90 to 100 degrees lately. I would buy it again.|Positive
Easy to install,unit runs smoothly now, no problems during installation|Positive
Simple install, really nothing to it. Works fine for small to medium size coolers. I'm using it on a Bonaire Durango. Since there's really only one full size pad, and two mini pads, this unit fits the need easily.|Positive
The product is great|Positive
This cooler works great. I've had it installed for about two months now with no problems, absolutely no leaks, and very good operation. The only negative comments I have are: the sheet metal is somewhat flimsy, so you have to be careful when you remove the inspection panels not to bend them; a couple of sheet metal screws were over-tightened at the factory and the threads were stripped as a result; the filter media added a mild but odd odor to the air for the first week or so of operation. I would abolutely buy this cooler again and I would recommend it to a friend. Strangely, it was much cheaper to buy the bare unit and purchase the motor, pulley, and purge pump separately rather than buying a complete assembled unit.|Positive
"Great product. Adequate cooling for an evaporative cooler. The only issue I had was the manufacturer should have installed a standard sized garden hose fitting for the hose hookup instead of supplying an ""adapter"" to modify my garden hose in order to get it to work with the fitting installed on the cooler, thus the hose can't be used for anything else."|Negative
Working good|Positive
The air conditioner arrived at the store very soon after ordered. The condition of the packaging and the unit were great----absolutely no damage at all!|Positive
I love my new air portable evaporative cooler!! I have been wanting one of these for awhile because living in the California Desert can get pretty miserable in the summer! .This unit is way more affordable than using central air and uses 75% less energy plus keeps my house just as cool as central ac. I also love that it is eco-friendly, all natural and needs no harmful chemicals to operate. This unit is incredibly powerful and quickly cools an area of 250 sqft. We just roll it into whatever room we need it, plug it in and it instantly cools the entire room. I'm also impressed with how quiet this unit is and you barely even notice it is on. Amazingly it requires about the same amount of electricity as needed for a 100-watt light bulb so this is going to save us hundreds in electric bills this summer. These coolers work best in low humidity climates so we are fortunate to live in an area we can use this and have the opportunity to save on electricity with this. The only month the humidity is high here is in August but all the other months this unit works perfectly. I also like that it has three fan speeds and two operation modes so I can easily choose my cooling options according to the weather. .The unit even comes with an optional ice pack container to make the air even cooler if needed. I haven't needed the ice container yet because the unit alone has been keeping our rooms pretty cool as it is so far. We would definitely recommend this new air portable evaporative cooler to anyone who lives in low humidity climates and wants to save hundreds in electric bills over the summer months.|Positive
"This works. It actually will blow in cooler air then the room temperature but it is not an AC unit nor should it be looked at as a ""portable swamp cooler."" It is ok for sleeping in a hot room and having it blow directly on you. You will cool a bit, but everyone else in the room will still be warm. For the price point of this product it isn't really that great a value. You are better off getting a window AC unit. Cheaper, will give you enough cooling power to cool a room rather than a person. If you have horizontal sliding windows check out youtube for ways to jury rig your window AC unit to work with those windows."|Negative
Awesome I bought 2coolers my experience was great all the way from shopping online to delivery to my house. Great overall experience that is why I shop Home Depot online|Positive
Product is exactly as described and made of quality materials that should last numerous Winters!|Positive
Air is not as cool as we hoped it to be.|Negative
Highly recommend works great|Positive
I used this cooler in my greenhouse orchid room. It is a replacement for the same Champion unit that was eleven years old. It does the trick and works for me by not taking the humidity out of the room while it cools. Home Depot was a great way to purchase it. It was cost effective and easy.|Positive
Everything worked as expected. We sre finally cool!|Positive
No the pump has already gone out in it shortly after I got it|Negative
Good as a fan but it does not cool at all. Definitely not for Florida.|Negative
Heavy material and well constructed. Highly recommend.|Positive
Works like it should|Positive
I got this product to help with hard water deposits on my new swamp cooler. Very easy to install and now only time will tell if it works. But, I have noticed that I don't have the same mineral buildup occurring that I used to get. So maybe it's working!|Positive
These filters are becoming more and more difficult to find. I was pleased to find them at Home Depot, because I have two stores near me and they are easy to deal with. The filters installed and work as they are designed. Handle them with care as they are a bit fragile until installed then they just do their job, clean and cool our very dirty outside air. Free shipping was a bonus as the box is very LARGE but lightweight. With our water I can only get about 4 years out of a set, then they must be replaced. All in all a good experience with Home Depot and the product.|Positive
Even with the ice packs in the water it blew borderline hot air out the front. If you want just an expensive fan, it will work out for you. I will be returning it.|Negative
I purchased this evaporative cooler and it's worked really well all things considered. I live in SoCal and occasionally the humidity gets too high for it to work as more than a big fan, but in dry climate and when the humidity is low, this baby screams. I can easily and efficiently drop the temp in my house more than 10 degrees. I would caution that if avg humidity is over 30% in your area, do not get this. It will not meet your expectation at all. But if you're in a dry climate, looking for something more earth friendly and wallet friendly on your bills, it's an excellent unit.|Positive
The original pump stopped after three year - so had to replace with a new pump. This new pump is OEM - just the same as the one that came with the cooler.|Negative
it lasted one day|Negative
This is the product the manufacturer recommends to keep the hard water deposits dissolved and the portacool operating at maximum performance. Supplied one from factory matched.|Positive
NICE WELL MADE EVAPORATOR COOLER/CENTRAL AIR COVER- It helps keep the dirt, leaves,etc. out of the motor. Put it on a couple weeks ago,since the temp. here has finally cooled down and it should work well for the winter. The heavy duty fabric it is made from says: it is 200% stronger and 80% more water resistant than cotton canvas. It has 2 nice double netted vents for good cross ventilation too. Comes with an adjustable cord to keep it snug and secure,although we did add an extra strap around the middle due to the high winds we get in our area. So far so good! Stayed on in the last recent wind storm!! Good value for such a heavy duty cover. I believe it will last for quite awhile!|Positive
Met all my expectations.|Positive
"I bought this as my 20 yr old cooler finally rusted out. This is the same physical size as the old one. It is a ""window"" cooler but installed thru the wall as a permanent installation. This cooler works great! It doesn't quite have the air flow of the old one but the outlet grill is a little smaller too. The grill provides very nice adjustability with 3 separate movible grills to direct air flow to the right, left, up or down. This unit is quieter to. My old unit had the black goopy sealer on the bottom of the water reservoir to protect against rust. The new one has a 10 year rust proof warranty against leaking with a very nice durable powder coated (I think) on the whole cabinet... very nice! I was going to install a coat of the black goop but they specifically tell you not to as their coating is too slick and the black coating can come of and plug up the other components and void the warranty... so no goop. This cooler is very nice, good quality, and works really well."|Positive
This unit although beautiful in design does not measure up to its potential. I was pleasantly surprised by the size and ease of setup right out of the box. However that was short lived once I plugged it in. How should I put this. HMMMM my 90 year old grandmother could blow hard than this unit does, not to mention the only thing that it could cool would be a room that's like a 6 X 8 cell.|Negative
GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE. A VERY QUIET RUNNING EVAPORATIVE COOLER.|Positive
Met expectations|Positive
Cools well in our werehouse even on medium.|Positive
Works like a dream!|Positive
Great equipment|Positive
The cooler doesn't cool off my bedroom, I am very disappointed and if it were easy for me to return this I would. The temperature in the room remains the same whether or not the unit is on, the only thing that works and helps some is to have it blowing directly on me for air movement. This had such good reviews from others that I am not sure if I got a BAD unit or ????|Negative
Great Swamp cooler, use it daily. If you live in a low humidity area, these types of coolers are indispensable. I use it on my back patio to help cool off in the afternoons while relaxing after work. It is plastic, but seems durable enough for what it is. This puppy can use allot of water. The fan is very powerful and pushes the air well. I keep a hose attached to mine outside, so I do not have to worry about filling the water tank. Yes, it has a float gage which is highly visible from the front of the unit. So far I am very pleased with the unit.|Positive
Installed float and 2 months later evaporator was overflowing. I adjusted the stem farther. Still flowing. I raised the stem with my hand to make sure it was in the complete off position and the water still leaked. The leak was a flow not a drip even with the stem pulled all the way up. I'm buying the bronze valve float. It's $14 instead of $5, but the extra 9 bucks is worth it for me not to have to get up on the roof again.|Negative
It did not come with clips but it was easy to install|Positive
Perfect|Positive
"THE TREATMENT PRODUCT IS EASY TO USE. SINCE IT WAS PUT IN MY 36"" PORTABLE COOLER, THE WATER IS BEING ABSORBED INTO THE COOLER PADS BETTER AND THIS HAS MADE THE COOLER UNIT PERFORM MUCH BETTER."|Positive
eorked like a charm|Positive
This evaporative cooler does the job. Easy to use and fill, easy to move. Makes a little noise but it's more of an ambiant noise. Have had the first one for over a year and haven't had any problems.|Positive
Despite following all instructions and living in an arid location, the swamp cooler did not work. It just spewed water all over the floor and then just acted like a glorious fan. Ended up taking it back.|Negative
The smell is the only bad thing|Positive
Living in San jose with no AC was getting out of hand, but once we got our units we put ine in the front of the apartment and one in the back and it made summer so much easier.|Positive
Pain in the behind to change but good quality.|Positive
This is the second one I have bought. Replacement for the first one that is almost 20yrs old now. Long life due to maintenance evey year, replacing pads every other yr. Oil pillow bearning evey other month, and motor. New one come's without motor, but have existing one that is only 2 yrs old. Not sure if new come's with pump? But also have existing pump that is only 1 yrs old. Side Draft for easy service. Their 1/10th the coast of regular air condition. Just the thing for So. Calif: For the price, it cant be beat.|Positive
The belt works yea!|Positive
Three improvements needed: 1. handles on the sides for easy removal and replacement of the front 2. Louvers that move vertically and horizontally 3. filter to remove desert dust. Bonding with the unit would be easier if installation pics and instructions were clear and step-by-step.|Negative
Works great, made of good material. I was worried it may come off with the high winds in my area, but hasn't budged with all the wind so far.|Positive
the product lives up to its reviews. a little noisy on high but fans make noise. goes through about 1 gal. of water an hour.|Positive
"First off, it's well made, using quality metal and parts. With the exception of the padding, which is straw, and I just replaced it with the blue synthetic type, so not so much of a big deal. The unit has a direct drive fan, that puts out too much air for the small single pad, and on high speed it's just too much air flow for it to cool right. The fan is just too much, sometimes less cubic ft. per minute is better, and this is one of those time. The fan is very loud. The water reservoir is very small, so if you turn it on when it's already hot, the water will be hot. So you have to go outside first, and splash the water out to get some cool water in it, before you turn it on. No there is no drain plug on this unit. The vents aren't much good as it comes from the factory. The face is almost entirely open, so I had to cut some card board to fit the inside of the face, so the two round vents would actually work as intended, otherwise the air just mainly blows straight out. I'm using this on a 30' travel trailer which is 240 square ft. It does not cool the entire trailer. The swamp cooler should be rated more like ""cools 100 square ft"" instead of 400 square ft. Still it beats nothing when the temp is around 95 or so outside. For what you get, it's highly over priced, this unit should sell for around 200. The two design flaws are the main reason. Too small of a water reservoir and the turbofan out of a small jet engine... I should add that the little stand of legs it comes with will only work well, it your walls are about 6-8 inches thick. The little pipes that support it against the wall are just too short. I had to take them out, and reposition them to stick straight out. They use two single hole electrical conduit straps to hold them in place, and the pipes just slide in them, so I wrapped tape around the pipes to make them stay where I clamped them down. It's a nice little concept, just has two design flaws, that seriously hinder it's ability to work correctly."|Negative
I was using a digital one but after 4 years it went out on me.I thought it was my swamp cooler and it took me all summer to figure it out.But once I changed the switch it has not given me any trouble.|Negative
It's a great air conditioner and puts out a good quality amount of air|Positive
This product is replacing one that is has lasted 30 plus years and appears to be made from the same mold with a 5500/6500 CFM rating.. Home depot should make it a store item as it is rated for homes up to 1800 Sq feet. Most homes in this area are this large and larger. More care should be taken during the factory assimbly stage as there were several striped out sheet metal screws.|Positive
Good airflow. Helps take a few degrees off the summer heat. I put a box fan blowing out on the other side of the room and that seems to help keep the humidity down. Has a little bit of a smell, but it has lessened over time.|Positive
Easier to install than the original pads and cost less. What's not to like!|Positive
The unit does not cool as advertised. Also, after two weeks one of the ice packs is leaking a green substance.|Negative
Arrived fast complete only had to install wheels works prefect great for inside garage just need to leave door open|Positive
First off, if you don't understand swamp coolers already then this isn't the product for you. I've used them for years, and even I had to tweak things a bit (things that should have been in the manual but weren't). I'll skip basic swamp cooler knowledge and go straight into this model - you have to REALLY tune the drip rate and direction of the water via the control knob AND the little output pipe. You want the filter media to be damp, but not soaked. At the maximum flow setting there is WAY too much water being fed - I don't even think in front of a window with 110 degree temps could make use of that much flow. Ideally you'd have a small corner of the media actually dry - the thinner the layer of water the better the evaporation. Again, having the media SOAKED is not ideal (for ANY swamp cooler). With this model I've found that you almost have to have the flow control knob all the way OFF to get proper evaporation (although I haven't tested the thing beyond 85 degree temps yet). Another mild annoyance is this means the pump is recirculating the water a lot, and it drips audibly back into the tank. I think I'm actually starting to like that sound though, kind of reminds me of camping next to a small creek. Bottom line: This product isn't the most user friendly thing right out of the gate, and the manual should have included a section along the lines of my comments here. After spending a day with it though I'm very happy. Final thought: MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO CLUE how to properly use a swamp cooler in the first place, and without that knowledge I could definitely see people being very disappointed in this product.|Positive
Easy to install. Perfect fit. Felt the cold air stop immediately. Thank you!!!|Positive
First set lasted only 3 months, then began to fall apart. I hope these last longer|Negative
Awesome to buy. I enjoy buying Bonaire Durango. Very efficient and worth it to buy it.|Positive
I had to return the first one I purchased because it leaked water. My wife was fit to be tied as they say. However I liked the concept of the product, the features it has especially for the price, and decided to give it another try. I returned it to Home Depot and told them it leaks but I would still like to try one more. No problem they said. Refunded my money, then ordered me another one right then in the store. This one works just fine. I like the fact I can add ice into the water tank or, on the top of the machine there is also an ice compartment. Good size too. Just lift off the lid and add your ice. Very happy with the second one. I would have given it 5 stars had I not been given that bad one at first. Same with my quality rating. Can't give it a perfect score when I had to exchange a bad one. The picture shows the compartment and lid on the top of the machine where you can add your ice.|Positive
It is a great tool|Positive
I installed it but it is so flimsy that I do not think that it will last long. We will see.|Negative
Good Cooler. Some parts were bent a little. The frames would not go back in the cooler without some adjustments, It does cool well.|Negative
The cool air this puts out is great. I have it in my living room ( which is small). Initially it has a horrible odor when you run it for the first couple times so I thought something was wrong, but the product brochure indicated this is normal. What I don't like is that the water access area to fill it is extremely small which makes it very difficult to fill and I end up pouring the water all over my carpet in the process of filling it. Once full you can run it about 3 hours before needing to fill it again so definitely not a unit to leave on while you are away from home.|Negative
Horrible, couldn't cool you off if you were standing right in front of it, let alone an attire room. I returned it.|Negative
Nice unit. Instructions were not clear and lacking important info. Once I had the unit mounted in the window I needed to remove the back cover a couple of extra times. Once because the float valve was not tightened and then again because the drain tube seal had been installed on the wrong side. All this right out of the box. I would recommend buying the purge pump. I plan to get one within the week. So, I will be taking the back cover off once again, but at least I now know how to do it and it's not that difficult. I don't like it dumping water continuously like it does now when I run the unit. I would have gladly paid a little more had the unit already been fitted with a purge pump. Hopefully this will be the end of $200 a month electric bills during the summer months when I use to have to run the AC.|Positive
It does the job but it's very noisy on low. I've tried replacing the brand new bearings and tighting the fan assembly and can't get the rattling to go away. Unfortunately high is only good at night when background nose is easier to deal with.|Negative
Does not last more than 1 season, needs to be more heavy duty and better quality|Negative
"Had to replace a Champion 4800 CFM cooler for a mobile home and this was a direct fit. Ordered online and truck delivered in about 5 business days - delivered to driveway on a shipping pallet pre-assembled. Unit comes with everything you need including float, drain discharge kit, motor clamps, motor belt, wiring, and pulley, just not the motor itself so save your old motor or order a new one with the unit. Removal of the old, rusted cooler took longer than installing the new unit. I chose to disassemble the new unit and bring to the roof in pieces and worked great. Installation was easy and only took minimal fuss to set float level and and ensure drain and water inlet were tight and leak free. Cooler operates whisper quiet with 1/2 HP motor but does have ""new smell"" until the pads rinse out. Changed water after an hour or so of use and smell was all but gone."|Positive
For those who didn't experience enough cooling, assuming that you are in a dry climate where evap coolers work best: If you haven't used aspen pads in your unit, I highly recommend that you install them. I live in Albuquerque where summer days are often in the high 90s. The old Champion window unit wouldn't cool below 84 degrees until I switched to aspen pads, which cooled to the low 70s. Astounding difference! Blue pads are pretty much useless, IMO. I also found a plug-in programmable thermostat at Home Depot which worked great.|Positive
Excellent product. I would pay more for the straps. They are a must for windy areas.|Positive
It was a good fit.|Positive
This pump does overtime where I live. Summers can reach near 100 degrees and stay there for weeks. This pump is a work horse!! Always ready to keep us cool whenever I flip the switch.|Positive
It’s a nice cooler. It doesn’t cool like an air cnditioner, but you do feel the difference in temperature in a room. I would recommend it for small spaces. It does what it advertises.|Negative
Installation was perfect from previous unit. Works well.|Positive
I purchased this unit after buying the 5300 CFM cooler, which I was completely satisfied with. I bought this smaller unit for a carport where I work on cars. Very disappointed with this one. The air flow is really, really low and the resulting cooling is low as well, I returned it the same day. Buy the 3100 CFM unit - you will be much happier.|Negative
Broke in one year. The brass rod broke where it attaches to the valve, leaving the valve full on, causing an overflow and collateral damage. Also, even before the float stem broke, water flows out from float attachment slot as well as the outflow tube--that's not good.. The same type valve broke a year ago. Too cheaply built. I'd gladly pay twice the price for a sturdier, better-built, more reliable valve. I replaced this one with a more expensive one from HD, but the valve itself looks identical.|Negative
Side by side comparison with a Portacool cyclone 3000 the Coolspace is better made. SS fasteners , variable speed motor and a larger auto shut off water pump the Cool Space Glacier 18 is a better value. Both drop air temps by 20 degrees ( 100 to 80)|Positive
Got the cooler from Home Depot in June 2011 and pads just rotted out. Bought replacement from Home Depot just about two weeks ago and the installation was quite easy and the pads fitted very well just like the original. I do recommend this product a hundred percent.|Positive
I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Ultracool 700 CFM evaporative cooler. Only two improvements to product I would like to see in future models. Like others who reviewed the unit, I think the water level indicator is pretty worthless. It did give a general level indication originally, but then got stuck in full position. Also door where you pour in water is a real fingernail breaker. Otherwise I'm really pleased with the performance.|Positive
I previously ordered a custom cover that was much more expensive. It tore this fall and I needed another on short notice. I wish this were a different color (grey would be nice) but this is constructed of very heavy material and seems well sewn. I am guessing it will outlast 4 or 5 of the more expensive version. Very good product for the money and Home Depot got it here very quickly.|Positive
I live in Denver, I know how evaporative coolers work (many of my friends have them), and that they aren't as cold as air conditioners. But this didn't cool my bedroom at all. Instead, it became hot and humid, rather than merely hot. Fortunately, Home Depot accepted my return with no hassle at all.|Negative
Recieved two of these for Christmas and was pleasantly surprised that something like this was even available. I spent good money on helmets for myself and my wife because we really enjoy riding the backroads and enjoying the scenery. Storage during the winter months was just a little cloth bag that came with the helmet. Not anymore!!! Now I have a great storage option that truely provides protection and ease of storage. Exterior is a nice heavy denier nylon type material with a soft fleece type material that touches the helmet. The two things I really like are the carry handle on top of the bag and the rubberized material used on the bottom of the bag which helps keep the bag where you put it. No sliding off the shelf, or seat, or what ever you sit the bag on. Size was great, because I have a wireless communicator system on our helmets that mount on the outside of the helmet and the bag was plenty large enough to accomodate that transmitter. Over all very very pleased!|Positive
Good product, was easy to install|Positive
Right on|Positive
Media seems like it was sitting on shelf for quit some time. Falling apart while trying to handle it during install.|Positive
Very easy to install and wire. Instructions were great|Positive
The fan on the product stopped working the first day we used it.|Negative
Noisy for trying to sleep. Several different sounds are produced at the same time while it runs.|Negative
super complete in all areas|Positive
It's the middle of the range float with the plus of the more expensive version: brass. Why I like this one is functional. The more expensive brass float is heavy duty and can only be adjusted by loosening a Phillips screw and adjusting and tightening that screw after lowering or raising the rod with the float. I like the simple method of just bending the rod and this one is bendable unlike the almost double the price heavy duty one.|Positive
This cooler cools my 1200 sq. foot house in 90+ weather and makes it fairly comfortable. It doesn't take up much room outside the window and works very well.|Positive
Good quality canvas cover. Fit as measured. We will see how it holds up over the winter. Arrived on schedule and as described. Again Home Depot prices match or beat other online competitors.|Positive
Exactly what I was looking for, my only issue was the add listing did not tell you the size of the pads. They turned out to be just what I was looking for now I have six (6) years of filters.|Positive
Works great keeps room just right worth the price I recommend it|Positive
Bought this a few weeks ago and have already used it through a couple of hot days. Large water capacity, though light and portable when not filled for moving to use indoors or out. Very pleased with purchase.|Positive
I have purchased three of these evaporation coolers. The first one the electrical components were defective, so it was returned. The second one, the lower location where the screws holds the two major components together seriously leaks water. Again, it was returned. The third one had the same exact flaw as the second one, so I called the company 800 number. As it turns out, this is a common problem. The screws the company supplies to hold the parts together, perforates the baffle that holds the water allowing the water to leak through the screws. An obvious design flaw or to say a designed in flaw. They suggested that I purchase J.B. Weld's Water Weld and take the screws out, inject the putty into the screw holes and re-drill the holes after it has dried for an hour. Buyer Beware!|Negative
This is great product which is portable and light-weight. I love the design and the cooling system as it spreads the cool air evenly. I am using this one for my bed room. I loved it so much that I am planning to buy another one for the guest room, before the summer kicks in in LA. The vibrant red color add a dash of elegance to the cooler.|Positive
I needed two different cooler cover sizes. One I could find in the stores (went to 3) and the other I could only find on line. After buying on line I doubt that I will hunt in the stores for anything in the future. The on line buying experence was so easy, and having the items shipped to my closest store at no cost is great. You get a text or email when the item is ready for pickup. No more wasted time hunting through the store, doesn't get any better than this!!|Positive
We purchased 3 of these coolers. I have over 25 yrs in the HVAC trade. The coolers are average, nothing outstanding about them. One of the coolers blower is slightly out of balance, but due to the location of the installation I will not take it down for warranty on the vibration. My biggest negative comment would be the electrical connections. There is not enough space in the interior plug receptacle to make the connections. The best solution is to mount a junction box on the exterior cabinet where the wires come through. This location is not suitable for a flush mounted j-box so a nipple should be used to protect the wires from the cabinet to the j-box. The coolers do the job as expected, but evaporative cooler operation is simple, if you have water on the pads, a working blower, low humidity, and proper air exchange for the space, you have cooling.|Negative
If you're looking for a small air conditioning unit, this is not what you want. Even with the water and the ice (recommended in one review) it didn't work. It's great as a fan if that's what you want. but don't waste your money thinking it's an air conditioning system to cool the air.|Negative
want we need for our homre|Positive
Fit my lawn more perfectly|Positive
This pump definitely pumps a lot of water. The outlet nozzle is a bit larger than a standard evaporative cooler pump, so it took a little work to get the hose on it.|Positive
We got two of these for our home, one sits in our bedroom and the other in our living room. It does a great job of keeping our bedroom nice and cool (cool, not cold) and it's nice to be able to set the timer for when we fall asleep. The unit in our living room doesn't keep the whole room as chill as I'd like, but to be fair, it has a vaulted ceiling and connects to our kitchen... so it's quite a bit more than 500sq feet. It definitely has helped keep us cool while were on the couch or in the kitchen (since we can simply turn it around and have it face wherever we are). Quality wise, don't expect the greatest craftsmanship or durability. We've returned a couple of units already because they either began leaking, or they arrived with broken pieces (via UPS). I will say this though, Home Depot, by far, has been the easiest to deal with in regard to exchanges and returns. A quick explanation of what was going on with the unit and they've sent us on our way each time with a new unit without any hassle. Overall, I would say I'm quite satisfied with the unit. It does what it says it will do and is pretty energy efficient, our energy bill didn't go up much and we run it every day for several hours. For the price, I just wish the quality was a bit better.|Positive
This cooler is amazing!! Easy to install and very quiet when running. It cools effectively even on low setting and is incredibly cold on high...just what we want!!|Positive
works very well in a dry climate. we only used the A/C 5 times this entire season. the Master Cool system was used almost 95% of the summer. We had 100-105 temps for most of the summer. It worked so well that I had to turn the temp up sometimes - cooled the home too well. Our Electric bill was only 99/month.|Positive
Unit works very well and easy to assemble cools very well too.|Positive
Didn’t really cool the room off like I expected. Just made it super humid|Negative
Returned. Decided to buy a new unit instead|Positive
Allow me to start by saying that this little cooler is a great value. We bought it for use in our shop which is approximately 800 sq/ft. It does keep the temperature around the low 80's if we start it up before it gets too hot outside. We are located outside Phoenix and the daily temperature averages (this summer) somewhere around 112 degrees. With that said, if we don't turn on the cooler(s) and shop fans prior to it getting above 95 degrees INSIDE the shop, the shop temperature will not drop below the 90's until the sun sets. Even with all that, it definitely makes a HUGE difference. We have decided that for next summer we are going to add another Hessaire cooler, but we'll buy the 5300 cfm version and use both simultaneously. Between the two coolers they should be able to handle these brutal AZ summers and make our shop a comfortable place to work. We are sold on the Hessaire brand and will definitely buy more as needed.|Positive
"I am happy that I decided to spend the extra $ for this model vs the old style ""Aspen Pad"" coolers."|Positive
Your Home Depot website did not include all of the pertinent information necessary about this product. This product works well as a fan but not as a cooling system. It was not stated on the Home Depot website that this product works best in areas with low humidity. I bought this product to cool during our most humid days and found out by reading the instruction book that was enclosed with the item that which I just stated - that it works best in areas of low humidity - probably like somewhere in Arizona. Therefore, I am returning the product as soon as I can print my receipt.|Negative
they had the same model / power rating in other colors for more $$. i added a T to dump a small amount of water down the bathroom vent so it will reduce the calcuim buildup.. i'm very peased so far..|Positive
116° {downtown Phoenix} by the numbers @5:30 PM : 108° on the shaded South porch Hessaire Model# MC37M swamp cooler sits upon that concrete slab porch blowing its evaporative air thru an open door into my uninsulated 3 car garage ~720 sqft. Exhaust air is the top of the open door. Garage is 91°. If I turn it on early, when garage is ~85, I can keep temp 87-88° until 10pm when I retire and turn it off. That 17° drop is about as much as I have ever seen on evaporative coolers. I don't know how long the cooler will last, but in years past the garage gets 120°+ and eats car batteries, and anything else heat sensitive. We have had a week of 110°+ days often 108° as late as 8pm on the porch. 93° was my worst reading when I delayed turning it on until 4pm. Placement of thermometer is ~ 15 feet from Hessaire @40 inches above the floor. I have used a box window fan to push cool air further into third bay and that drops the temp another degree and a half. If I had a high vent on far side of garage perhaps it would push out more hot than I get with just an open door. Life is bearable? If you sit within 4 meters of Hessaire grill. Noise: 3 speed fan, HIGH is as noisy as the box fan on HIGH. LOW is quiet if you can sit within maybe 8 foot of unit. Just crank up the TV, stereo, radio. Usable time per tank of water: I am getting ± 3 hours once I turn the hose off. I like the oscillation feature. It is behind the safety grill, and spreads cool air over a wider area. Heat wave has eased, and evening temps are ~90° on porch but 83° in garage. Either the humidity is rising now, or garage roof and walls continue to radiate daytime temps into the garage. I do not recommend MC37M because the hose bibb connector/ adapter is a leaking piece of junk. The access to water tank is a plastic threaded nipple extending from left side. I guess it is metric, because they included a copper fitting: one side to plastic threads, the other side fits a US garden hose. it connects like this: <=->, i.e. straight. The hose side leaks badly if not tightened with pliers, which makes for stress on plastic threaded part, and a tedious ans often wet procedure every time you wish to move unit. If the brass adapter was 'L' shaped i.e. Γ, I think it would work much better for me. I can not risk breaking the plastic threaded nipple.|Negative
The original pads gave the full width and height with 2 pads. these pads require using extra pads to raise the height to the required 40 inches. These extra pads aren't facing the correct way to allow airflow through them. I don't believe they will be as efficient as the originals.|Negative
Very pleased with the looks, the performance and the price. It sits on our covered patio which we use daily to watch tv, birds and animals in the back of the yard. We have a ceiling fan above us as well and find with lots of ice we are comfortable at 100 degrees. Saturday will be a really good test as it is supposed to hi 115 degrees.|Positive
Worked to cool my daughter's dorm room. They are not allowed AC in their old building in Boston.|Positive
Really did not do that good of a job with cooling - even after I put some small blocks of ice with the water - perhaps I should have applied the cost of this machine to a floor A/C -|Negative
No complaints about this little pump so far. Been working great for about a month.|Positive
Work great got me out of a bind as I used it on A.C. at office at work the only problem was the system on building was 220 and motor was 110 volts but I made it work everybody is happy|Positive
does not get cool does not have a good oscilation and is loud|Negative
it really helps to keep my working area more comfortable|Positive
the installation was EZ, Did it my self.............|Positive
I like these pads... they are the exact size i needed so no measuring an cutting like i had to do with those acrylic fiber cut to size pads... i think these are just as good as those fiber pads at a fraction of the cost.... so why pay more.....|Positive
Worked well|Positive
The right size and thickness for the cooler I needed it for. I wish it had grommet holes in it thought. Could have saved some rope.|Positive
Effectively cools 12x16 room when used in dry climate. When used with closed system HVAC as adjunct, takes room temp down -2 degrees from A/C set temp. Easy to maintain and clean. Perfect for dry climate like Arizona.|Positive
Very happy with the powerful motor definitely buy it again|Positive
This pile of junk only throws air and doesn't cool down the room. I do not recommend this product unless you would like to move hot air from one side of the room to another. It's been a horrible summer and I though that buying a $500 air cooler would cool me down. Instead it let me down. Instructions were to put ice and cold water inside which did nothing. I am very unhappy with this product.|Negative
We purchased the portable cooler and are satisfied with this product. When we picked up the cooler and transported it back to the shop the pump did not work. Being that it is a hard wired pump we called and asked for a replacement pump. Home Depot answer: You have to purchase another unit and get credited for the first cooler. Long story to be said. Very unhappy on the hoops we had to go thru. Also the credits that are put on our credit card. Lots of paperwork and running back miles away from the store we purchased unit from. Maybe Home Depot could help others out that purchase products on-line or in the store little bit better feedback and some knowlegde of problems that could occur when buying items.|Positive
BUYER BEWARE!! This product is deceptive in its simplicity and quality; it's not well made and very expensive to maintain over time. It worked great the first year or so, but EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE UNIT BREAKS. CONTINUALLY. In three years, I replaced every major and minor moving part. In five years, I replaced everything twice (except the motor, which I replaced once). The warranty is meaningless; nothing is covered and Home Depot will not help you get it fixed. Parts are not available at local hardware stores --even the filters (at $100+ a pop) -- have to be ordered from California. This unit is like a very old car. If you can't fix it yourself, DON'T BUY IT.|Negative
CAUTION * Installed this unit last spring. It is going to the dump this spring. When getting it ready for use, I noticed the metal was very thin and actually had to be straightened out to set up. The panels did not fit very well even when new. During monthly oiling & servicing, it became increasingly difficult to remove the panels. Lubed, drained and prepared it well to over-winter. As I opened it up last week to prep for the season, I was amazed that the center shaft had completely rusted and flaked into the fan. The bearings were also completely rusted to the shaft. I may be able to reuse the motor, but this thing is headed to the dump. Less than one season of use and an over-winter. The cooler it replaced had been in service for over 10 years.|Negative
I am very happy with the new cooler that I picked this time. It is more efficient then the old type. It seems to cool so much better then the old type. When I was trying to get reviews I also happened to talk to a worker from Home Depot & he had bought the same one last year & told me he was very happy with it too.|Positive
Fit great !|Positive
So happy to find one left in the store, brought it home and it worked great for about 2.5 hrs. Then it beeped low water and the pump went off. The tank was more than half full still! I filled it back up to capacity and tried to turn the pump on and it will not come on just keeps beeping low water and goes to vent. The indicator says it is full the float is in top of water yet the pump will not go back on! I do not want to leave my animals in this hot house tomorrow and have to work so I cannot take it back to the store until late, and this was the only one they had! The price is not cheap either!|Negative
This cooler works great in my garage|Positive
Just what I needed, and at a very reasonable price. Very easy to install, with a nice snug fit using the ties along the bottom edge. Already seeing a savings in my electric winter bills. Should have added these years ago.|Positive
We bought this to cool down the horse stalls during the recent hot weather. It worked beautifully. It was able to drop the temperature in the 1200 square foot barn by more than 25 degrees. It's loud but not obnoxious. Uses a lot of water, but we didn't use the included automatic hose filling attachment because the water coming from the house was too hot. Instead we filled the 15 gallon tank 2-3 times per day with cold water.|Positive
I had to get another pump because the first one broke after only a few days in operation. This inconvenience has taught me to never purchase another home with a swamp cooler. It's affordable for some but the liability to yourself you take every year climbing a ladder to replace pumps and pads isn't worth it. I wish my realtor was forthcoming when I purchased my home arriving from another state because I would have chosen central air instead.|Negative
We ordered this cooler in anticipation of increased heat this summer. As temperatures soared to 109 degrees (normal for us is perhaps100 degrees at worst) we were agonizing that delivery was not scheduled for 5 more days when we were blessed by an early delivery on what was the hottest day thus far. We set it up... ran it all through the hot afternoon .. and it really WORKS! Granted, it is not an air conditioner, but if you follow the instructions you will find it beats the heat pretty darned well. Our Schipperke discovered it almost immediately and planted herself in front of the cooler for a nap. Set on low, it is effectively cooling our 300 square foot living/dining room comfortably. So, the people and dogs in our house give this a 5 star rating for performing as promised.|Positive
We are very impressed with this unit. It did have a horrible smell for a few days, however; that smell has dissipated and now we thoroughly enjoy sitting on our porch, even in this hot Texas heat, since we have this unit to help keep us cool. We highly recommend this unit and feel like it compares to other more expensive units.|Positive
It seems sturdy enough, only time will tell how it holds up to the sun & heat in the AZ desert. Not crazy about the color though, would have preferred tan.|Positive
Just installed today. Direct fit to older 20 year model. Was able to use the existing pulley and wiring. Only reason not to give it a 5 is because it is louder than the original even with the belt correctly tensioned. I had one issue. We use a multibox that has the computer, screen, printer, modem plugged in along with this motor. The old motor worked fine like that for many years. However, with this new motor plugged in it would trip the multibox. So obviously it is pulling a little more energy, creating more heat. To get around this, I plug the motor directly into the wall outlet instead of the multibox. It works fine. But again, it is a little louder than the original. Hopefully in time it gets quieter and not louder. I just noticed as I'am sitting here typing this review, it does seem to be getting quieter.|Positive
Works well, especially inside. Used for an outside event & could hardly tell it was on. Works better with ice.|Positive
Worked for a couple months now it won't work. Everything spins freely and installed correctly, but the motor won't turn on.|Negative
The cooler did not meet my needs...I put it on an enclosed patio (my crafts workshop) hoping it would enable me to work throughout the hot days of a Texas summer. Although it does produce cool air, it does not hold up in the Texas heat/humidity. I gave it 3 stars because it leaks water, a lot of water. I don't know if it is due to the humidity or if there is something wrong with this particular unit, but the floor is very wet and the water tank needs refilled every couple of hours and a hose it the best way to do that (large tank) so I unplug the unit, roll it to the door, bring the hose over to fill it, then reverse the process. I did try hooking the hose to it for constant water flow but there was even more water leaking and the outside door had to be left open a tad for the hose to come through...overall a no go. I would recommend the unit to someone in a dry climate, but am not sure I would recommend it for use on a carpet due to the amount of water coming from the unit (again, it may be only this particular one). I have had it 3 weeks and am returning it to the store today. It's back to the drawing board to make my workshop bearable in the heat.|Negative
To bad they don't carry them in the store|Positive
Replaced two old leaking squeaking coolers. Easy install, only problem I had was room for electrical two speed relay. Old coolers had square corners as opposed to Hessaire stamped top and bottom pan.|Positive
The key to using this unit is to do the following. Put a fan behind the unit if you don't have a window or a door to provide breeeze. Wet the media, get some ice to put on the top to drip down onto the media. Keep the pump switch on top about half. I use it in my garage in Tracy, where it gets over 90 almost every day. It works good for me...|Positive
This is my 2nd summer with this cooler and I have no regrets with this purchase. The 6 gallon tank lasts quite a while on low and cools my 500 sq main level with ease. I do not have ONE complaint.|Positive
Bought this one after wearing out a luma comfort unit. This one works much better. The only pain in the butt is not having a larger area to access the water tank. There is a hole on the side to put water but ice cubes have to be added a few at a time to fit in the hole. Other than that the unit is very well built and pushes plenty of air.|Positive
It's just some bearings. They worked just fine.|Positive
We had trouble finding a cover to fit our swamp cooler. This was the closest size we could find. It it a tad big, but it is very sturdy and durable. I would buy again.|Positive
This portable swamp cooler is a great product at an unbelievable price. Its strong and easy to push or pull around the house. The only drawback might be the loud noise on the highest setting which is 3, but then again the noise is due to the strong powerful fan blade which will cool you and your house down. Easily cool up to 1000 sq ft.|Positive
We needed something to cool our sitting area in our garage here in Mesa, Az so I ordered the NewAir AF1000. It arrived in 3 business days. I was concerned that it wouldn't move enough air to get the job done but was pleased to find low speed in the early AM and 2nd speed later in the day was ample. Works great up to about 95 degrees with low humidity. Holds enough water to last most of the day. I'm not constantly having to add water but keep an eye on the level because there is not a low water pump cut off switch and you could burn the pump up if you let it run dry. Improvements I would like to see: 1) add a low water cut off switch and 2) make the water fill door larger to make adding ice cubes easier tho it's not a real hassle as is. All in all, for less than $150 delivered to my front door I'm pleased with this purchase and recommend this cooler. BTW...replacement parts are available on the NewAir website.|Positive
"Love this ""little guy"". Works well in the area that I have him in, keeps me cool and comfortable. Yes I would recommend this product."|Positive
Nice cooler pump. I like the outlet hose extending upward from the base. This makes it easy to connect the hose to the pump without cutting into the strainer basket.|Positive
Nice filter|Positive

paid more for ones that did not work as well great deal.|Positive
this product is pretty good for a small room in arizona, where the dry heat is a common thing. Also adds some moisture which is good too when the humidity is 7%. Doesn't work instead of ac but helps to cool down in addition to AC. I think it's gonna save some money overall. I bought it for one bedroom where AC is not efficient, works great.|Positive
Bought and used for home project and works well. Realitvly quiet and energy efiecent, used less energy than last one and worked much faster, would recomend to anyone|Positive
This bad boy cools my entire 1850 sq ft house in the HOT Arizona summers, provided the humidity is in single digits. It moves a ton of air and is surprisingly quiet. I ended up adding a purge pump to help prevent hard water issues.|Positive
The unit does provide some cooling in our tv room. So far we are satisfied, no problems thus far.|Positive
i m not happy because the order not enough equipment to install i have to run back and forward to find some thing more but the manufacture doesn't have eigther ....|Negative
"I'm sure this cooler media is good. I have only had mine installed for a couple of days. If you buy this, be aware that you will need to read the note on the instruction sheet about the ""start up"" odor. I'll admit to not reading that first, and regretting it. My cooler was installed by the previous owner of my house, and it is wired to a thermostat, rather than a selector switch. Therefore I do not have a pump only option. When the media first gets wet, the ""start up"" odor smells strongly like urine, and drove my wife and me nuts. Read those instructions before you run the cooler with the blower the first time after installing this media."|Negative
Bought 2 and got a good price. 1 stopped after only a few weeks but the other one is fine. So I'm divided whether i should recommend it.|Negative
After buying two of these I had too take both of them back. The first one quit working after a few days and the second one leaked water all over the floor.|Negative
Quality product at a bargain price.|Positive
Unit is more quiet and will probably will outlast the rest of the cooler.|Positive
This healp to extend the life on my swamp cooler.|Positive

It's installed and working just fine. Very pleased with the product and would recommend it.|Positive
I have 2 mastercool portable coolers that I have had for over 10 years, but decided to buy this one to cool my garage. I have it sitting just outside the side door, crack the garage door open about 3 inches and it works great !!I am in Las Vegas Nevada so yes it’s hot and dry here, perfect for t|Positive
It's perfect! Would wish that it was better insulated...but if it was I'm sure it would cost more.|Positive
My old cooler cover tore when I removed it last spring so I purchased this one. It appears to be a heavier construction.|Positive
Read the reviews before we purchased it. Knew there would be an odor but truly it does go away after a couple of weeks and it is not unpleasant -- not nearly as strong as the aspen pads we used to use in rooftop evaporative coolers. We got it as a back up for our master bedroom in case our Mastercool (rooftop evaporative cooler) ever developed problems (why does that always happen on a week-end?) but we've been using it almost daily in our large TV room which was added on as an afterthought by previous owners and has no cooler ducting. That room is larger than the max. square footage for this model but we've never had to turn it any higher than the lowest setting. If you don't mind filling the water pan (I used a bucket and it only takes 10 minutes max.), this is a really good unit. Price from Home Depot and free shipping were a bonus.|Positive
Smells horrible out of the package but great quality canvas that will last season after season. It reminds me of the Army canvas tents that were donated to the Boy Scout camp I grew up with. Things were 20+ years old yet still doing their job. I expect this will hold up the same way.|Positive
It works great, we bought it for the kids room, but because it rolls we use it around the whole house. Great product. Very easy to use. Very happy|Positive
This swamp cooler is huge! Way bigger than expected! It’s extremely powerful! I got it for my studio, because I’m transferring into a house. Low is sooo cold! It works better than my mother’s installed swamp cooler 900sf for a 2800 house. Best swamp cooler I’ve ever used!|Positive
This cooler for the amps it draws I was expecting a little more|Negative
At first I thought I was buying an air conditioner, but Internet searches deceive. In the end I understood that it only refreshes the air. It's a good equipment, but do not expect cooling like an air conditioner.|Positive
I just received this unit yesterday. this unit is easy to operate and price is great but it does not cool my room. it actually made my room warmer!!! i live in Southern California. today is 9/7/17, a nice clear day. outside temperature is 86f , 45% humidity. i have 2 bedrooms , bm1 130sf which has a small window A/C unit, bm2 is 145sf with no A/C. so i'm testing the cooler in br2. i installed the air filter and added water to half full. both rooms started with temperature 79.7f in the early afternoon. i turned on the cooler in br2 to high speed ,waited 30 min, the temperature actually went up to 80.5f and the room is filled with unpleasant plastic smell. so i waited another 30 min , it was still 80.5f. the first thing i did was to check the water panel. it's wet and water dripping. so i dumped a pitcher of ice into the tank. now i switched to medium speed, but 15 min later , it went up to 81.5f!!! and the temperature stayed at 81.5f . so i took the thermometer to br1 and turn on the A/C unit and 40 min later it dropped down to a comfortable 74.3f. at this moment in br2 , the cooler is still running but it's warm with stuffy air and temperature went up to 83.3f!! conclusion : this thing works just the opposite of a cooler , more like an air warmer. it's like a strong fan but not even because it makes the air humid.|Negative
The NewAir AF-310 Tower Evaporative Cooler arrived just in the nick of time with temperatures into the high 90's! It's quiet, fits in small spaces and makes the house comfortable. It's very portable, so it can be moved from room to room. We are very happy with this product! It's worth it's weight in gold!|Positive
Easy to replace. All required parts included.|Positive
It was a little hot as I waited for my cooler. Sometimes things don't go as planed. I must of got it right after 3 week and received it that following week. I am happy with my cooler. After 30 years dealing with Home Depot I never have said anything bad about the service I received. I'm retired now days keep up the good work . THANK YOU GUYS AND GALS...|Positive
The unit blows enough cool air to cool off the rest of the house. I do admit though it's a little noisy. A person has to refill the tank at least once a day if they don't have the hose hooked up to it.|Positive
It did not take long to install and it operated perfectly. The instructions were very easy to read and with any knowledge of electricity and the way the currents flowed, it was very easy to install. I would recommend this item in a heart beat.|Positive
Works amazingly well, cools our whole house very nicely. On a 95 degree day it works superb on low fan setting. Unbelievable how quiet this unit is (inside and outside). The install was easy and all the parts are of high quality. I'm glad to have spent a little extra for this cooler, a great buy!|Positive
Easy to install. Works great|Positive
No it was not powerful I don’t like it|Negative
I have been using MasterCool coolers in my Phoenix airplane hangar for 13 years. In fact I bought 2 over the years. Recently the motor burned out in the MMBT12 1150 cfm model. While waiting for parts to repair it I bought this Hessaire 2200CFM......I have to say, I am very happy that the MasterCool broke! This Hessaire not only throws out twice the volume of air, it actually throws out noticeably colder air! Don't ask me how, I don't really care, it is simply colder! The water that I use is actually hot from the hose due to overhead routing of the water supply. I was never thrilled by the MasterCool but thought that was how evap coolers are. This cooler works so well that I also bought the larger 5300 CFM model from Home Depot. When the parts came in for the MasterCool, I overhauled it and promptly sold it on Craigslist. Home Depot is completely missing the boat by not stocking these coolers in the stores. They are better than MasterCool, cheaper, don't slosh water all over the place when you roll them about, and wont rust because they are made of plastic. The casters are smooth and the unit rolls easily. Down side: Not much but a few things. There is a smell that comes off the cooling media when you first start these up. However if you run it for an hour or so, hose down the inside and outside of the cooling media, drain and refill the water, the smell diminishes significantly and eventually goes away. Basically a big rinse off. My unit had the float valve mis-adjusted from the factory. It did not stop the flow of feed water and the large water tank overflowed onto the hangar floor. I just took off a side panel, and adjusted the float. Easy, but should have been done at the factory. I have read complaints that the units made someone's house/shop/ whatever too humid. That is their fault. Evaps put moisture in the air! To work correctly you have to set up a flow of air, intake and exhaust. Open a few windows or doors to let out almost as much air as you are bringing in, a balance is required. Regardless, the area will have more humidity, but at least in Phoenix, that's not really a bad thing and I notice that my sinuses are better with the humidity when I use this thing. So...go out and buy this great cooler or it's bigger brothers. Tell Home Depot that it should be in stock and on the floor. Cuz right now, you have to order it for delivery. If you order it, pick it up at the store. They will charge you shipping if they send it to your house! 90 day no hassle return or exchange if you just have to have the more expensive, less effective MasterCool.|Positive
It was necessary to put in a different pump, belt, pully and adjust several times to get a goodwater flow to keep the pads wet enough. Not sure how it will work when it gets hotter.|Negative
I live on the 2nd floor in apt. As we all know heat rises. Here is my thoughts on this thing. You must fill up with ice every 45 minutes on a hot hot day. It works to cool your area down not cooler like AC nothing close to that. I put it by an open window in my living room and let it does its thing.I have a Honeywell 63 PT indoor portable Evaporative cooler works better than this|Negative
I found the Honeywell Portable Evaporative Cooler to be Great. It is very energy efficient and cooled off my living area very well. The only downside is, it is a little noisier than I expected but worth it if the helped Cool off the house.|Positive
Super great stuff easy to install !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|Positive
It worked great!|Positive
I considered all the less-than-five-star reviews and still decided to take the plunge. Man, I'm glad I did. I'm using it in an uninsulated garage. For good airflow, I keep the garage door open about 2-3 feet and also open a door to the backyard. This has been able to drop the temp to the upper 70s as the weather outside nearly hit 100 degrees. Looking forward to testing it in our dry 120 degree heat here in Phoenix. My only complaint so far is the plastic hose adapter seems easily breakable. So, be gentle attaching a hose (I actually use a quick-connect adapter. It make a huge difference), don't close the garage door on it, and it should last much longer.|Positive
I bought these cooler stand legs to support a 5500CFM swamp cooler, they work great, they are sturdy and self explanatory when installing. I only wished the website reported the inventory correctly, I could of had the Swamp cooler operating sooner for my customer 10 days sooner. website reported they were not available in-store. they are a seasonal item. all Swamp cooler parts were displayed in garden center after I made purchase online. I hope this review will help HD understand that the info provided online and actual products in-store need to match. All stores in the same valley of the same city should sell and stock the same items.|Positive
Easy to do worked as advertised matched my original|Positive
So far I am really happy with my new portable air cooler! I live in a one bedroom apartment with lots of windows, it seemed like I was loosing all the cool air produced by my air-conditioner unit through the windows, I decided to purchase, and begin running one of these units while I was at home for cooler air. It's been great! I am less hot while I am home, and I don't feel like i'm losing money out the windows while i'm not home!|Positive
Was received with damage. The box was not damaged so it obviously was boxed and shipped that way.Very poor quality control.|Negative
I ordered this cooler as a replacement for one I had that was rusted out. It is the same model #. When I received the new one it was smaller than the one I replaced. Also it was made of lighter metal. The panels with the fiber material were screwed on instead of having clips which makes removing them more of a hassle. don't know how well it will function as it is to cool now to really test it.|Negative
Just what I needed right quantity and fit along with a quick install|Positive
I looked for it and found it and now my cooler works like new|Positive
"No paperwork from manufacturer Dented from shipping Size was 0.24"" offLate to arriveNoting but problems all the way around"|Negative
Bought this for a little coffee shop we own. Works wonderful. Works best placed next to an open door.|Positive
Swamp coolers could compete well with energy hog a/c, but Essex, producer of Mastercool neither engineers nor builds these things right. First, product came damaged, and it seemed to be damage done at factory. Second, casing design makes access to electrical box difficult. You can't just unbolt the lid because there are bolts inside that are hard to reach. So, you have to disassemble more to do simple stuff. Third, big fan known for being noisy unit encased in drum like sheet metal box. I used spray glue to attach closed cell foam sheets to inside off casing to deaden sound, and insulate against summer sun. This could be done cheaply and better at the factory. Fourth, electronics are simple, but could be plug and play. I'm surprised CA tech company hasn't gobbled up this TX based tech midget minded company with flimsy electronics.|Negative
This actually works pretty well for it's small evaporative surface area. Good for a small...read small room. The pad material is so so, being some sort of plasti-paper derivative that doesn't soak up nearly as much water as say aspen or plain paper pads. The Crux of the matter. The fan isn't powerful or fast enough to ever 'cool' much. Evaporative cooling works by drawing powerful air over water soaked media. As a southern Arizona Boy, I'm well aware of what swamp coolers can do or not do. This isn't a good alternative. Okay for taking the temps down a few degrees on a hot day, but I miss the icy cold feel/smell of a proper swamp box on a hot day.|Negative
This product is very effective when you fill it with ice.|Positive
Cheap Simple Easy and Quickly service. What also to say!?|Positive
VERY difficult to read as if not exactly at your eye level, you see everything available, not just where you set it at, temp, mode, auto, manual.|Negative
I am happy with this purchase. The cooler works good better than a fan but doesn't make our place as cool as our a/c would. The upside is it doesn't use a lot of electricity or make too much noise like or a/c would. I would like for it to go up to the speed 3 when the cooler humidifier setting is on.|Positive
This was a replacement valve for a pond. The first one lasted more than 12 year before it started leaking. Hopefully this one will do the same.|Positive
New Air products have always been very dependable and at a great cost|Positive
This unit is so nice, on the low setting it's very quiet, not that it's loud on the high setting either. Worth the money.|Positive
It appears to be a good product. How long will it last? Time will tell if this is an excellent product or not.|Positive
very good quality canvas and the size was just a bit larger to fit nicely and allow for easy installation.|Positive
it works great for my shop|Positive
no didnt like pulley was bent and isstlled back word|Negative
Very efficient and relatively quiet operation. Creates less humidity inside house than previous evap. cooler|Positive
The pads did not fit, even though I was assured they would fit by one of the HD employees....I have had to insert extra styrofoam just so the pad would stay in place. Now, I am having to deal with leakage from the cooler as the pads still do not fit. The other brand Hope Depot used to carry fit nice and snug. Not sure I will be back to purchase these again from Home Depot. :(|Negative
the fan threw less air than my desk fan. the water pad was so solid and thick that the air could not penetrate. I am returning it today for a unit with 1300 cfm for the same price.|Negative
Product has a yellowish color, rubs off on clothing if rubbed against fabric. Hard to remove our yellowish color.|Positive
was what we expected and seem to be working well. See in the Spring when taken off how they held up.|Positive
MasterCool, Champion or Essikair or whatever name they hide behind has a build quality that is pathetic. The fan component has burrs and plastic bits on its leading edge—Makes it a lot noisier and less efficient. They roto drilled out a hole to pass the cabling through rather than use a mounted plug because the body is too thin and flimsy. Then they gooped it with silicon—amateurs. The rubber cushion grommets that amount the fan assembly to the body are way too thin and overtightened so the rubber splits and has little to to no dampening capacity. The control unit is prone to failure, mine gave out in a month, then a year later the second one goes and they now charge $60 for it and I have no cooling for more than a week. MasterCool did not design this, they made a poor imitation of a Bonaire Durango. Make no mistake, the Durango is the one to get. Evaporative cooling works, so any stars this product gets comes from this fact not the quality of the product.|Negative
Simple to install. Looks great.|Positive
I have owned several different evaporative coolers in the past and this unit has been the best one yet. One thing that I like most about it is that is has 3 different areas that draws in air instead of 1 like all the other coolers. Even with a smaller prop, it still throws out more air than the rest. Plus, you cannot argue with the price of the unit either.|Positive
This cooler was just as described. It was a little larger than I thought it would be but that was perfect for me since I'm using it to cool my greenhouse. It works well. The high fan setting really moves the air well.|Positive
Fit perfectly, came on time, picked up at Store, good to go.|Positive
I bought last year, 8 month later the water pump broke. Very week|Negative
Excellent fit, and especially like the Velcro closure...|Positive
It's big, it's ugly and it's kind of loud, but boy, does it work! Holds a lot of water and keeps going for 10 hours at least. Cools a large bedroom considerably, positioned in front of open door and with window ajar across the room. Here's the only downside. The water pump fails to drain the reservoir completely. We didn't operate the unit for a few days, and didn't realize there was a cup or two of water left. The water became musty, so I had to open the unit, clean and disinfect before I could use again. Now, every few days, I drain it from the plug in the bottom - problem solved. I've had other evap coolers that would pump until dry, and I never had to do this. This made me rate it good instead of excellent.|Positive
Just as some other reviews claimed, modifications were needed to make it operable. One motor mount was welded on crooked so nothing fit or lined up. The electrical connection point had to be modified also to receive the flex conduit. Other brands that I’ve used in the past were install ready.|Negative
This was a cool breeze to install! Lol it took me about an hour to assemble and install. We are cooling a 1300 SQ foot double wide in the southern AZ desert with it. Temperature has been in the mid 90's. Haven't had the fan over low yet. Cools great. Bring on the 100+ temp's we are ready!|Positive
"These pads are thinner than the original but fit well. My only gripe is that the two side pads should either be wider or fill the entire side and make the two center pads a little narrower (Option #2 would be my recommend). The sides don't quite fill in the entire grill, so there is a small gap. When you open the box, you will immediately be hit with a very strong ""chemical"" odor. After they have been out in the air for a few days, the smell will dissipate, HOWEVER; when you turn the unit on with water, the first time; WHOA there is a strong ""nail polish remover"" smell. I only ran it the one day yesterday, because my water fill valve started leaking, so don't know how long the smell will last. The unit was on for several hours before I shut it off. Fortunately the unit is installed in my garage to keep it cool. If you install in your home, be ready to be deal with the strong odor!!!"|Positive
"I purchased this belt as a replacement for the one I installed last year out of concern the present belt was on its last leg. Regrettably, this being a new belt, the fit was so tight that it would bind up the bearings on the squirrel cage of my cooler and, out of fear it would be the final straw for those bearings, I have yet to install it. Compared to the older belt, it seems much smaller, although I have no reason to suspect the belt was mislabeled. I intend to place this belt under tension to ""stretch"" it a bit in the hopes it will be ready to install should the need arise. I also bought a 56"" belt just in case but it is TOO long to use and I plan to return it. Oh, and I am unable to adjust the motor bracket to account for the increased tension because, as anyone who knows about, owns or has worked on a swamp cooler, all the hardware gets rusted after years of use and I'd rather not strip or snap a bolt and trash the cooler completely."|Positive
Screwed in the casters, filled up with water, plugged in the power, and sat back. Way back. Powerful fan. Used low speed only. Water supply is quickly depleted, so would recommend hooking up hose (with pressure reducer) direct to unit.|Positive
1st unit I received was a used unit someone returned with bad leds,and it didn't cool. It was replaced and the new unit doesn't cool either, tried it in workshop,added ice and no difference in temperature. Tried it in house with same results. It's just an expensive fan, that runs water thru the filter. It might work in 0-10 percent humidity but not in 80 percent.|Negative
Tie-down straps were plenty long enough to go around my large Mastercool and so far holding cover onto the cooler tightly. Hoping straps help to keep cover from blowing off in often strong New Mexico winds.|Positive
Motor power is very very weak. I have to put speed up to 3 to even get a fairly good breeze from it. I bought this same cooler last year and it had great power I don't know what they have done but this doesn't come near to the one I bought last year. A fan has more power. I am very disappointed|Negative
This unit blows cool air. I liked it so much I bought 4 more. I also just order the super big 8500 Sq ft one|Positive
This cooler had many problems: 1) it comes with no boot or lip for the side draft make-up 2) the color of wires out of the cooler bundle do not match the wiring diagram instructions, calls for a grey or brown for the pump, instead gives you another black. 3) the tubing feed to the water pump was cut too short and kept blowing off. Had to remove it from bracket to make it work (or go buy more tubing) 4) side panel drain tray slits were not opened up enough resulting in dry spots on the pads. 5) side panel metal is flimsy, so corners are easily bent making it difficult to reinstall panels. It was a very frustrating install, but once everything was remedied, it does seem to be working well.|Negative
simple and works well. EZ to move from place to place.|Positive
I love this evaporative cooler. Easy to set up. Easy to fill with water. Works perfectly for a small to mid-sized room when conditions are hot and dry outside. It was 90+ degrees outside and my room inside was low 70s. Very comfortable.|Positive
Excellent cover. Easy for me to get on|Positive
If you need one of these this summer for a window be it vertical or horizontal opening, this baby is the way to go. Yesterday it was 90 outside here in Reno NV and inside the 1930's home I rent was 67 degrees. Everything was great about this, packaging, product, performance, everything.|Positive
I knew this product wasn’t an air conditioner but I wanted something to help here in CA with the heat. I researched and read reviews and chose this product to help in the hot afternoon until it cools down in the evening. When filled with cold water and the ice packs it does cool the room a bit especially if sitting right in front of it. It’s not pretty but very quiet and it will humidify for about eight hours on fan speeds 1 or 2. Although it’s portable if I could do it again I’d opt for two desktop units so I could have one in the kitchen and one near my bed so they would be at the proper height.|Negative
"Loved the slim silhouette. Perfect for my deck. Seemed to cool the house adequately. (1400 Sq Ft) However, 1 star only. When turned on this plastic, made in Australia, swamp cooler's water splashed outside the vents and soaked the deck a full 12-15 inches around the base, as well as running down the window and over the electrical outlet that was 15 horizontal inches away. The unit was leveled, stable, properly secured. Called the US customer service for that unit. They tried to tell me the house water pressure needed to be adjusted as it must be too high and flooding the unit. NOT! The water level in the lower pan area was exactly where I set the float to keep it. No issues there. Then they said they would send me a new pump? The pump obviously was not the problem as there was water reaching the tray above the pads, was adequately full, and ... the tray was not overflowing in any manner. Told them, thanks but no thanks. Who wants to start rebuilding a $560 piece of plastic with no logical reasons being found. I did take the unit apart. Not difficult. Just a few screws. As best as I could determine, the holes in the trough, over the pads, were barely, if at all, OVER, the pads. Rather, the holes aligned up just barely on the outer edges of the pads and towards the inside edges of the vents. Even with the slant of the vents, water easily was splattering outside the unit .. and ending up all over the deck. Took the first one back. ( Home Depot, of course, processed the return with no problems. Love them for that customer service. ) Bought a second one, same model, same everything, hoping the first was just a lemon. NOT. Same issues. Took it apart as well. Had same mis- alignment issue. Returned it the next day. And, remember, this unit is plastic. No ""tweeking"" on it is possible. So, the Durango gets 1 star only. Then, bought a ' Made in USA ', metal box, RWC 50 Champion Cooler. Hugh in size comparatively ... but, tell you what! Installed it, turned it on, and works perfectly. As it is larger in all ways, it cools this house fantastically. Champion's chart shows the RWC 50 rated for 1200-sq ft. in Zone 2. My 1400 sq ft is easily cooled. Requested the free vertical conversion panel kit ( see installation instructions ) from Champion's 800 phone number ... as have narrow window openings. Received them quickly. Give the Champion Cooler a 5 star rating."|Negative
Excellent every thing was there and went together and was working quickly. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️|Positive
This was a direct replacement for a cooler installed 7 years ago. Works great. I hope this one lasts as long.|Positive
Has two tie areas, one on the lower half of a side for fitting and a bottom one to snug up so it doesn't come off. Only disadvantage is that it seems fairly light weight so I'm unsure if it will hold up more than a season.|Positive
‘‘Was easy to install and came with everything needed except motor. Had installed in couple of hours. Works great|Positive
1-easy to move,good quality durable in the market,the tank for water one of the big. 2-the best service , quick shipping to receive product.|Positive
Far superior and less pricey than its Arctic counterpart. I've bought two Hessaire portable coolers now, and they do not disappoint. I wouldn't use any other brand now.|Positive
Easy enough to put on. Wear gloves, the yellow dye will transfer|Positive
I bought one of these units several years ago and thought it did a good job. So I bought another one for the office. However, Champion has changed the water drainage system. The old unit just used a rubber stopper in the bottom of the unit and it worked fine. But the new unit has a detachable plastic drain plug. It works by inserting the threaded drain plug into a hole in the back of the unit and screwing a plastic cap onto the drain plug. The problem is the rubber washer on the drain plug does not prevent water from leaking around it and the cap does not screw completely onto the plug; the plug definitely moves around. The result is a mess with leaking water. It seems like a faulty design to me. I called Champion and they had no answer. The unit will be returned.|Negative
I was replacing the water pump in my evaporative cooler and this unit was perfect. Considering that there were several to choose from, I made the right choice. Dave|Positive
Canvas cover fit perfectly. Yes, I would recommend it again. It is a thick cover and protects the cooler as it should. Thanks.|Positive
Nice cooler, quiet, lightweight,easy use, easy to fill|Positive
Really helps cool the air in these 90 degree weather we've been having lately!|Positive
This is one of the few 220v evaporative cooler pumps that you can find in store. My last one lasted me about 3 years. It could have lasted longer but I forgot to drain and clean the cooler at the end of the season and the pump rotted out along with a few other things. As for the previous reviewer stating that it has the wrong plug, I don't think that is the case since this is a 220v/230v pump and not the standard 110v. It comes with the 220v connector as in the picture which has the 2 prongs sitting horizontal and not vertical. Most evaporative coolers are only wired for the 110v pumps. This is a good pump for those that are running a 220v main motor and want more water flow with less amp draw. You may have to re-wire your cooler to accommodate the 220v plug.|Positive
I returned it simply because it didn't cool as expected.|Negative
This is a great way to save on your electric bill, it's a cooler that is small so it doesn't get in the way. Would recommend. Keeps you cool.|Positive
"Review for the 4001DD. Found the unit easily in my local store after researching on the internet. It was clearly marked and well packaged. Upon opening the box, I was surprised to see a large plastic bag inside the unit with everything you might need for the installation, including both 120 and 230 VAC plugs for the motor, a new float valve, a new belt, pump, plumbing and an adjustable sheave for your motor if needed. Aspen pads are pre-installed. The biggest positive was seeing that the water pan is a stamped, one piece unit without any seams that would leak as some evap coolers do. My unit is curb mounted with 1/2"" sealtite housing the control wires and attaching to the upper corner of the unit. The only negative I can think of is the knockout (KO) for the sealtite connector wasn't punched nearly enough which required I drill the hole out to make my electrical connections. Other than that, its a solid, well working unit for a good price. Don't forget to oil your bearings as mine were dry on arrival."|Positive
work great|Positive
This product ran well for the first couple of days but then it started making a loud noise. We could get past that but about a month after we purchased the swamp cooler the motor wouldn't start. This product is supposed to last year's and yet it couldn't last one summer. Very disappointed.|Negative
This is a great product. I live in the mountains and my humidity is usually below 25%, so I don't run into any problems because the outdoor humidity is high. I generally get a few days during summer where the temps get up between 95 and 100 and before I got this evap cooler, my living room would heat up into the low to mid 90's. Now, I turn it on when the temp indoors gets around 83 and it keeps my large living room ( 360 sq. ft. ) between 80 and 82, but the humidity indoors gets up between 45% and 50%. I'm sure if I had it in a smaller room, it would even do a better job of cooling. From what I can tell, it is going through about 2/3 to 3/4 of a gallon of water per hour of operation and it is fairly noisy, especially when turned on high. I have a home theater system and I have to turn the audio up mid way to hear the TV over the noise, but anyone who is buying this is doing so to keep cool, which is what probably matters the most. I would definitely recommend this product.|Positive
worked okay, but wont be too good for anything over a one room.. If trying to cool large area or entire house, it doesn't have that power, but for a bedroom it does a nice job|Negative
It is of very good quality and I am very pleased with my purchase.|Positive
OK so I bought this for the Vegas summers. I put it in the bedroom, about 3 feet from the bed. Ran it at bedtime on the low setting with 3/4 of a gal. of chilled water plus 2 trays of ice. Temp. reads 78-79. Happy with that.|Positive
Cooler functioned well but failed to cool down my studio apt. below 86 here in Phoenix. It was very humid and had a heavy unpleasant odor coming from the new cardboard filter. I took it back and bought a portable electric which works better.|Negative
These had to be mounted on the second floor windows. Other than needing to extend the braces some, it went very well. Being able to set the units from the inside with some normal outside work made the job much easier.|Positive
It is better to use a fan|Negative
Virtually no cooling power. Essentially a noisy fan.|Negative
This fit perfectly over my swamp cooler|Positive
I live in Tucson, AZ and with the very dry weather we know all about evaporative coolers. This unit did very well, better than most...but. Good luck finding a replacement pump that fits in the constrained resourvor or replacement pads. If your creative and a bit handy you can modify a new pump to work or spend over $100.00 and order from Australia. Pads? I was just quoted $100.00 to have them custom cut. Was able to make a large 36x46 aspen pad with alot of creativity work.|Negative
We just installed this same pump last summer and had to replace it again this week. I question the quality of this product that only lasts one season. It's a very inexpensive product so maybe that should tell us something. To be fair we have extremely hard water with an abundance of calcium deposits still we have had pumps last up to 5 years. Fluke or not I cannot recommend this product.|Negative
I really like our new cooler.It keeps us from running the AC so much and hopefully it cuts down on my bill.I plan on buying another one for our bedroom.|Positive
I'm impressed by the sleek and modern design. Looks great and seems to work well.|Positive
The cooler was light weight and easy to install on the roof|Positive
With pads on 3 sides, this cooler definitely has the capacity to cool a 400 sq ft garage. Although I have used the unit for only a week, the results are impressive. The best that it has done is a 14.7 degree difference between ambient temperature and garage temperature. Pretty impressive. In July and August, when Arizona temperatures exceed 100 degrees, I expect the temperature differential to be better. One feature that I recommend to all evaporative cooler shoppers is the fill hose. Just connect the unit to a water supply, and it functions virtually hands-free. No need to be running back and forth with buckets of water. I know that the component with the highest failure rate is the pump. I hope that when the time comes , I can find a pump that fits this unit properly. One minor flaw: the water fill door could be larger.|Positive
The right-hand vent provides almost no air flow at all. I believe this is due to a mispositioned right-hand squirrel-cage fan wheel. I tried to reposition the wheel to better align with the right-hand vent but didn't have the right allen wrench. Either PMS or Home Depot should send someone over to fix this but oh right.|Negative
Changed out the 2.5 year old, original media with this in a horizontal outlet Master Cool 4800 unit. The old media just wasn't producing much cooling effect. This media, depending on the RH, can add a good 30% RH, with the resulting air temp. drop. It can 'overhumdify' the outlet air, but that's still cooler than the outside ambient air. This media set measures the same as the factory media. Installs without hassle, if one pays attention to the 'front' and 'up' direction marks on the media. One tip for Master Cool owners--Currently I get the most even water distribution by placing 2 folds of sunscreen cloth, directly on the media top, with the top plastic cover (that encloses the distribution pipe) fitting snugly down on the trimmed plastic cloth edges.|Positive
The Difference that this cooler has made in our barn has been amazing it is keep at-least 10 to 15ﾟ cooler than it is outside. I would definitely recommend this cooler for anybody with a barn|Positive
A bit harder to set up than I had originally thought it would be but works like a champ. Not as good as AC BUT It makes it cool enought to sleep at night and cools the place off enough in the morning to give the place a fighting chance at staying tolerable all day. Went from using over 400 kwH last July to using only 160 kwH this July, despite the month being 5 degrees warmer on average than last summer.|Positive
We are very happy wth the performance of our swamp cooler. The fan provides an ample amount of air flow and has reduced the temp by 15-20 degrees. Had a hard time getting the water line to seal at the float valve, replaced the brass sleeve with a nylon one from the hardware store. Problem solved. Wished we installed a swamp cooler years ago.|Positive
works very well and easy to install, having three guys to install did make it easy. The first week the circuit board smoked and burnt up, the warranty people have been helpful.|Positive
The fan motor is incredible. Blows very cold air .|Positive
"Ordered this online to the store and installed the whole new system myself. My main-level is 1,500 sqft and I installed 5 new vents (living room, kitchen, 2 bedrooms, and 1 office), this cooler is more then adequate to cool the entire house. The living room is a solid 75 ft from the cooler and power/coldness is still great. I live in Denver, Colorado and went with this one because it has a higher rebate from the energy company; I am really glad that I went with the higher-end one once I saw it in person and physically compared the quality of components. Love the high and low speed, high is very powerful and cools very quickly. Also can turn on fan and just vent on cooler nights when you don't need the extra coldness from the water. The extra thick 12"" media really helps with the efficiency as well. The cooler is not loud but don't install it right above a bedroom as you will hear it rumble when trying to sleep. I have it situated over a bathroom between two bedrooms and you can't hear the fan at all. Has a very clean and professional look to it unlike many swamp coolers. Only issue was that the control box and thermostat in the unit did not work correctly and took a little bit to trouble shoot. Bought a replacement thermostat in Home Depot and replaced the unit which worked and then warrantied the piece and returned the one I bought. Annoying but easy to install. (if your control box is opaque you may have a bad one...) Highly recommend. Key Components to help install this: - DIAL 20 in. x 20 in. Evaporative Cooler Roof Jack - Master Flow 8 in. x 25 ft. Insulated Flexible Duct R6 Silver Jacket + registers, elbows, collars, water-pipe, and we built the plenum ourselves from steel ducting boxes"|Positive
Quieter than the down draft unit but not as powerful. It comes fully assembled and quite compact in size. It does what it designed to do for small room. Good value for $170.|Positive
The package was missing a part and no user manual|Negative
worked just like it supposed to,first time!!|Positive
Unfortunately, the the product leaked everywhere. It worked pretty well the first time we filled it up then by the second time we filled it up, water leaked everywhere from the bottom, not through the fan. Mind you we barely moved it so there was no damage done to it or anything. The fan is nice but I rather just get a normal fan.|Negative
Good quality no problems installing, and good price|Positive
Works very well, I was concerend with construction quality mentioned by other consumers, but I have found it ti be a substantial unit! Very pleased...|Positive
This unit did not provide any change in air temp from the surrounding area. All it did was increase humidity.. I have used swamp coolers before and they worked great. I will be returning this one for a refund.|Negative
I have 3 and each keeps their room comfortable in our dry desert heat. If you have low humidity and can get a garden hose to refill it is better than window mounted coolers. I LOVE THEM.|Positive
This is the fourth motor I have replaced and I run them about 5 months per year. They have a one year warranty and I get about 13 months out of each one. Cooler originally came with a 1/3 hp motor so I replaced each subsequent motor with a 1/2 hp thinking it would easily handle the load that the original motor did. Home depot needs to offer a higher quality motor that will last longer. These motors are cheap and you get just what you pay for. I would gladly pay more for a better motor. Every one of mine have failed for the same reason, they start making a lot of noise(hum) when they are first turned on and the noise gradually goes away after about ten minutes. Sounds like the start circuit has failed and the motor will not come up to speed. If this fourth motor I just purchased on 6-9-17 fails soon I will find a better motor somewhere else. Heads up, Lowes sells the same motor.|Negative
Doesn't cool even in a small room. Bad decision.|Negative
Cooled my 1150 SQ FT house perfectly. Runs quiet on the low setting.|Positive
What a difference it makes in my room late afternoon when it's the hottest. Best purchase I made this year!|Positive
Worked out fine|Positive
"For a 2200 CFM evap, this one works great. There are only 2 issues that I have with it. First, the wire that runs the pump was not connected. I read another review on this site and saw that they had the same problem that I had. Namely the fan worked when I started it up but the pump would not work. I opened the panel under all the switches and sure enough, the red wire to the pump had come out of the connector. I had to re-insert it and crimp the connector and then the pump worked fine. The second issue was the water connection. It is a male 3/4"" pipe thread and the unit did not come with a hose adapter. I had to go to Home Depot and get a 3/4"" female pipe to female hoses adapter connector. Now it works great. The unit really pumps out the air and cooled easily my 900 plus sq ft area."|Positive
This cover fit my unit just fine. I hope it lasts as long as the previous one did.|Positive
Works very well, even when it is 100. I to use the high setting|Positive
Only worked for about a week.|Negative
I bought the cooler online and Home Depot shipped to the closest store at no charge to me. Great way to buy obscure items.|Positive
Fit perfect on my cooler and made of durable material.|Positive
I would give it no stars if I could. The 3 removable panels that hold the pads are made wrong. The louvers are cut in upside down. When it rains, they act like funnels. They catch the rain water and direct it into the pads. The pads become completely saturated and the blower starts pulling in water instead of air. Everything inside the house in front of the cooler gets sprayed with water. I did not install it in a window. I framed it into a wall, so I cannot take it back to return it or I will have a hole in the wall. Now we are stuck with a cooler that we cannot use when it rains. Will NEVER buy another Champion/Essick cooler.|Negative
Does the job it was designed for.|Positive
Didn't even get to use it. Once the item was delivered you can tell the item had already been opened. Opened the box and it was missing the remote. Tom it back without even taking it out of the box. NOT happy I was sold a previously used item as new.|Negative
great on the downdraft evap cooler.However would like to see a different style closure maybe a zipper would be much better|Positive
So I did a ton of research between evap coolers and portable ac units. Decided to try out the evap cooler first because it was less expensive at purchase price and for the electricity bill. I ended up on this one because I trust home depot and the products they have. I knew the measurements going in but didn't truly realize how big this actually was. Its a very similar size to a mini fridge but taller. In our apartment we only have one place to put the evap cooler because it has to go by a window and its size was just an eyesore. Ended up returning it before we even used it because we didn't like how it looked and after reading the manual it seemed like too much work for cold air. Ended up getting a LG portable ac unit which is smaller and puts out very cold air. I'd recommend going with the ac unit.|Negative
The unit is smaller than other units we have seen and yet cools better. Noise level is about equal to a floor fan. I particular like the ice feature. This cools the room down quickly even on the hottest days. This unit doesn't cool as much as an air conditioner would but certainly makes the room liveable.|Positive
We love this unit….this is our 4th one in about 35 years. Too bad it had a dent in the side of it when we unwrapped it at home. We noticed the box was pretty tattered when he brought it down on the forklift, butwas hard to inspect & even harder to ask him to get another one. It won’t show, tho.|Positive
The Champion cooler rated only 3* because of its construction and engineering. Home Depot’s delivery and service rated 5*.|Positive
I measured an 8 degree temp drop from this unit, so it does work just not very well. Not worth $600. Get a nice fan instead. I measured with a high water flow, lower flow, more and less outdoor air supply and both fan speeds. I was expecting a 15-20 degree temp drop. 40% increase in humidity. Used a yellowjacket digital psychrometer. Starting humidity was 37%. Location: Northern Colorado.|Negative
To load and even with no humidity is not very cool compared to others I have been around.|Negative
This is a great fan.. Filled it with cold water and some ice cubes and gave a very cooking affect. First day had a weird smell due to the lining that is used for soaking the water but it went away once we put couple of air fresheners next to it. It is a bit noisy and a bit too windy for small enclosed areas. I would recommend this for outside patio type setting or larger areas. The buttons feel a bit flimsy and plasticky but overall seems to be holding up well the first couple weeks of use so far Has 3 speeds but I have been using upto 2nd speed and that itself feels very windy in the 1000sq ft area. Swing motion is nice to circulate the air.|Positive
"I LOVE this thing. Even though it is bigger than I expected it to be it is such a cool (ha-ha) appliance I don't care about that. I have a small ""shop"" set up outside and I work out there a lot when the weather is nice. When it's not too hot I run the cooler just on fan and it does a great job- it has multi speeds and it moves a LOT of air even on low. When it's hotter I hook up the hose, throw in some ice and I have an outdoor air conditioner right in my yard-WOW! It runs on 110 so no need to worry about heavy duty wiring-it runs on regular house current and a 15 amp line. My wife had the girls over on a warmer day and they sat in the shade on the back patio with only the fan on at about 15' away and they were very comfortable. Why didn't I get one of these years ago? I hope you find this helpful."|Positive
works fantastically and does the job that is needed|Positive
It's quiet and strong I recommend it.|Positive
Using it in a screened in patio and while it uses lots of water it keeps us cool.|Positive
Just what I wanted|Positive
Previous cover shrunk. Couldn't believe it. This cover for perfectly and solved a leak from rain getting in from the old cover.|Positive
I bought two of these covers of different sizes,for two separate evaps, and I did review the 37 ins. Both are made of the same material. Treated canvas, made so it is water resistant. And rain did bead up and rolled right off. But I don't think it is stain resistant and most likely will discolor over time. Only 1 month now I have had it, so lets see how it will hold up over a 2 year period. I will repost if it fails...|Positive
Although it is brass, the hard water here in Az does a number on this product.|Negative
Absolutely love it. Ran out and bought another one. It was worth the 5 bucks more to get the one that moves in 360°. Well built and pretty quiet.|Positive
We actually need two of these units but wanted to test one first to see it in action. This unit does a great job cooling down our techs at the shop in this sweltering summer heat and can be moved wherever the action takes place. Received the item fast and well packaged. Easy to understand instructions are an additional plus. Overall, we are happy with the purchase and will go for the second unit.|Positive
Great price. Fit my MasterCool HC63, except I had to add some make-shift spacer bushings to the fan shaft, but that was no big deal. My swamp runs much quieter with this new pulley.|Positive
It was the perfect fit.|Positive
It is just an expensive fan. Doesn’t cool anything.|Negative
Excellent quality|Positive
The machine did not cool the room as I had hoped. It is an improvement but not quite what I had expected, It is in a small room, but it does not make the room cool even when the door is closed. it blows cool air, but again it is does not achieve what I expected.|Negative
Screws are cheap....try to get your own before installing,otherwise its all good|Negative
Product fit perfectly only problem is the smell from the oil on it. It takes a few day to go away|Positive
The cover was the perfect size and easy to install. Did not blow off in big winds.|Positive
The best portable swamp cooler I have ever owned|Positive
Works Fine.|Positive
"Super cold. More efficient than the outgoing 22+ year cooler we replaced and cheaper than trying to continually replace parts on the old one. The 3/4hp motor on the old unit died recently. We replaced that with the same size 3/4hp motor found at homedepot. Since the rest of the old swamp cooler died (all within a week) I used the new 3/4hp motor with this. This unit comes with an adjustable pulley so that you can fine tune the rpms so that you do not overload the circuit. For the first time this summer, my wife asks ""Is that on low, I'm freezing""? Yes it is, and it 's not even August yet :) Dock one star because the wiring they include was too short. The wiring from the old unit was about 5 feet long. The wiring with this unit was about 3 feet long. I had to use some of the old wiring to combine with the new. Aside from the wiring, this thing is a winner. You should note, (I'm reviewing the side draft unit pictured above ) this unit was little longer and wider than our old unit and it also holds more water. The old unit basically hanged off the side of the house, and the roof. Since this is larger and therefore heavier, I made a platform to hold support it from underneath. Very happy."|Positive
This works great! However, Home Depot needs to indicate on the product site which Champion (or other brands) evaporative cooler models this cover will fit. The dimensions listed online are deceptive and customers may believe that this cover will be too large for their evap cooler. We took a gamble based on the listed dims and it fits our Champion window evaporative cooler perfectly.|Positive
Home Depot is not at fault over this product as long as they accept the worthless thing back. Had it two days before the hinge on the water adjustment cover broke. Called Port a Cool and they sent a replacement part right out. The day the part arrived the fan switch would no longer work. This was 9 days total use. That averaged over $50 per day when you divide the purchase price by the nine days I was able to use it. I have used larger units in the past that worked very well. I guess they need to go back to the suppliers and get better switches as this seems to be a problem in several of the reviews on here.|Negative
Ordered this evaporative cooler (swamp cooler) for use on our back porch and inside our barn. Works great. Remember it is not an air conditioner but it does help cool the hot, humid southern air.|Positive
It leaked, never blew cold air even when ice was in tank. It sucked|Negative
Brian's side draft 42 in. x 52 in. x 35 in. cooler cover fit my roof mounted MasterCool perfectly and therefore took less than five minutes to cover the cooler. The cover held up well during the recent four days of severe thunderstorms. Time will tell if it stands up to strong New Mexico winds. Hopefully the extra tie down straps I purchased will help keep the cover from blowing away.|Positive
Amazing amount of cold air with 11,000 CFM! Unit arrived with a defective pump which Hessaire replaced for free with no hassles. We use this in one of our horse barns and I will be purchasing 2 or 3 more! I clean the pads with a hose daily and extract all the dirty water at least once a week with a separate pump since this is used in a dusty environment.|Positive
At this time, it is pumping water as it is supposed to do. It was a straight, one-to-one replacement I've only had it in for a week|Positive
Like the quality and the toughness of canvas versus the normal plastic covers.|Positive
Work well but I have hard water so it needs to be changed at least once before summer is over|Positive
the product was damaged like 7 out of 10 things I order on line with Home depot so now I have to order another one and pay another days wages to swap it out I think its time for some under cover boss at my local store receiving dept. this is an ongoing trend and careless handling of merchandise I have received boxes with crush marks dents and even holes from a fork lift blade. fortunately there is a Lowes close by I guess I will try doing the bulk of my on line orders there.|Negative
Awesome!!!|Positive
Live in New Mexico very hot here in the summer time 100 and more. I got this plus the 3600 CFM. To cool my home. I will write back to tell others if they work in hot temperatures or not Thanks|Positive
This Hessaire 5300 is perfect for my shop, my garage, it cools you down in the direct sun, I love it..|Positive
I am mainly concerned with the air filtration and cool air. Works great.|Positive
I bought this pump in April 2002. It just died in September 2015. Definitely worth the investment! For all those years, the pump kept my house crispy cold in the summer. My home is 1100 sf. I am told that this pump would handle a 1700 sf house. I never had a single problem with the pump until the day it died completely. I think 13 years of worry free use speaks volumes about this product. I will buy it again and again. I would also recommend it to others based on my experience. Note: To be fair, I need to note my general usage. Typically I ran the swamp cooler 12 hours at a time everyday. Occasionally I would run it 24/7 for a few weeks in the summer. However, I would turn it off for a few hours to let the swamp cooler motor cool down. 13+ years of reliable service. I have included a picture of the old pump! What a champ!|Positive
The cooler was delivered without any damage. Install was easy. The leg-attachments are a little flimsy and are not easily secured after adjusting. The pump and float are standard parts which will make maintenance good. Overall, a good economic cooler.|Positive
I am using this in my bedroom for really hot days when my window AC has trouble keeping up. While this thing does work pretty good in dropping the temperature down a bit, it is WAY too loud even on the lowest fan setting! It is much louder than my window AC unit. It sounds like a jet airplane taking off. Unfortunately I cannot use this while I sleep like I wanted to because it is so loud that it will keep me awake, what a bummer, because it works good otherwise.|Negative
It is a simple, direct cooler. It appears to be powder-coated in a tough finish--I sprayed undercoating in the pan for added rust protection. The large pulley on the blower shaft wobbles, but it doesn't seem to affect anything. I had to adjust the squirrel cage sideways a small amount as it rubbed on the housing. Some of the screws holding the body together were not tight and some could not be tightened. I appreciated the extra clips that hold the ends of the water distribution spider. It cools our house very well. I've had it working now for a couple of weeks.|Positive
Easy to assemble, light weight. Blows air out very good.|Positive
Plenty p[owerful, easy to install|Positive
Pros: 1) Great fan. Cools me off if I'm sitting in front of it. 2) Customer service was helpful when I sent the first unit back because it did not cool my small space. They sent me a new unit, after I sent the first back. Cons: 1) Doesn't lower the temperature of any of my small rooms. (My AC is already on and I'm in a dry space.) 2) It is loud. With all honesty, I cannot recommend this product, even remotely. It is a glorified fan. I've tried twice. With that money, I could've bought a few great fans to leave in my rooms. I know other products work, because my colleagues have them and use them in Arizona rooms, with great success. Just wish I had put more effort in to researching this. I thought it would be awesome to add some crisp cool air to an already air conditioned space. I suppose it does do that, because that's what a FAN does. It improves the wind chill. Any fan can do that. Don't spend $200 on one!!|Negative
Easy to install, works freat, is slow to start but gets going ok.|Positive
I love our Evap cooler! We live in Flagstaff AZ and homes are not equiped with AC, which makes summers very hot! It could get up to the 90's in our home last June! We've had our unit for a week and we are loving it! It cools very fast too. I've noticed a 5 degree temperature difference in just 20 minutes of use each time I turn it on. I know our summers are going to be very comfortable now.|Positive
the belts fit our swamp cooler perfectly and are durable|Positive
Completely changed the usability of our summer workspace. Best investment in years.|Positive
I found it to be very good for what I needed but it would be a little better if there was some kind of water level detector that was easier than shaking it to see the level|Positive
fit perfect|Positive
This product is a glorified fan. This will not cool even the smallest room it will only blow warm air around it. Waste of money.|Negative
For some reason motor burned out after 2 weeks.Followed all directions was replacement for one been on for years.very unexpected.|Negative
More than expected and then some.|Positive
You don't want to have to go on the roof in the summer if you don't have to! When it comes to float replacement time I spend a few dollars extra and don't have to go on the roof in the middle of the summer to adjust the float! I get about three years out of each one and that's OK with me!|Positive
Great product! Have used other brands of evaporative coolers and was dissatisfied and returned product. Bought this for the garage. It works so well that we use it inside the house also to help cut air conditioning costs.|Positive
It’s ok Could blow more air for the 950 sq. ft. it’s supposed to cover|Negative
It was a replacement for a 20 year old one, and it fit and works great. Very easy installation.|Positive
It worked perfect to replace the old brocken one.|Positive
The cooler works great.|Positive
I bought a smaller version and love it so I got this one. Not even a month and already the water pump stopped working. Controls don't work either. Very disappointed.|Negative
Replaced an old rusty mobile air unit...this is quiet, lighter ,throws air farther, and oscillates BEST FOR THE MONEY THAT I COULD FIND ,,,,,thanks Jesse Metcalf...|Positive
This cooler set-up was easy. It works really good. Keeps my home cooler than my old cooler. Love it.|Positive
Good evaporative a/c unit for patio. Works well, easy to use and provides cool air circulation for smaller areas.|Positive
This was a good belt,easy install,seems to last about seven years.Good bargain.|Positive
excellent design and functional controls, price excellent when compared to others rate, good hi end/excellent low end 250 sf could be increased (using in a 11x12 room) need to use it right near/on you. when the weather is high temperatures and humid, has been lately (so. ca.)|Positive
PRODUCT CAME IN SEVERAL DAYS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED AND I WAS ABLE TO PICK IT UP ON A SATURDAY...IT WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED AND WAS SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN STATED DIMENSIONS TO ALLOW FOR SHRINKAGE...HEAVY DUTY AND FIT MY UNIT PERFECTLY...|Positive
This wasn't even as good as a very inexpensive fan. Brought no relief. With or with out ice added. Wound not recommend and returned within hours.|Negative
It’s just ok. Was hoping for better value for cost but it cools ok at best|Negative
The portable swamp cooler is working nicely; and cools my fly-tying/rod building shop (area of approx. 242 sq ft.); to a tolerable level on hot (90-100) degree days. The area is the back of extended garage space (11.5 ft X 21 ft); where I installed a small (3 ft X 3 ft) slider window for circulation|Positive
This has worked excellent for cooking my home. Works better than the master cool I have already. It is a bit louder but it pushes considerably more air. It’s a huge upgrade and was easy to set up and install.|Positive
My first experience with a swamp cooler and needed new cover .... this one is perfect. The 'handyman' who installed it for me said it fit well and is good quality ... so I'm a happy camper !!|Positive
Met the need|Positive
"Winter is afoot and time to ""winterize"" that swamp cooler and this is the cover. Not only does this cover protect your swamp cooler unit itself during harsh cold winter days but does not allow your heat to escape out through unit and keeps the cold air from seeping in. Win-win! Covers come in most all size of swamp cooler units like down draft roof units as well as wall mounted units. Cover is a well made stitched together material. Has a pull tight slide rope for bottom and comes with rope to slip through eye hooks to secure to unit. So far this cover has survived high winds and I am sure it won't blow off."|Positive
Nice cover|Positive
I have owned 2 Hessaire 3,100 CFM 3-speed Portable Evap Coolers for the last week. It is a very short time to give a full evaluation but as with all Home Depot orders I know they stand behind the products so I am content in thinking I will have no problems. I purchased them for my work shop. We have tried both of them and they seem to have great output. One of the factors in my ordering these particular coolers is the small area they will take up in the shop. Many coolers take up way too much room for the shop with constant exchange of equipment and people. These are smaller in size but certainly blow across the shop. They arrived well packaged, however were dropped off at the end of the driveway (not really sure why since there has been so much about package pirates) luckily someone was still there as it was later in the late afternoon. They roll VERY easily with minimal effort across the floor. They seem a bit loud if you are right in front of them and are on the high setting, however if you are a distance away the sound is lessened. My entire shop is impressed. Come on Arizona summer we are a bit more ready for you this year.|Positive
OK|Positive
It's been wonderful since my Down-Draft Roof Evaporative Cooler was installed. It's working great and I'm so glad that I have it. The weather has been hot and I've been cool, cool, cool. :-) I would recommend this product to everyone. I've had this for a week now and was dying of the heat since my old one went out. It is doing it's job and keeping my whole condo cool.|Positive
"I bought this last May to replace a Bonaire Ultracooler. This unit is far more advanced than the Bonaire. However the ""low"" fan setting is faster. I wish it was more gentle. I like the UltraCool low profile, unobtrusive grey color, cool blue display, timer and oscillating feature. The almost five gallon tank capacity enables this baby to pump for eight plus hours when the weather turns hot and dry. My only real complaint is that, after more than four months of intermittent pumping the toxic stink of the filter remains in my bedroom. Within a few minutes of exposure I get used to it and its no big deal but be forewarned the odor does not dissipate after ""after a few hours"" as Champion states in the instruction manual."|Positive
"I have had this product 10 months. The media comes in six a pieces and two styrofoam spacers and the smaller top media extensions. Mine is 29""H x 41""W, requiring the spacers because the cabinet is an inch wider than the main media sections. The spacers, are 28"" high, an inch shorter than the media, creating a draft on the side of the media, causing water to be drawn into the blower cabinet and then leaking out of the bottom. The kit also lacks the fiberglass distributor filter, Champion 110120, for the top of the media, compounding the problem. The concept is good in general but poorly executed. Because of the problems with assembling all the pieces, I would not recommend this media for anything larger than 28""W x 40""H x 8""D, but you will need to buy the distributor filter for any installation."|Negative
This product exceded my expectations. Very easy installation.|Positive
Purchased this cover about 3 months ago. It is made with good quality canvas. It fits very well ( there are several sizes to choose from). There is draw string around the bottom. Time will tell how well it will last.|Positive
I was really suprice how this item doing it’s job. Awesome for a small space.|Positive
"This works SO well. I love the timer aspect except you have to set it before you leave and it only runs continuously for that amount of time. There is no way to get it to turn on while you're gone, even with a plug in appliance timer, it shuts off and doesn't restart until you hit the power button on the unit. . Also, with the water full it's only enough to keep it on the ""pump"" or ""evaporative"" setting for 4 hours, not sure why the timer runs for 8. When the water is low the alarm beep will CONSTANTLY beep until you turn off the pump mode or fill it with more water. Pros: it does cool my entier 500 sq ft apt. very well. If it weren't for the timer issue I wouldn't have to put in my window ac unit! It works beautifully in this dry colorado climate. My only real complaint is that I can't get it to kick on with an appliance timer while I'm gone to cool my place during the hot times of the day. Secondly: it runs for about 4 hours on low (with water pumping) on a full tank of water."|Positive
"I install all kinds of swamp coolers and I have installed at least a dozen of these. They are easy to install but you must be aware of the basic requirements this cooler needs to make it work properly for you . 1). they must be secure i use 6 x 4"" brass self drilling wood screws to hold a 2' x 2' x 1"" thick plywood square to keep the unit away from the wall this will make the cover go back on with ease. 2). the water line from the pump can kink when putting it back together watch for this. 3). check your pump is working before you put it all back together again. 4) the drip system is optional for you to use if your water supply is full of minerals use it. 5) i shave a fraction of an inch off the hooks that holding together ti make it go back together without resistance. 6). using the pads for more than two years will decrease the cooling capacity. 7). I have replaced the remote control switch in 50% of the units i have installed. There a great unit but do require attention."|Positive
The cooler works great, but I'm in a 500 sqft garage. Fairly quiet for the air flow, and the swivel action of the louvers is awesome. When not hooked up to a hose, pump stops pumping water when it's still a third full. All in all, I'm happy, especially since I got it on sale.|Positive
None oilable bearings are super loud...like a rock tumbler|Negative
This product is OEM only better than what came in my unit from the factory. This is two main pieces instead of four smaller pieces.|Positive
It works well|Positive
This is the best float for any pool float auto fill installation you can get save money by not having to call your pool service man to repair the side this is the best price anywhere and you can install it yourself.|Positive
Very powerful fan, which cools things off well. Not sure how effective the humidifier is for cooling, but we've had some extra humid (for S. California) days. It is easy to use and has made my bedroom habitable for sleeping which is primarily why I purchased it.|Positive
Really efficient and quiet. The price was reasonable and it is a nice sleek looking unit. The only awkward thing is the filling; hard to get to if unit is close to a wall.I have had and used it for one month.|Positive
Works great (except when it's really humid, of course). I would recommend it to a friend. The only thing I would pick on is the door one opens to add water. It is pretty thin plastic with a latch (same plastic) that does not look like it will last a long time. Kind of cheesy. Other than that, it works and performs as advertised.|Positive
Pricey but perfect.|Positive
The product was exactly what I needed for covering my evaporative cooler during the winter. It is high quality and fits my unit perfectly. Very good value for the money.|Positive
Excellent|Positive
I stay in L.A ...It really works the only think is a little bit loud when u turn on the water pump ... But it does the work...|Positive
Lightweight. Portable. Carrying handle and on wheels. Works great|Positive
Not good enough for my room in the attic.|Negative
I’m impressed with the simplicity and ease of installation of this item. It looks like replacing worn parts will be easy. I bought it to lower the temperature and raise the humidity of my aviary. It does a perfect job of keeping my aviaries below 86 degrees during 100+ weather.|Positive
Does an excellent job of cooling a small to medium size room in a short time. When it's 95 outside this unit make it comfortable inside without using an air conditioner - No FreeOn is used only water and ice. Quiet and easy to setup and use! I will be buying a second one for a bedroom soon.|Positive
Love it! It's just perfect for my patio and back yard!|Positive
Easy installation after the struggle of removing the old ones. got them installed and the cooler operational just in time for 80s & almost 90*|Positive
It is not as cool as a regular air conditioner, but good enough for a small space. It is very portable and can work outside of the house. Pretty quiet compared to air conditioner and other fans.|Positive
It worked great|Positive
Did not cool. Water pump did not work.|Negative
gets so cold so quickly.|Positive
Great air conditioning unit! Runs like a box fan for electricity cost, so anyone will not have an expenisve power bill. Add water and if you want add ice at the top to cool your room down even more! Just follow the instructions in the hand book that is provided for care and maintenance and any individual will love this machine!|Positive
I'm a massage therapist, and this fan provides good cooling in my treatment room.|Positive
This Honeywell evap cooler works great and is so inexpensive to operate. It costs about 4.5 cents per hour compared to about 50 -55 cents per hour to run my central air. Keeps the air fresh in my bedroom as it exchanges stale inside air for fresh outside air. The 90 degree nights here in Palm Springs have been tamed and I'm sleeping well with no nightmares about hugh A/C bills at the end of the month. This evap cooler works best in a dry climate so if you live in a high humidity climate it won't cool well like it does in the desert.|Positive
This cooler met my expectations in every way.|Positive
these were originally $98 finding them for $60 was great. they arrived quickly I like that. the only problem was one of the 8 holding clips was missing. I rescued one of the old ones so it worked ok but it is disappointing to not get everything promised.|Positive
Not sure about the louvers, the whole unit seemed tinny and lacked a solid feel|Negative
This was the only grill they had and it’s kinda cheap I hate to hear the louvres clatter and make noise, if that doesn’t bother you it’s a great product.|Negative
Worked perfectly.. Better than the one it came with.. Very happy|Positive
"The master cool water tray is lined with plastic to help avoid corrosion and the 12"" pads seem to keep my shop air dryer than standard swamper pads."|Positive
The cover fit.|Positive
The only issue I had with product was there was no drain in the water tank. How can much can it cost to put a drain hole in the bottom of the water tank ? It will be hard to empty tank at the end of season.|Positive
Awesome cooler for the money. Cools off front of my house and I have another 1 that cools off the back of the house. Total is 10000 CFM .. I like to cool in the summer. Super quiet and the remote works on both of the coolers.|Positive
Well made, sturdy and reasonably priced. Just got it on today so we'll see how it lasts through the winter.|Positive
It leaked all over the floor and I had to return. The lady at the returns counter was very helpful!|Negative
Fit well. No flaws in manufacturing. Went on easily. Comes with a rope to tie the side together and another rope going around the bottom to secure it.|Positive
Works great to cool down my garage shop on a hot day!|Positive
Worked great out of the box. Especially effective in semi-arid Denver.|Positive
This doesn't cool anything at all! It's awful waste of money.|Negative
Being a user of the old swamp coolers I know how they are in the hot weather....It did the job as well as I expected. It is not an air conditioner, it just helped the bedroom cool down as the evening cooled down. Good idea to open a window a bit to get air flow. Moves around easily and could use it in any room. Easy to fill and did not leak. Cleaned the filters off and on but did notice it would get a swampy smell to it. Had to wipe off the tubing of the pump (very gently!) felt slick but not slimy. My little house got very hot so that was probably a factor as the water would stand in the container while I was gone for the day. When I switched to bottled water it was much better. I liked it and would recommend it.|Positive
The evaporative cooler motor is working just fine.|Positive
Works well. Good fan with oscillation. Would like larger water fill spout to reduce spillage. Doesn't seem to cool as much as straight water cooler without filtering function.|Positive
Bought the motor and installed it and it overheated in less than 5 minutes. I have to get another one and see if it works this time. So I'll give it one more try|Negative
This product does blow cooler air, but not enough to pay $140 for it. It goes through its whole tank of water in about a day and you cannot remove the tank to fill the water which is inconvenient. I had to have the fan right in front of me to feel a difference. As to the claims of cooling an entire room? Far from the truth. This product does not make for a good replacement/supplement for an AC.|Negative
We live in the SoCal mountains and the unit keeps our cabin about 8 - 12 degrees cooler than the outside temperature as long as the humidity levels are below 25%. So, it is helpful, but not the same as a regular air conditioner (of course, the cost is much less too). Biggest complaint is that the unit is very noisy. Otherwise, it is satisfactory.|Positive
Very easy to assemble. Cools great! We also love the oscillating feature.|Positive
It did a pretty good job keeping the room cool. Just make sure to add to the top. I did notice though that it got the carpet and floor a little damp but other than that I was pleased with it.|Positive
"The cover that comes in response to the 15""x15"" skew is marked 14""x14"" and fitting showed 14"" is what it is. Same item easily acquired in the physical stores. If you rip out a seam and sew in an extension it works, but you need to seal it, I used duct tape."|Negative
this is my favorite style of float|Positive
Works really well. Big reservoir for water. Ability to regulate water usage is helpful.|Positive
Product fit perfectly. No problems with ordering,delivery orphaning roduct.|Positive
Powerful fan, has a bit of noise but not much more than our usual fan. Happy with the colder air it produces!|Positive
It is a great swamp cooler and easy to install and I love it|Positive
Good stufff|Positive
The cooler stopped working after about 30 minutes,|Negative
Champion cooler… True statement... this cooler keeps my house so cold that it has become a special treat in my house to turn on the cooler and get cold. Easy installation… My dad and I did it ourselves. I think I got a special deal on the price too.|Positive
It seems to work fairly well even though it's was extremely hot. We were able to eliminate the smell when you first start it by rinsing the reservoir first. It does go through some water, about 1.5 gallons an hour on low.|Positive
I wrote a review of this cooler last summer and gave it 5 stars even though the pump switch broke.... well, a month after that review, the pump broke. PortaCool replaced the pump for free since it was still under warranty (this was a separate issue from the pump switch failure issue it had). Now, a year later, the pump broke again. PortaCool replaced the pump again, for free, even though the warranty is expired because they said this unit has problems with defective pumps; and they've had to send out quite a few replacements to people with the same issue. These pumps only seem to work about 1 to 3 months then break. Unfortunately mine broke during the record heat here in North Texas and still waiting for the replacement to arrive.. Not optimistic that this new pump will work any better than the previous ones.|Negative
We are familiar with window swamp coolers and they work really well for us, even better than room air conditioners. They put out the cold air very impressively. This is the first portable model we have tried. I bought this for a small enclosed patio room. We live in northern Arizona. The room was about 90 degrees when I started. I gave it a couple of hours, either being in the room with it, or checking on it very frequently. It made the room humid, almost like a steam room, even with ample ventilation. If you stand right up to it, you can feel cool air blowing out, but two feet away it makes no difference, except humidity. On high, it sucks up the water extremely fast. I had a slider door open about five inches right behind it, and another slider open across the room about three inches. All windows are curtained, but I pulled the curtains aside a little for ventilation. Man oh man, was it miserable in that little room ! I am returning it and am going to try the Honeywell model for 650 sq. feet which I notice has the evaporative mats on three sides. I think if you are going to sit in an easy chair with it blowing right on you, and you like humidity, it will be okay, but I really wouldn't recommend it.|Negative
This motor was a perfect replacement motor. Relatively easy to install - plug and play style. Works well so far at about a month of use.|Positive
not bad will have to see how it holds up for the winter don't seem to be very sturdy material|Negative
The information on the box is insufficient to make an informed purchase. It is not until you get home and open the box and read the instructions that you learn the device really needs to be placed near an open window to best function. The room I am trying to cool does not have such a window, so I had to return the unit. The box does make it clear it is not an air conditioner, but I feel more intel on the package is needed.|Negative
Not very effective at cooling. Does not meet expectations.|Negative
I purchased this last year I do not like it yOu have to sit directly in front of it to feel anything it was a waste of my money I wish I could have returned it but to late that's my opinion someone else may like it it sure did not work for|Negative
PRO: Quiet, cools quickly, shallow profile CON: My unit leaked around overflow, not through bleed-off. New overflow assembly on order since Friday. Meanwhile, put duct tape around overflow leak: bleed-off tube then began working--at over 10 gallons per hour, 100 per day. Put push pin in bleed-off.|Negative
Was a perfect fit for my swamp fan cooler.|Positive
"This seems like a great idea in a climate with high heat and low humidity. However, it was just way too big and my wife said ""NO!"". Check the size and realize how much space it would take up! I never turned it on, but the machine seemed to be well made, is not real heavy and 'swamp coolers' are the way to go if you are in a hot, dry climate! Home Depot was quite good about the return."|Negative
Our only problem was that the cover is too large. However, our cooler is ancient and not of a size that is readily available. with a bit more string it is a tight fit. Down side is that the accompanying literature shows 3 sets of eye holes for the ties but only two exist which makes it difficult to get a real tight closure.|Positive
I just bought one of these and boy does it ever work well! I have an older 1200 sf manufactured home on a permanent foundation -with a 600 sf stick-built permanent addition on a conc slab. This is ALL the cooler I need and a very easy installation for a 75 year old.|Positive
We live in Orange County and our AC unit isn't strong enough to cool one of our bedrooms. So it's always at least 10 degrees warmer than the rest of the house. So after reading the reviews I bought this. Now, it works but for our room the difference is so minuscule that it's a waste of money. The fan itself is nice and strong as is the cooling feature but again, the difference is barely there. So I'll be returning the unit. Looks like I'll need a small AC unit instead.|Negative
Product claimed to change temp -20 degrees. Actually only 3 degrees. Looked great, was easy to use, but we returned it.|Negative
easy to replace,came with new clips.|Positive
Our Luma evaporative cooler has served us well in a rather unconventional usr---to keep our laying hens cool during the south Texas summers---will certainly buy another one whenever the occassion arises.|Positive
This was a useless product. It was employed in ideal conditions for an evaporative cooler: bone dry air in an enclosed but vented space run for hours with a continuously refilled reservoir that produced no cooling - just moved hot air. NO stars. Zero.|Negative
THE INSTALLATION WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD AS ONE WOULD EXPECT.|Positive
Fit perfectly and look great with no defects noted.|Positive
"For those that will say that I'm not living in the right area for this junky evap cooler to work.. I live in Phoenix, Arizona. Its about 8% humidity right now.. I performed an experiment, very simple one, to test just how much different this thing is from my current 20"" high velocity fan that I also bought at Home Depot. I put a magazine 12 inches away from the grill of this evap cooler, let the cooler run for 15 minutes blowing at the magazine. I have a laser thermometer used for HVAC applications that I used to measure the surface temp of the magazine. After 15 minutes the magazine was at 80 F (house temp is 87 F). I did the same thing with a 20"" high velocity fan. Ran that for 15 minutes blowing at the magazine a foot away. Temp of the magazine was 84.5 F. So the $250 ""cooler"" only cools 4.5 degrees better than the $45 fan. You can only imagine that the further away you are from the cooler, the less the air is cooled that reaches you or the part of the room that you want to be cooled. I also measure the temperatures right at the grill using the same laser thermometer. Temps were pretty much the same. 80F at the grill of the cooler and 85 F at the grill of the fan. One positive thing about it, if I can call it that, is that this unit reaches 1kWh in 5 hours. My costs for 1kWh from my power company is around 9 cents. So to run this unit is quite cheap, 9 cents per 5 hours. Anyway, this thing is going back to the store."|Negative
They were a little long. Knew that when I ordered them, but they were the closest to size I needed. Otherwise, exactly what I was wanting and expecting. Pick up was fast and easy|Positive
Great Product.|Positive
This cooler is rated a 2800 CFM. No way! On low it has the output of a small fan and on high it just gets really loud with hardly any noticeable difference in output. I tried out a second identicle one to make sure and it was the same. Unfortunately I designed a custom mounting system for a job sight trailer around this cooler before I plugged it in and now I'm stuck with it. The trailer is 20'X8'X7' (160SF,1120 CF) and it barely keeps it cool. I do not recommend this cooler.|Negative
Very powerful, effective, can be loud when on high setting. Takes a lot of water to fill and only lasts 5 hours when on max setting until water must be refilled. Literally no detailed instructions about working dome parts of machine. There is a hose hook up that seems to work but we havent figured it out yet|Positive
The pads are exactly the right size. Installation was a bit more difficult than I had remembered but I was able to complete it. The swamp cooler is now cooling my greenhouse quite nicely. The price and shipping were very reasonable.|Positive
This unit easily cools my 1900 square foot house when the outdoor temp is 100°F by simply cracking the windows in each room and letting it flow through. We turn the pump off at night, or it has to be turned to low, or the house drops to 50°... a bit too cool. Cheaper to run than our window A/C unit that only cooled approximately 300 square feet effectively. Great product!|Positive
Excellent cooling.|Positive
The air was never really cold even when ice water and/or gel pack was placed in the water compartment. Also, the swing light burned out right away after 1st use and the whole thing randomly shut down while using it. I was able to return it to the store so that was basically the only good thing...|Negative
It does okay, for the front section of my mobile home, which is all I really needed.|Positive
I bought it as a gift for my husband and he loves it.|Positive
Exactly what we needed for our back patio out here in the desert. There are absolutely no complaints with this product. We can now enjoy our back yard during summer...finally|Positive
It was easy to install and works good.|Positive
Cools well but does have to be filled regularly and sometimes it is inconvenient to keep it full.|Positive
worked just fine.|Positive
"We bought the MCP59 evaporative cooler, and it works amazingly well in our house. Our house is right at 1,500 square feet, so we opted for the next-larger model (this one), over the selection guide suggestion. I installed the unit myself. It would have been easier with one other person helping hold the unit while I negotiated fasteners and supports, so I would recommend this is a two-person job. Once we installed it and connected the water and turned it on, it went to work immediately. It wasn't 10 minutes before the house was cooling quite nicely. We had opened two windows in the far ends of the house (a CRITICAL part of using an evaporative cooler), and that was that. The only downside is that the fan is pretty loud. We don't operate the unit at full power when people are in the living room, but at night we blast it out to create good sleeping weather. I would strongly recommend evaporative cooling to anyone who lives in a desert environment. Last summer we saved about $250 PER MONTH on our electric bill, as compared to the years before when we had a conventional compressor ""central air"" conditioning unit. We will stick with evaporative cooling, at least as long as we're in this house."|Positive
I used this to replace a pool leveling valve, it worked perfect.|Positive
Grill cover fits good and it does cover the cooler completely|Positive
Very nice cooler, cools off our apartment very nicely. Would recommend it very much!!|Positive
Heavy duty and has ropes to tie down. So far so good. Had less then a month.|Positive
Light and easy to install, good quality. Remember your motor, you can choose a few different HPs for this unit FYI|Positive
It was exactly as measurements sId.|Positive
Worked great! Big and well made.|Positive
The overall quality of this cooler is awful. It's noisy and leaked water on the floor. For the time it was operating it didn't cool the room. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.|Negative
This product looks like it will protect my air conditioner during the winter months. Thank You.|Positive
I must have got one that was returned as defective as this one did not work. My first pump failed so I picked this one up, when I plugged it into the swamp cooler and it didn't work...I thought it may have been the wiring but after taking it apart to verify, I found electrical was okay and this pump didn't work (plugged into benchtop receptacle).|Negative
Works great|Positive
good product to use easy set-up.|Positive
This little cooler does double duty, even when it is 100 degrees & humid. The fan is powerful, the controls easy to figure manage, the water container easy to load (unlike other coolers I have tried) the unit is easy to maneuver, and all in all, it is a blessing.|Positive
Easy to get in and smells wonderful while in use|Positive
Product worked great in our camper! Had it hooked up to our solar panel too! We were off the grid in the desert. There's a slight smell when the interior cardboard mesh is getting wet,but, it's only temporary. Highly recommend. We plan on using it in our house when summer is in full swing|Positive
Fits fine on our swamp cooler.|Positive
PADS WORK GREAT. COOLER IS WORKING GOOD AGAIN.|Positive
Product did not work as advertised and leaked all over the floor of my warehouse due to poor fabrication. PortaCool support has yet to reply to my email. I have already returned it to the Home Depot store I picked it up from.|Negative
'Tis working just fine so far. Was easy to set up, easy to fill, and does just what was expected.|Positive
The cover is sized perfectly so it was a snug fit.|Positive
The cover was very heavy duty canvas and fit perfectly. Installation was extremely easy.|Positive
This item fits and works great very happy with filter|Positive
Good replacement when someone needs a pump but low on cash.|Positive
It works as it should, just would be nice if it didn't show up with a bunch of dents in the top|Negative
Ur basically paying $400 for a big fan! Does not cool down at all.. Dont waste ur money on this not worth it!|Negative
I was excited to find this cooler. I like the slim profile and it will fit well. I received the cooler and realized that I needed to order the surge pump separately. I called Essickair and ordered it. I waited a week and did not get it. I called their customer service and I was told it was on back order. I took the cooler out of the box and saw that the surge pump plug was not properly mounted on the inside of the fan housing section. I called their customer service about 3 times and even emailed them photos of the defective unit. Essickair was not helpful at all. I sat there and looked at the cooler, trying to figure out how to access the cables without causing any damage. And then I figured it out. The main front vent cover is affixed with 4 screws, which are covered by white rubber grommets. I used a really tiny screw driver and popped the rubber gromets off. I was able to unscrew all 4 screws. I carefully pulled back the front cover and had to unclip a wire connector. I was then able to access the surge pump power cord and fix it. My own trouble shooting saved me from returning the unit. I am hoping that the cooler is worth it. I remain optimistic. The units predecessor got a lot of good reviews. I will try to upload some installation photos next week. I am mounting the unit in horizontal sliding window and I custom built a framed out box to fit in the window. I will insulate the gaps. The reason I built the box is so that I can close my wood plantation shutters when I'm not using the cooler.|Negative
The product did not meet my expectations. I plan on returning it to Home Depot as soon as possible.|Negative
No cooling, it’s only a big humidifier|Negative
Unfortunately this unit functions more like a fan on low than a swamp cooler.|Negative
Worked like a champ. Kept my workshop (20x10) cool.|Positive
At high speed it is noisy. Fan area is too small. Swing indicator lite went out, but still working.|Positive
Fair at best. Not worth the money. While it does make the room cooler, it also makes it more humid.|Negative
Good purchase , does the job we wanted . Easy to order, pickup and install .|Positive
I really like It. No to noise. It cools very good.|Positive
Seems to have some flaws in the fabric, but it fits. Just what we needed to replace the old one we had.|Positive
"Following directions for best cooling is a plus. Best cooler we've owned. Works well in Wyoming in low humidity. Easy to set-up and operate. Great hints on ""New Air"" website."|Positive
The house stays much warmer now.|Positive
I FILLED The cooler with ice water and it still blew out hot air or the same as room temp 110 F|Negative
I would have given this unit 5 stars if it wernt for the poor build quality. This unit works great. Quite and very cool. But, the build quality is in question. My unit has balance problems and it sounds like someone next door building something and hammering. It comes every 20 seconds and lasts a few seconds and repeats. This never stops and it will drive you crazy. I cant have it on at night because it keeps everyone awake. Now I have to play the long game of trying to get someone to take responsibility for the poor build quality and allow me to get replacement parts and try to balance the unit myself. Without the proper equipment (balance gauge and so forth) I will need to get replacement parts and hope they were built better. Only had in installed a week. New unit shipped with a problem installed. I will update this review as the game plays itself out.|Negative
Old cooler pump was having a hard time starting up. This replacement works fine and was easy to install.|Positive
At best it only dropped the temp about 1 degree. It was more of a glorified fan than anything else. I think the instructions are reversed on the amount of water to ice ratio. Had to turn it on medium or high in a small den room to really have any chance of working and that does not go well with trying to hear the TV.|Negative
Powerful evaporator for size...two great features: 1) extra larger water tank and 2) ability to remove top half of tank to clean. Just take unit out of the box, add water and it's ready to use.|Positive
It was not efficient for an area of about 250 square feet. The house had gotten far too hot to be of any value for our comfort. Even put ice cubes in the water.|Negative
I purchased this evaporative cooler for my greenhouse, where the temperature has been soaring to 120°F+ in the afternoons (and it's not even summer yet.) With this unit set to medium, I can keep the temp around 85°-95°F. This is working as well as I was hoping it would!|Positive
I received the NewAir AF-310 Tower Evaporative Cooler within three days of ordering with delivery free-of-charge. The enclosed instruction booklet was easy to understand. The product functioned flawlessly and now I can look forward to a summer with my personal cool breeze. The evaporative feature reminds me of marine air on a northern beach. Excellent purchase.|Positive
They are just as good as Master Cool in fit and work just as good . I will buy them when ever I need them .|Positive
I have respect for Whirlpool, but this 155 CFM air cooler is very sad. First off, you see how tall and thin it is, that means that the cooling pad itself is very small, just big enough to cool your face and nothing else. Those louvers are motorized and they move slow. If you turn the thing off and then turn it on later, you have to reset the louvers with the motors, and that takes time, and I didn't find any memory, You have to reset both the horizontal and vertical louvers. There is a remote for that so at least you could sit in a chair and spend the time using the remote. There is no place to fill the water, you have to slide out the whole water pan, with the pump mechanism moving up and out of the way at the same time. The wheels are so tiny it won't roll over anything other than a perfectly flat hard floor. And don't try to lift it over a carpeted area because the lifting handle is at the top BACK of the thing, and that will dump water over the front of the water pan. This is one of those products that was obviously designed on the computer with someone's imagination that never actually intended to try it out themselves. If you are serious about a portable swamp cooler, get this one https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hessaire-1-300-CFM-2-Speed-Portable-Evaporative-Cooler-Swamp-Cooler-for-500-sq-ft-MC18M/304078769|Negative
The replacement filters fit perfectly|Positive
This is used as a high volume humidifier in the very dry air that exists this time of year and it works well as such. This purchase replaces an equivalent model purchased about 8 years ago that finally broke down beyond the ability to be able to repair it.|Positive
These work the best of any other material/kind of pads on my Champion WC44 swamp cooler!|Positive
A little larger size would be ideal. But overall I like it.|Positive
This swamp cooler works really well. Blows lots of cool air and holds a lot of water.|Positive
It’s performing as I expected|Positive
This pad works as it should .|Positive
This thing is simply ridiculous. Took a 6k sq ft building in Sparks Nevada (in mid July) from 90-95 degrees to a consistent 72-77 degrees throughout the day. From unbearable to unreal in a short time. Brilliant product. Extremely well made. All heavy duty. Built to last. Very very happy.|Positive
I installed this to a window unit. Used a step bit to cut a hole in the side of the unit, wired 14-3 and 14-2 thru conduit to the controller. Done. Works like a champ, no more turning it on and off by hand, no more freezing at night, the house temperature is regulated.|Positive
Used for my cooler to replace a defective device. Product was much better that the replaced piece.|Positive
Simply easy to tie over the turbine - easy to remove as well - great material|Positive
does the job and it's quiet.|Positive
Bought this for my husband for an outdoor tent-like setting here in central Texas. He reports that it works pretty well, even in our extreme heat and humidity.|Positive
Easy to install. Loved that it had an adjustable bracket--great idea since our cooler is 18 years old and not quite the same size as the newer ones. It started right up and it works like a charm.|Positive
I cannot rate this product on performance because I installed it in the winter and have not actually used it yet which is why I only rated it average. but I can tell you it is a well made piece of equipment and I expect it will perform well|Negative
Works as expected|Positive
This rigid cooler media absorbs water very well and matches demensions on box. Replacement is fairly simipLe and would only take about 30 minutes to replace except you need to plan on much more time to clean and service other cooler parts ie pumps and reservoir while you have pads out. The pad is very fragile and can be easily damaged during installation. Check box for damage also.|Positive
You'll be lucky to get a year out of these. Requires replacing every year. Cheap China junk.|Negative
The product itself did not work sufficiently at first but after troubleshooting for about an hour it decided to finally work correctly. Unfortunately, it just works as well as a cooling tower which is fine, but was hoping for something better. May work better in a different region but in Texas not so well|Negative
So far it has kept the small area cool. will review later if anything changes|Positive
Unit is very flimsy and cheaply constructed. The side panels should be constructed out heavier gauge metal since they are removed frequently for cleaning and accessing the motor and internal components.|Negative
It has been really hot and we don't have air-conditioning in our bedrooms. My daughter has a small room and this model works perfectly in her room.|Positive
Works great!|Positive
"This cooler works good but was different then the cooler it replaced.The old cooler mounted inside the roof jack while this one went over it so it took some modification of the jack to fit it on . Also while the water connection was in the right place the electrical hookup was on the opposite corner from the water and the other side from the old one so I had to move the hookup on the cooler to the to the correct corner so the existing power supply would reach. I needed water and power on the same side. My son and I did get it installed and it""s working as expected, but it did take considerable more time and work to do so. My advise is to make certain of existing mounting requirements and requirements of any new units if you want a less painful install."|Positive
Don't know how well these will hold up, Will know better by April of 2015 when I remove them and the cover.|Positive
I bought this swamp cooler 2+ years ago and I loved it. It just bit the dust, and since it's not under warranty anymore, I have to buy a new one. It cooled my home with ease and I didn't have to constantly fill the water tank. The only downfall is the plug that you have to turn to drain it, should be made of metal. It strips easily. If you get this unit, think about buying an extra plug right away if possible. You will need it after a while. Also, I'm not sure how long these are supposed to last, but mine just bit the dust after 2+ years. Won't buy different cooler, I loved this one too much.|Positive
I want to start by saying that I am not a person that does well in the heat. I often suffer from heat induced migraines so keeping cool during the summer is a priority. Another priority of mine just happens to be living on a budget and when you are constantly running your central air, that priority can be useless since costs associated with running central air is insane! That is why I gave this evaporative cooler a shot. I figured for being under $200 what could go wrong? Well, over the last few weeks I have been quite impressed. It is portable, filters the air (which is great since my family has asthma), it's not loud during operation, and it does it's job of cooling the areas in my home where my family and I spend most of our time. I have also noticed that my electricity bill hasn't skyrocketed even on days we are in the 100+ degrees and I have this unit running all day. Overall, I am quite impressed with this little unit and cannot wait to see how well it preforms as we near the hottest months of the summer. The only downside was the instructions. They were not very clear or easy to understand about assembly. However, I have spoken to the company and they are in the process of remaking them. Disclosure: I received this product for free or at a discount to conduct this review. The opinions expressed remain my own.|Positive
We order this tower cooler through ebay. When is was delivered we put it to use right away, it is convenient, easy to operate and very portable. Basicly put the water in, plug the power cord and turn on, it worded fantastic, keeping the room 10 degrees cooler that the ambient temperature,. Sadly with all the great style, awesome convenience, the water pump went out after two weeks. Thinking it was because it was an ebay, purchase though new, maybe it had a defect. So I ordered a new water pump from NEW air directly. Installed it and once again I had a great cooler. Sadly the pump went out after a month. so it was not ebay, it has been NEWAir own product...I was going to buy their portable air conditioner, but the company has not proved their worth in loyalty|Negative
I should have read other reviews first, when you install this your house will smell like urine for several weeks ... terrible odor from this manufacturer. Also, the true size was not correct and off about an inch (too big), this created installation issues.|Negative
Good quality great price, this portable swamp cooler cooled a large room with temps in the 90s.|Positive
Our home is 1400 Sq ft. This beauty has exceeded our expectations for the heat relief this summer. I highly recommend it.|Positive
I used Brian's Canvas for an AC cover, to keep the rain, leaves, and dirt out during the winter. The cover has Velcro on one corner that opens from the top down for the electrical and copper piping to enclose the unit. It's a quality canvas that should last for years.|Positive
Comes in large box, no signs of shipping damage, get it home, top is dented in, front left bottom corner dented in. Blower crooked and wobbles. I had already pulled my old unit out and needed this unit bad so instead or returning I took it apart, straightened the metal, moved some braces to straighten the blower. After all that, it is a decent unit. Fan is fairly quiet. I like the controller. you can have the fan come on up to 12 hours delay, like at 4:00 AM to blow in cool air. The 2 speed motor is nice, and it also has a second pump to pump the water out for winter. Side doors come off easy for service. Overall after I got over my initial disappointment and got it installed. It is a good cooler. Just check yours before you take it home.|Negative
I'am COOL !|Positive
I did buy this evaporator as a support to my AC unit. I have a 1000sft whare house and my ac unit was pretty small for the size of the warehouse. Now with the evaporator i am getting 75F inside and here in florida the temperature outside is 99f today. My recomendation is if you are planing to use this unit in a high humidity level areas like south Florida use a portable ac to remove the humidity because when the air is satured with water the cooler does not works properly. 5 stars great unit!|Positive
Received my Artic Cove 500 on June 7, 2014. It was very easy to setup, guide for assembly is easy to follow. In no time I had it running and work very well. I live in Arizona and it is something in an apartment or homesomeone would use a lot the whole year. I recommended highly. Thank you, dmickdog from arizona|Positive
The cooler very good l like this product|Positive
Water started leaking on the floor the day after purchasing and there was a smoky smell. It barely cooled at all. Will be returning.|Negative
It is just perfect.|Positive
Goooooood|Positive
Quiet. Works great.|Positive
Fit great and shipping was spot on.|Positive
No lip or boot for side vent makeup. Tubing to water pump cut too short. Wrong color wire in tie in bundle for wiring instructions, no brown/grey, 2 blacks. Flimsy metal side panal corners easily bent when installing. Panel drain tray slits not opened enough, dry spots on pads.|Negative
I have only had the fan operational for about a week, but it is working out great. I bought it for my son's room that tends to be very warm in the summer. So far, the fan seems to be working out great, he really enjoys the nature feature, and the cooling feature really does aid in cooling down the room. We live just south of Denver, so our climate is very dry and the moisture is welcome in his room. I am optimistic that this fan will be a great addition in helping keeping a rather warm room comfortable this summer.|Positive
I have used ice cubes along with the water and it does not really cool even a small area.|Negative
Purchased in May pump went out in August cant find replacement parts don't waste your money|Negative
It didn't come with a filter. The local Home Depot didn't carry the filters. It was missing the drain plug & I didn't notice it so water went all over the floor the very first day|Negative
It works, easy install, satisfied with results and would purchase again|Positive
This helped to reduce airflow from outside and reduced heating loss indoors|Positive
This unit was missing parts, set screw on motor adjustment and electrical cover, lucky for me the old rust bucket we pulled from the roof had parts we swapped out. Also the squirrel cage is a bit off balance making for a lovely NOISY unit.|Negative
I really like the aspen pads tried the green fiber pads in this a/c didn't cool well couldn't find this size in store so I ordered them|Positive
Bought this to replace one I bought in the spring that had become difficult to shut off. As it turns out, the stem screw that holds the washer in place had come loose. I checked the new one, and the screw was very loose. Check the washer screw tightness if you buy one.|Negative
Nice to know this available in the off season.|Positive
Had a small issue with my fan and the customer service team is attentive and willing to help.|Negative
I was very shocked to open up this new cooler I purchased, I just replaced a 20 yr old one sale cooler same maker and same cabinet size, the fit and finish on this cooler is cheap and no matter how much I maintenance I give this cooler it is not going to last more than maybe 6 years which is a far cry from the 20+ years I got off the same cooler from before. The guts of the cooler are good and you get everything except the motor which makes change out easy . Im just leary of how this cooler felt out of the box and the weight of it, the old cooler weighed twice as much as the new one so what does that tell you. Ive installed every safety device such as an annode rod, clean machine and painted the water troughs, just not sure how this cooler will last.|Negative
said it would fit the model I cooler i bought, it does not. yet another home depot screw up|Negative
I've used only the fan, not the cooler function, but it's an excellent fan. Because of the design it is more effective than just a small table fan, and because it rolls you can direct it where you need it at the time. Also the fan seems more powerful than other fans I've used, so even without the cooler it's really helping during this heat wave we've been having. The controls are easy to understand and I had no problem figuring them out. Because this fan was given to me without the cooling pad, I haven't used the cooling function, but will be able to soon, and that will be even better. Very happy with this item.|Positive
Mostly this just made the room humid... sad to say it wasn't what we had hoped.|Negative
It really cools off the room quickly and in fact can become cold at the highest setting. The water level is a little hard to see and wish it came with a some kind of stand to raise it higher off the floor so the water level can be seen easier. It certainly does the job.|Positive
worked good, but did not fit my need.|Positive
It cost a little more than I believe it should! I believe they should reduce the price a little. It was about a 1/4 more this year then last year!!|Positive
I have owed for a few months now. It is as described Not a A/C unit. Good size and does put out good air flow. Does not seem to help much on hot 100 degree days but well on overcast cloudy days. I have a 100 square foot room and bought bigger unit for the 200 square ft room thinking a little bigger would be better, I was wrong. Even though there is a ice compartment on top it does hold much ice and doesnt seem to help get water cool for very long. I started putting ice directly inside the unit from the side door which works best but still not for long periods of time due to ice melt of course. I usually keep pitchers of cold water in fridge and add ice directly when in use. I also use other stand fans to help circulate air flow. The unit does have to be cleaned once week or water will tend to drip onto floor. I recommend taking full back panel off to get inside to do a deep clean. There is no way to clean the fan blades and if dust is a factor have fun. I also recommend buying another filter or a back up since the filter doesnt hold up well. All in all works well enough for not being a A/C unit and if you like cold air buy a A/C unit. If money is a factor this is ok enough just needs maintenance and much attention to keeping clean.|Negative
This is basically just a replacement, though we (I) decided to use this brand this time. I appreciate HD having them available. But I already have others of this Champion brand that do a really good job. The only thing I don't understand is that in this day and age, the pan is not made of plastic, or coated. I had to buy three new coolers for this summer, all of which had rusted out pans. Can't we do something about rust, without having to jump to a whole different level of equipment?|Negative
Unfortunately, I chose NOT to accept them - because they were like others that I had before - that were not OEM....... Breezaire (my evapaporative cooler) has the rigid media that is shown exactly in your picture and description - but what arrived does NOT have the horizontal cap at the top, which helps disperse water to the sides of the pad! Instead, the media was a continuous vertical honeycomb of the cellulose media. If you do get the replacement pads that are shown in the picture - there are 3 families that have the same Breezaire as mine in my cul de sac and would be very interested in purchasing!Thanks!|Negative
I needed a replacement cooler for one of my two smaller cooler units (different brand) which had many rust problems. My biggest problem, with this unit, was finding a way to install it, as the front of this unit had to stick inside of my window and not just sit outside of the window, like my previous unit did. Because of the weight of this unit, when loaded with water, I need a sturdy table to set it on and I found it and ordered it from Home Depot. Once I had the unit properly set up, I hooked it up to water and turned it on. The fan part of the unit takes so much start up power that my lights and my TV all dim when turning it on. I have only used the unit, so far, on the slower fan speed but this setting puts out enough air to close my front door on the other side of my house. I have not had the need to use my other cooler as this unit is quite capable of handling my 1400 sq. foot house all by itself. I like the quality and sturdiness of the unit and I do not expect as many rust problems as I had with my previous cooler units.|Positive
I just love this machine. I got it for my chicken coop and it works so amazing and cools the coop down great. I am ordering another one for my patio. I like mostly like the fact that it can be hooked up to a hose and you dont have to worry about filling it up.|Positive
Good pump, does what it suppose to. I hope it will last.|Positive
Very well put together and smooth running product. I like that everything you need, except the motor is included.|Positive
From what I read online, this unit wasn’t highly recommended for the Midwest where we live, but we are extremely happy with it in using it on our porch. We really wanted to be able to enjoy the outdoors without air conditioning & this unit was just the thing!|Positive
I have had to wrap lightweight rope around the the middle and bottom of the cover because in my high wind area, the covers blew off. Even with the supplied gather as tight as I could get it, the wind would get underneath, inflate the cover, and eventually work it off the turbine.|Negative
Fits great. Should do the job well.|Positive
This item is cheap junk that never actually cooled anything even with ice in the tank. More like a glorified fan then anything. After a few months of owning the fan burnt out leaving me with with an oversized water pump to dispose of. Do not purchase! Look elsewhere if you want to be cool during summer months.|Negative
LOOKS GOOD, WENT TOGETHER EASY, AND WAS EASY TO SETUP TO HOSE FOR CONSTANT FILL. VERY POOR SHIPPING, AND POOR CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION.|Positive
A very powerful fan, and a useful amount of cooling indoors with cross ventilation during a too hot Oregon summer. Mine leaked a little at the front/back seam. I resolved that with a little window putty. A good value.|Positive
Really great unit.Moves a lot of air.Definitely great at humidity <45%. Effective to varying degrees above that. Not dependent on this model but for all evaporative coolers.|Positive
Works well, I use it in my garage but unit needs a larger water tank. Needs to be refilled often.|Positive
well built...no problems..|Positive
I bought two of these portable devices. I had hoped they would cool in back bedrooms at night. Really wasn't much better than a fan. Minimum cooling. I returned them. They look great and it's a great idea. Just not cool enough for central CA.|Negative
"This is a good product, but it has a few quirks that users should be aware of. First of all, if you run it outside in hot weather with the fan setting on ""high"" you'll need to make sure the water reservoir is filled because it uses a lot of water in these conditions. A gallon of water will only last you about 20 minutes. You can expect much better results if the fan is on a lower setting. The air is actually cooler with a lower fan setting. I live in Palm Desert, and during the summer there is no such thing as ""cold water"" coming out of my home faucet. The cold water tap produces warm water. If you have similar conditions, drop some ice in your filler bucket and then add it to the cooler. You'll have better results. Remember; ""cold water in, cold air out."""|Positive
Doesnt work very well. Better off getting a fan|Negative
Needed it today, Home Depot had 4 of them on the shelf at a fair price. Bought one installed it in less than a hour. Works just like is is suppose too. Couldn't be happier, thanks Home Depot.|Positive
this cooler was missing screws and had some screws misaligned. The cage was misaligned on the right side and two screws were missing.|Negative
The unit works, but it struggled cooling down just the area in front of it. Maybe it's not for our area where the relative humidity is very low (low desert, heat in the 100-110) I know of people that live in slightly cooler areas where this unit works great for them. Keep that in mind when considering this unit. I would have kept it if it would have worked better where we live.|Negative
It doesn’t get cold enough|Negative
Works great! Replaced supposedly new and better washable pads that could not keep house cool.|Positive
"If you've got a swap cooler you have (or will have) hard water build up in the ""spider"" legs. You can replace the ""spider, or remove it and then soak it in vinegar all day to clean the tube OR you can use this dandy little snake thingy to clean those tubes in just minutes! Wind it into a leg (wet or dry) swizzle and slowly extract. Repeat for each leg and you are back in business with 100% water flow restored to those pads :)"|Positive
For some reason, these cooler tstats seem to have a very short life expectancy. This is my third in three years, and I'm hoping this model will outperform the other brands. It installed easily, but took several temperature read setups before it got the ambient temp reading right. So far, it functions as expected, and I like the pre-wet feature for the pads, something the previous tstats did not have. It has been operational for only a month with no issues other than the the automatic mode does not work with the low-fan setting. But since it cost about a third of the previous models, I won't fault it for this non-feature.|Positive
I've had this fan for about a month now in the Phoenix area. So far, it has worked amazingly well in this dry climate. With the outside air at about 90 degrees and 20% humidity, the fan will cool the air to about 63 degrees (measured by digital thermometer). My wife made me move the fan so it wasn't blowing air on her because it was making her too cold, even on low. This cooler has no problem cooling my 2 car garage (9ft ceilings). It did a good job of cooling the bottom floor of my 2400sqft house (1200sqft on 1st floor). I ran it in the evening hours and it cooled the house from 78 degrees to 73 degrees in about 30-40 minutes. After almost three hours it was down to 71 degrees. You do need ventilation to prevent humidity build up. Overall quality is pretty nice and it seems to be built fairly well. The plastic isn't very thick but it feels pretty durable. My only complaint with the quality is that the hose adapter leaks (drips from an area other than where the hose connects). A few bucks at Home Depot should buy a better replacement. There's not a huge difference between high and low fan. It's noticeable but a bigger difference would be nice. The fan moves a ton of air. On high, I can feel the air movement from over 20ft away. The water tank is fairly large (14.6 gallons) but in Phoenix's dry air, the tank only lasts 2-3 hours between fills if the hose isn't connected. If the hose is connected, a float in the tank keeps the tank about 3/4 full at all times. I noticed that if the paper media is dry and you start the water and the fan at the same time, the media won't become fully saturated with water. To remedy that, I usually turn on the water drip first and let the media soak for a few minutes before turning on the fan. This made a 2-3 degree difference in how cool the air was coming out. The oscillation feature is pretty nice too. Vanes within the fan rotate and direct the air in varying directions. You can stop the vanes anywhere you want so the air doesn't have to be blowing straight out of the fan. The vanes are very effective in moving the direction of the air flow. Negatives: -I wish the cord was longer -I wish the tank lasted longer -I wish the pump shut off when the water ran out (could burn out pump if you don't?) Overall, it's an awesome evaporative cooler. Much more bang for the buck over other brands. Home Depot had a stellar price on this model when I bought it...almost $100 cheaper than the closest competitor. If you're in doubt...just but it. It's worth the money!|Positive
this cooler is grate.cooling the house down|Positive
Installed easy hardest part was removing the old one.|Positive
For what I used these for they work just fine, So keep them lube up and they will work just fine.|Positive
A very smooth and good looking product, does its job, bring the temp down 10 to 12 degrees if used carefully.|Positive
I live in a small Apartment (upstairs) and this was supposed to cool down at least my living room area (250 sq ft) as what the fan says it could do. it was only 79 outside so with upstairs apartments it gets a bit warmer and our thermo said 84 ..but no work. i put 3 packs of ice in the water too.|Negative
Aspen is the only pad I will buy. I went the cheapo route a few times, but had disastrous results. I had to go back up on the roof to replace the cheap ones. Try that on a 110 degree day in the Arizona desert. No, I will stick with Aspen. No surprises from them. Best quality, great prices.|Positive
Goog product overall.|Positive
This pump replaces the purge or media pump for MasterCool MCP44E. Last year it was the electronics that failed and with a 3 gang box 2 light switches and a dimmer switch attached to the window sill and a little rewiring, a little electrical knowledge and successfully rewired and bypassed the electronics that failed. This year the pump failed, and this pump is a perfect replacement, don’t forget to purchase the fiberglass mesh filter, less than $1|Positive
This works fine for a small living room. The price was great.|Positive
"""Plug and play"" right out of the box. Virtually identical to the original equipment pump that has lasted for 18 years. The plug, two hoses and two screws for the bracket (it also aligned with the original holes) made this an easy half hour job. I just wished they had at least one 230 volt pump at the store. Teaches me to check out the cooler a week or two before the hot weather. Has been working perfectly since I put it in last month and I would expect it to last at least a decade or so."|Positive
Unit is heavy and mounting brackets not strong enough. Pump did not operate without without detaching hose to prime. Float not set, needed to be adjusted to work.|Negative
Great value|Positive
This is a bit on the large side for my compressor unit but it seems to work ok. There are adequate tie-down options that make adopting to a smaller unit easy.|Positive
Very nicely designed, i love the wheels - easier to move from my home office to bedroom. I like the look of the remote and the ease of use, the humidifier feature is great for those who live in drier climates like myself (AZ) you can hear the water circulate but it's like an aquarium so it's great background/white noise. I like that it's low energy, I think that's a great selling point - turn off the AC or keep it lower and still stay cool when you work! See my video to see it in action.|Positive
The cooler was a great pick-up and it more than met our expectations.|Positive
I ordered the cover to be delivered to the store. It came on time and actually fit the cooler when I installed it. I am highly satisfied.|Positive
This is quite a nice cooler! It works very well and holds a large amount of water, so you can leave it on quite a while before it runs out. There are just two issues that I don't care for, 1 major, 1 minor. I bought this to use at home for my pets while I'm at work. It has an 8 hr digital timer and I had hoped that that meant I could set it to come on at a certain time and run until I got home. This is not the case. The timer only allows you to set the cooler to SHUT OFF after so many hours. I also can't use it plugged in to another timer because it's electronic. When you plug it in, you still need to turn it on by hand. This cooler could also be a concern if the power shuts off. When the power comes back on, the cooler will not turn itself back on. This worries me. I'm usually gone about 10 hours a day and one filling of the tank won't last that long, so the timer is a must. For the price, I expected a bit more. Now, I'm running this one during the day along with a second, smaller cooler on a timer to start in the afternoon. Also, I've been using it for just over 3 weeks and the water gauge stopped working. This isn't a major issue being that you can easily slip your hand in to feel once the water level is high. Aside from these 2 issues, it really does work well. I probably will replace it with something that's not electronic in the near future, just due to the possibility of loosing cooling after a power outage. If you're going to use it while you are at home, I highly recommend this cooler! If you need something to cool while you're gone, I'd look for something else.|Positive
Unit works great for helping to cool a large workshop in 110+ degree heat.moves a good amount of air. Great unit for the price.|Positive
The belt is the exact length that was described, after install and adjustment it runs very quiet and i think will give good service life.|Positive
Good to find a replacement when i needed it|Positive
Bought 1 and it worked so well, I bought another.Both have tears in the plastic case at the middle center.Would have returned the first unit based on the damageexcept that it did not appear to impact performance andit has been hot (111) lately.Second unit was delivered with the same problem.|Positive
Keeps a 500 sq. ft. apartment nice and cool even on hot days. Just make sure you allow for ventilation as it can get humid. In love with this cooler.|Positive
The Champion Evaporative Cooler seems to function well, but quality of construction is just average. I have used it for two weeks (mostly in just the evenings), and it rattles a little, but it drops the outside air temperature by 15-18 degrees.|Positive
Good product|Positive
Have not really had a chance on how well it works. It hasn't rain my purchase. It fits well though.|Positive
just what I needed|Positive
this is just a wonderful cooler. but we noticed on our black sofa which is next to the cooler that it would have small dirt like particles after the cooler was turned on. We found that just rinsing the cooler pads was not enough, we took a small air filter and taped it to the back side of the front panel. now it keeps all the dirt out! works great. We live in the high desert and dirt and wind are a real problem. this cured that problem. I love this cooler.|Positive
A great way to reduce the temperature in a given space- would give it 5 stars if it was a bit more quiet.|Positive
After living in an arid climate with HOT summers for several years without any sort of air conditioning, this has been a wonderful addition to my home. It works perfectly and cools as promised. It's not small, but easy to move around on its (lockable) casters and is also easy to use. Water system works well, but is not required for operation if I just want to use the fan function. The fan is pleasant and powerful - it's not super-quiet but does not buzz or rattle. Louvers are both vertical and horizontal and fully adjustable.|Positive
good|Positive
We love the Hessaire. I loved buying my fourth one on sale. Good product so far. Porta-Cool will have to regroup to beat the size and speed of fan and water tank size|Positive
Operated normally for a season, but the following year it only worked a few times, now it just beeps when set to cool mode, even with the tank full of water.|Negative
"In actual functioning, this has fair effectiveness, but a few problems cause me to not recommend it. The pump, as usual, functions separately from the fan. About half the time, for no reason I can understand, the pump has to be turned on by the remote control separately from the main ""on"" switch. It's ""on"" is signaled by a tiny faint blue light, and I have to climb up on a chair right in front of the cooler to see if it is on or off, and then mess with the buttons on the remote, which doesn't work very well, squinting into the light of the window trying to detect whether the blue light is appearing or not. The same faint blue light signals the ""hi"" ""medium"" or ""low"" of the fan. The fan is very loud. When I use the remote to change the velocity of the fan, there is a several second delay, while I wait to see whether the remote worked. The light appears (faint, tiny) very briefly when the connection is received from the remote, and the sound changes. When I look at the cooler to see, ""Man, that is really loud; what speed is it set on?"" I can't tell which speed it is, I have to manually change the settings via remote and listen for the quietest setting, which is tedious since the remote doesn't work very well. I have had no problems with water or electrical, but it isn't a smooth operating cooler, and the poor quality of the remote in the first couple of months of use does not bode well. The window is rather high in my wall, and manual operation is not practical. Supposedly this can be installed in a sliding window, but there is no accordian space filler to allow for that. No gasket or other provision is offered to seal out bugs from the gaps all around the console. I'm sure a lot of people have sliders, not single-hung windows, in their homes; don't know why the manufacturer would not provide for easy installation in a slider. This cooler in no way can cool 1600 square feet. The roar of the fan on the high setting would preclude anyone trying to use it for that purpose. I literally cannot hear my spouse talking next to me in the same room when it's on high. On Low, it will cool my 300 sq. ft. bedroom reasonably. The huge advantage of this cooler is its plastic housing, so we don't have to watch it disintegrate in rust beginning in the first year."|Negative
Great product i would recommend to anyone looking for a good product at a good price.|Positive
my house is 1250 sq.ft. with one bedroom door closed, it does not cool my back bedroom or back bathroom,325 sq. ft of the total of 1250 sq.ft.. this was suppose to cool 1600 sq ft. very disappointed.|Negative
When it was working it worked well and kept things cool. Pump stopped working after 30 days, and the filter picked up lot of odors - needed weekly maintenance, water replacement and deodorizing.|Negative
Simple and easy to install works great|Positive
the unit had a lot of airflow but could not cool a 200 sf room by more than 6 degrees.|Negative
works well would reccomend it|Positive
very good unit would recommend it.|Positive
This didn't come close to cooling my 800 Sq Ft home. The actual cooling area is probably closer to 400 Sq Ft. The unit is actually well made, just over rated in capacity.|Negative
Good quality cover.|Positive
I liked this so much I bought 2. The water tank holds plenty of water and the fan puts out a lot of air. It has an oscillation feature that is nice and ion feature as well. It cools my space well enough. My living room kitchen and dining room are open space a bit larger than the quoted 300 sq ft but it does well for the space directly in front of it and would do better in an enclosed room. Easy to move. You do need to have air movement to have cooling, so a window has to be cracked behind it and in front of it. It's not an a/c unit so don't expect to have ice cool air. It cools the air enough to be comfortable.|Positive
made from canvas like material beats the plastic ones I was purchasing for 3.00 less|Positive
I returned the product because i received another one as a gift. But it is an excellent cooler. The only problem is that you have to purchase the motor to start using it.|Positive
This cooler is much different than old school. The biggest change is a continuious water bleeder that is about 1 gallons per hour or so. what is that? simple. to keep fresh cold water supply to the machine to enhance coldness and less build up in water sump. overall you will stay cooler. I connected a standard (standard hose ready) water hose to the water bleeder and put it in the garden. How Happy is that? I like The Slim design over old school big box. It does not spit water at any speed.|Positive
While it goes through water fairly quickly, it does a great job cooling down an area!|Positive
The Honeywell 63Pt.Indoor Portable Evaporative Air Cooler is like a high power fan that blows cool air. It is not a air conditioner so, dont expect it to blow cold air. It does bring the room temp down but it's very loud highest setting. The ice tray is small & uses alot of ice. To me it's better than a regular fan but,not as good as a ac. You also have to fill it with alot of water like 7 1/2 pitchers of water. I was able to run it for 12hours before the water tank was empty & i had to refill it with 7 1/2 pitchers of water. You have to take the back panel off to clean the filter it has alot of screws which are deeply embedded in these smalls holes, you will need a long & short philips screwdriver for all the screws, & you also have to drain the tank & clean any build up once a week.The cooler is large & heavy so if u a lady & dont have upper body strength it would be to much for you to handle. If i could have a ac in my unit i would buy a ac instead of this cooler its to many things you need to do to maintain it. But, yes it does blow cool air just doesn't cool off the whole room. My room is the size of a single apt. I only felt the cool air if i had it blowing directly toward me. The rest of my room felt hot & humid until i sat or laid down in front of the cooler then it was ok. Again its not a air conditioner. & you must have a window open in the room when you use the cooler or your room will feel like a hot indoor pool, hot & humid. 1. Ac 2. Evaporative Cooler 3. Fan. If you can afford a ac & a little higher bill , go with a ac instead this cooler, just make sure its a energy star product that way your bill wont be that high.|Negative
This is an excellent evaporative cooler that has none of the short-comings of the older metal coolers.|Positive
Reallly just a super expensive personal fan. Has to be in your face to do any good. Might as well just buy a $10 fan.|Negative
Great unit, works just as expected|Positive
The item fit perfect and am very pleased.|Positive
It has to have an outside air source to cool down a room, and it is still not as efficient at it as my old (broken) evaporative cooler that is in the wall. It has good fan power, and I really like how convenient it is to roll it into different locations.|Negative
Seems a bit spendy but, it makes you money when you can stand in front of it and get your work done. It makes your work area very comfortable. Does not cool whole building. Just your work space; say 10x15 feet or so. Definitely makes a 100 degree shop bearable enough to be comfortable. I won't live without one again.|Positive
We live about 45 miles northwest of San Antonio, TX not exactly the Arizona desert. Our summer days are typically in the mid to upper nineties with dew points in the mid-sixties. Was very doubtful this unit would make sitting on our outside patio any less unpleasant than it already is. Unboxing and assembly was easy so we had it going in about 10-15 minutes. When I turned the unit on I let the pump saturate the pads for a few minutes and then kicked on the fan. WOW what a difference! The outside temperature was 96 and the dew point as 65. The temp of the air coming out of the unit was 76-77 degrees. Needless to say I am very impressed with this evaporative cooler. I purchased the 5300 CMF unit which covers the area around our 6 place patio table very well on low speed with the oscillating louvers. As you might expect the noise level goes up as the speed is increased. Low is fine, medium is OK but high is loud. It really moves the air. This unit will make sitting outside, BBQ, dinning and working on my car enjoyable during the hot summer months.|Positive
there is no bearing, it is a bushing.|Negative
It's OK as a replacement for old grille. Like other products these day, CHEAP. Bet it didn't cost 3$ to make!|Positive
It is easy to set up and use. If you need extra cooling to help out your air conditioner on those extra hot days this is the way to go.|Positive
Did not fit my Cooler.|Negative
"This is a 15k pump to be used with 3/4"" tubing. I overclocked a 5k CFM cooler with it. You will need a 3/4"" to 1/2"" reducer because the smaller coolers all use 1/2"" tubing. It really performs great. A super heavy-duty pump getting you the extra water circulation you need for those warmer days."|Positive
Simple to use and light in weight. Just what I needed for my living situation.|Positive
The new pads always smell so bad. Takes weeks for the odor to dissipate.|Negative
The pulley was easy to install and gave me the speed I was looking for. Thanks Jim|Positive
They need to hire some quality control inspectors or torque assembly tools...It always comes from the top down, the construction implies Champion has sloppy management. It will be fine and do the job but craftsmanship might be better from overseas. Lots of screws stripped out, lots of nuts not tight with extras inside that must have been dropped and the fit on the filter holders is poor....I have the blood blisters to prove it. Maybe Champion needs to see about overseas fabrication! The electrical knock out service entrance is using worn out dies so the knock out is just a print in the steel, finally had to drill out the center of the access first. It will work OK after all it's just a wet box, nice powder coating, but I would not want them making my new car.. Summary; Poorly assembled, bad quality control, worn out dies in fabrication but it is only a wet box and I'm sure it will work OK. Is pride showing, not at all... Mine was still on the factory shipping pallet and container, I suggest not buying if it's been removed and moved around...|Positive
The media filter does give off a terrible odor, but I must admit this unit does as designed and will cool down the area it is used in (even on the lowest setting). A word of warning, this unit is very big and very noisy, I was planning to use this indoors to cool my living room but it is just too noisy. I ended up returning the product for the smaller 800 CFM unit.|Positive
It took longer to get to Home Depot and back home than to install the new switch. Very easy repair.|Positive
June 13, 2018 purchased this unit and it was working well in our small office space. On June 20th we took the unit back to Home Depot for a full refund for the following reason: The cooler would only run on the lowest fan speed. We tried to turn off the cooler thinking it may just need to reset due to a possible glitch and the unit wouldn't turn off. Unplugged and plugged back in it continued to do the same thing. Home Depot gave us a full refund and we purchased a different unit.|Negative
Price was good and fit according to expectations and specifications noted.|Positive
REALLY LOUD! We live in the mountains of Colorado, so don't need air conditioning, but it seems like there are more and more days the house gets into the high 80's and is so uncomfortable. We purchased this yesterday. It's going back tomorrow. Works like a charm and the room is really cool (91 outside and 78 inside), but it sounds like an airplane is coming in for landing, even on the lowest speed. Extremely easy to set up and use. Fill it with a hose (it's on wheels so you can move it to a door to make that easier), plug it in and turn it on. I'm really bummed and will look to see if there is another that works as well but is more quiet.|Negative
Fits well and works fine.|Positive
works great, we use it outdoors on a screened patio, love the remote and the timer feature, easy to fill and move.|Positive
This cooler is just what we needed to bring relief from unbearable heat in a small (but not tiny) two-room apartment. It is easy to move around and after shopping quite a bit, we found this to be an amazingly good value. We would absolutely buy it again.|Positive
This is the 2nd one we've ordered in 3 years and are happy with the fit!|Positive
This is a nice cooler. I like the three direction front face. I like that it quieter than most coolers. Like any evap. cooler it keeps our home cool as long as the temperature outside is 95 or below.|Positive
Quiet good humidifier too; 3 months; yes. meets expectations.|Positive
This was exactly what we needed - 3 sides, fits great.|Positive
I had to order it from Home Depot because they didn't have it in the store, but it arrived earlier than the expected date so that was just fine. I installed it myself in a second floor window (not easy to do and not recommended if you haven't done it before). But I had 4 other guys help me lift it up, etc, and we were able to successfully install it. If you already have the hookups for an evaporative cooler, then installing this one really isn't that hard. It just takes being smart and not doing anything stupid that would cause it to fall (it's pretty heavy and big!). After I installed it I found that it cooled my house down MUCH faster than a portable 500 sqft air conditioner we had in the house before. The vents on the front are nice because you can move them from side to side. The panels on the outside are really easy to take on and off. There are three panels total, and although I haven't had to do it yet, I can tell that replacing the filters every spring should be pretty easy. One thing I like about this evaporative cooler is that it seems like it is going to be pretty easy to clean. The inside is pretty wide open and you can probably spray it out with a hose when it gets dirty (just make sure to cover up the motor, but it's near the top so it wouldn't be difficult to keep dry). Highly recommended. All of the parts inside seem like they're solid and I think this will last a long time.|Positive
Must nicer than external coverings. Easier than cutting a piece of bead insulation|Positive
I've always had a good experience using Honeywell products and their quality, performance and functionality are impressive. My new Honeywell 830cfm 2-speed indoor/outdoor portable evaporative cooler works great and I'd definitely recommend it to use indoors to cool up to 460sf, or it can be used outdoors to cool off the patio, deck, grill area, etc. The two speed fan motor is strong and really pushed some air. It can be manually filled or can be hooked up with a continuous water supply-garden hose. It can be run in the fan mode or cooling mode. The remote control works great and I like the optional mode to have the fan louvers move back and forth. It has wheels for easy moving and a nice space saving design. The instruction manual is very complete and easy to follow. I definitely recommend tis great Honeywell evaporative cooler!|Positive
Very noisey fan is way to loud. And put a thermometer in front of it and did not get below 80 degreescold. I returned it and purchased the big metal box swamp cooler and it works twice as good and freezing cold 68 degrees and i live in palm springs California in the desert|Negative
Fit perfectly on my attic fan motor.|Positive
We used this for a different application ... To control the flow of the water to our fountain. Didn't work.|Negative
Yes, I feel that the product I bought for my cooler was a great fit and very satisfied.|Positive
This replaced a Convair that was 17 years old. This is just amazing. A lot of the time just fan does the trick but to cool down in a hurry, low will do it. Haven't had it on high yet, not summer yet either.|Positive
It is sitting on my back porch and keeping us nice and cool during the hot long summer days|Positive
OEM replacement pads fit perfect in my Durango Cooler!|Positive
Works great, looks good in the house, could not be more satisfied.|Positive
not cool enough for second story AZ bedroom. .|Negative
This unit is one of the best I have had keeps room cool, after about an hour I can turn the pump off and just let the fan run. The room is 250 sq feet and I live in Las Vegas. If it get to warm I just turn the pump back and for another hour and it cools it down in minutes. I highly recommend this product.|Positive
I do not regret buying it, but do not expect air conditioner performance. Like any small evaporative cooler it works best in a dry environment where additional humidity is desired as much as a bit off cooling.|Positive
It works great and nice to have , put the air right where you want it|Positive
Great product|Positive
Fits nicely. Would have been nicer if rope or ties were included. Lots of wind in our area. The product itself is good. Hope it lasts longer than one season.|Positive
We live 2 peaks and in the same county as Death Valley CA. Our swamp cooler musr run a slightly high water rate to keep our 1780sq. ft. home cool. This water pump is quiet, fast to start pumping to the spider and soak the pads. Well worth the money and my family is cool.|Positive
Easy install and it cranks out the cool air. Very satisfied so far. Hopefully it will last for years.|Positive
Easy to use and cools quickly|Positive
"Th best word to describe it is""Excellent""."|Positive
This cooler pump worked as advertised. It was easy to install and I had no problems with it. The price was right and I would buy another if I needed one.|Positive
Great product. I would recommend this to all my friends thank you|Positive
The turbine covers arrived quickly and were easy to put up. They seem to be working fine.|Positive
It sure fit good much better than the old canvas ones I used to use. Now need to wait to see how many years it will last|Positive
Didn't cool the small room at all even with water and ice in the tray. Water also leaked from tray. Returned it the next day.|Negative
fits perfect.|Positive
This is the required pump. Unable to describe features. price above avg.|Positive
Rather expensive for cooler pads! However, they do work!|Positive
Worked very good used it in my garage kept it very comfortable|Positive
The Bonaire Durango 4500 CFM evaporative cooler is better quality than Master Cool's similar unit and has thicker evaporative pads. The axial fan is quiet and efficient and the cooling is remarkable for a low profile cooler. The only downside is the inefficient water bleed-off system and the lack of space inside the unit for a purge pump to reduce water consumption. All in all a great cooler and well worth the money.|Positive
Everything you need to connect a standard hose bib to a swamp cooler in one easy to install package. Only thing you may want to get is some clamps to attach the tubing to the house depending on your installation. I just used some U clamps for securing cable TV and those worked great.|Positive
I bought this swamp cooler close to a decade ago. The fact that it is only now requiring a new pump is a miracle in itself. I was worried it would require cutting/stripping wires, and disassembling the whole thing to get at the pump's electronics, but as it turns out it was only a half a dozen screws, AND it was plug and play. This only took me a half hour. GREAT DESIGN. Well made. I love this thing.|Positive
I put them on plus I put new pulleys and new belt tested it out. Now I'm waiting on a heat wave. THEY WORK GREAT|Positive
Maybe we are expecting too much; but, on a very hot day had to be directly in front and close to feel any cooling. Certainly not 950 s.f. Will try again when temps get lower. Loud|Negative
I buy several if original belt and pully’s are missing. The belts work well and for many years. Adjustment is key to properly working motor.|Positive
"My office is next to the laundry in the basement of a hotel. It gets unbearably hot and humid. I fill this thing up with ice and water and I am cool as cucumber all day long! I especially love the fact the whole unit doesn't oscillate, it is the blades on the vent that ""swing"". All of the people on my team are going to be purchasing one of these units for their offices!"|Positive
We own 2 portacool units, one for the shop and the other for outside events. We love it! Highly recommend this unit.|Positive
This is the second Champion 4000 series cooler I have purchased in the last two years. The first one (a down draft unit) works so well I went straight the HD website and ordered a side draft unit for an exterior wall I needed to have a cooler mounted on. With the proper two-speed motor correctly mounted on it you will stay cool an calm all day long! .”|Positive
Fits well and serves it’s purpose.|Positive
Great product for keeping that cold air out, easy to install.|Positive
This was the worst evaporative cooler I've ever seen. We are in Idaho and we have low humidity so we thought it would work fine. Instead, it seemed to make things hotter and everything just felt wet. We tried it with ice and no difference. We tried it in multiple rooms; upstairs bedroom that's always hotter than the rest of the house, a downstairs bedroom, and the kitchen. It performed terribly in each room. We returned it and got a portable AC unit instead. Don't waste your money on this product.|Negative
As expected. Fast in-store delivery too.|Positive
NOT SUITABLE IN ARIZONA EITHER, DEW POINT AND HUMIDITY MATCHES THE EAST COAST BEFORE SUMMER !|Negative
failed after 2 weeks.|Negative
We live where the humidity is very low so thought we'd give a swamp cooler a try inside our home. Don't need air conditioning but maybe a few weeks in the summer. But on those few days, WOW, this cooler was great. Cooled the air in the living, dining, and kitchen in just a few minutes and on days when we don't need the pump on, we use it as a fan if the house feels a little warm. We keep it on low most of the time as medium and high will blow you away. Great product.|Positive
Cooler pads were well made and work great with my homemade cooler fan|Positive
Not very cooling as stated.|Negative
The NewAir Portable Cooler works very well in the Colorado summer climate. It has a large capacity tank that lasts a long time and the fan speed is very efficient, cools a room nicely. The wheels make it very easy to move from room to room. I'm saving a lot on my electric and water bill by using this portable unit instead of the large house sswamp cooler cooling rooms that weren't being used. Overall very pleased with the NewAir cooler!|Positive
This cooler was picked up at the store, where I inspected it and found it to be complete and intact. Installation was well within my DIY capabilities. It as functioned perfectly in the month it has been in service.|Positive
WORKS GOOD,SHOULD HAVE GOT THIS YEARS AGO|Positive
Cooler is fine but the 2 speed cooler motor purchased from HD when operating has an electrical magnetic whine (hi and low speed) that can be heard above the normal fan airflow noise|Positive
I was tired on dreading my electricity bill every month and decided to do something different this summer. I ordered this online on Friday night and had it in my window by the next Friday. Home Depot delivered it in less than a week. We are cool and not worrying about what the electricity bill will be. It cools over 2000 square foot house easily. It was easy for my son and me to install ourselves. Highly recommend this product!!!!|Positive
Received pads with a hole in side of box and one of the side pads had a hole in it. The large pad was not glued very well and was in three pieces.|Negative
Works much better with shredded aspen fill (6-8 degrees cooler) rather than the bargain-basement cardboard fill provided. You'll need a bit of ingenuity to change. I used double thickness aspen pads, 1/2X1/2 steel mesh, and electrical tie wraps to keep pads in place (tend to sag when wet). Keeps 350 sq. ft. workshop at 76 when outside temp is 100+.|Positive
Excellent machine!!! Already have recommended it to a friend!|Positive
the pump was really easy to install and once it was plugged has worked great.|Positive
High quality belt I do a lot of repair and price is important but quality is a must you will get both.|Positive
perfect for a small area,love it|Positive
unit's pump quit. troubleshot and found ground signal to control water pump inoperative. Something went out on control board. Also found that you must drain regularly or flush with vinegar to prevent internals from caking up (I'm using softened water). I guess you could use distilled water, but the cooler uses a lot of water, so it would be expensive. fan blade is not well balanced causing the cooler to vibrate|Negative
Great product at a great price|Positive
Doesn't cool as much as I hoped but does a good job|Positive
This Champion cooler was what is needed to cool an older 700 sq/ft mobile home located in southern part of NEW MEXICO, hopefully with proper maintenace the unit will last for 10 years. The only complaint I have is there was no bleed off for the water distribution system and no cover for the inside face of the unit. Both of these are now EXTRA COST items now. The bleed off is very important as the water is very alkaline and must be bleed off every time the unit is used.|Positive
It’s loud but it does the job|Negative
Great fit. Fast shipping! Good job guys!!!!|Positive
This promised to cool 250 sq ft. It did not -- I first used it in my kitchen area, which has two open doorways. I didn't expect it to work much more than a good fan in that area. However, when I moved it into my bedroom and closed the door, it was just about the same. I used the 2 ice packs that came with the unit, added more ice, and cold water, so it certainly wasn't that. In addition, it is not very quiet. I took it back the next day.|Negative
Product is great works great except for the remote never worked from day one. As stated the unit is great but the installation instructions are not clear at all. Installing took some general contractor know how to get it in securely. I recommend the product but higher a contractor to do the install.|Negative
Purchased this unit to cool a small bedroom. It was easy to assemble and its functions all worked. However it absolutley did not cool the room. It moved little to no air. I wouldn't even recommend it as a fan. We tried the tips others had posted online, such as adding frozen bottles of water to the water tank etc... nothing worked. You have to adjust the water volume the unit moves to very slow. If you adjust to a level where it moves the water at a rate that would seem to aid in the cooling effect, it leaks water out of the side of the unit. If you do purchase this unit consider placing a pan underneath it to catch the water that leaks out to avoid damage to your flooring and or carpets. We are returning the unit to our local store. Don't waist your time or money on this unit.|Negative
Of the 5 portable coolers I have used, this one is the best. It has large air intake & output surfaces along with an easy to fill high capacity water tank. My cooler sits on a TV turntable that allows easy access to the back of the unit & to other areas to be directly cooled.|Positive
"Installed cooler pump in less than 10 min. it was so easy and I've been ""cool"" sailing! ever since."|Positive
The pump was easy to install and works perfectly for our swamp cooler|Positive
Working very good so far . I love it|Positive
This big bulky cooler has an impressive size and is thus far disappointing After spending six hours cutting a hole for this big thing into my wall and installing it, I find that it's fan even though a 1/8th horse power like my other swamp coolers by a different manufacturer, runs without the power that my others do. I have swamp coolers that drop the room temperature easily 20 degrees and reach across the room, unfortunately no one carries these anymore, and I had to buy this untried and reviewed one. I'm not impressed. If you are looking for modest cooling, that is somewhat quiet, then this will work although it's front end is so big it won't easily fit many windows today and will require cutting through a beam in a wall if that is the way you go. Also, I find the compression pieces a hassle in general, they leak from the start and as pressure is built up on the compression piece by the shutoff valve inside, they spay all over the place. Now I have a big hole in my wall made specifically for this big thing and I will likely return it.|Negative
works fine|Positive
This cooler works well in my greenhouse---cools well, and has a big reservoir. The problem is that the hose connection leaks enough that I have to manually fill the reservoir rather than leave the hose connected for auto-fill. Big inconvenience!|Positive
The build/assembly quality is not very good. The bottom pan has a dent and doesn't sit flat. It is hard to tell when the unit is level, because there isn't a flat panel on it anywhere. I can't figure out what costs so much on this unit. That said, it has operated without any problems so far.|Negative
Absolutely as advertised! Works great!|Positive
Did not work received defective , no quality control ?|Negative
Bought it for my Garage. Living in Arizona all my life, it does get warm. :) The reason for the Garage cooler is to help me stay cool cleaning up my car collection. The right size with Great cooling!!!|Positive
Worked great|Positive
Unit appears to work as described except the noise it makes while the oscillating feature is turned on. The unit makes a loud screeching noise that sounds like rubber rubbing on plastic as the fins move back and forth,|Negative
Space was under the 250 sq feet Just did not cool the air under 5 degrees from outside Used the ice packs and it didn't make any difference returned the product|Negative
This cooler works excellent for me. I agree 100% with Dave, who wrote a previous review. You really have to know your coolers and how they work and the enviroment you are using them in. Like Dave, I live in Lakewood, Colorado where we mostly have a dry climate. After, rainstorms the humidity can get occasionally high, and in this case the evaporative physics does not work well but, the humidity goes down fast afterwords. On hot days, however, these coolers work excellent. I've been using evaporative coolers for over 15 years. This cooler is quite an advancement over my previous ones. I live in a townhome with small (about 750 sq.ft.) and this cooler is perfect. I would recommend this to a friend who has a similar living enviroment.|Positive
It does its job.|Positive
Bought one of these for a Tucson area 2 car garage. After I ran it for 3 hours, the temperature in the garage did not change, but was overly humid. The output temperature was within 2 degrees of the garage air. The cooling pad is very small, I even tried cold water and added ice. Was shipped to home, returned it to Home Depot Store, no questions asked. Thank you Home Depot, I was dissatisfied with the product, not your great service.|Negative
"We live in Apple Valley in Southern California. I decided to purchase this cooler because of the positive reviews that were written. Our air conditioner had been running constantly with the temperatures being between 100-108 outside. Now, our house is kept a comfortable 75 degrees all day long, and we are running the unit on ""low"". We placed the unit just outside of our sliding glass patio door and opened the front door to allow equal ventilation. IT WORKS WONDERFULLY!!! We did have to adjust the float valve, you can do that by turning the thumbscrew on the side of the plastic water inlet that is installed on the unit. . Also, make sure that the water gauge float is not pushed up into the frame and moves freely up and down. It""s a GREAT INVESTMENT!!!, We are amazed at the cold air it produces!!!"|Positive
So far I am happy with the performance of the cooler. It works well in the garage.|Positive
GREAT BUY - EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS! It's more powerful & efficient than expected! Sleeker & lighter than expected! And much, much quieter than expected! We live & work in AZ in a 2400sf home. So far this year we barely needed to use our air conditioner at all despite temperatures already into the 90's! We run the cooler on low all day until we close up the house to go to bed at night. Through an open door to our backyard patio with the front door and various windows slightly open, it circulates cool, moist air nicely and keeps the majority of the house around 15-20 degrees lower than it is outside! The unit cost is more than reasonable and if this level of efficiency continues throughout our 110+ degree summer, it will more than pay for itself in just 1 year. I would highly recommend this evaporative cooler to anyone!|Positive
The belt Seems to run smooth and not make any unexpected rattles or noises.|Positive
Compact, attractive and wonderfully quiet. We keep cool and can hold a conversation simultaneously! Love it!|Positive
The Champion Cooler works very well. We had one before but it was getting old and we needed another. This one not only works better it is quieter and the remote is very handy.|Positive
easy to use, however it didn't fit as snug as I was hoping. overall it's a good investment|Positive
ok would be better if made of alm|Negative
If this unit can work here in Las Vegas at 114 degrees F, it will work anywhere..! Easy to use, I usually fill it half water and half Ice cubes, it then makes a much cooler breeze..!|Positive
The water bucket is difficult to remove when there's still water in it. I don't like to wait for the water to be gone before refilling, so I just pull it out enough to pour water into it. So that means 4 or 5 trips from the kitchen sink and back with a 2 qt. pitcher--anything larger and it's too hard to pour into the 3 inch opening I've made by pulling the bucket out a bit. The reason it's difficult to remove is that there's no way to retract the pump and it limits movement of the bucket. I've used this now through 2 summers and am starting on my 3rd. The fan is starting to rattle and it took 3 tries to get the unit's pump going this year. I'm shopping for a different model now.|Negative
Cools my 24x24x10 garage with wide open door very well. I run a gym in my garage and it held internal temps at 80° during a 102° day. Some noticable humidity when you aren’t in the direct stream at those temps but in the direct stream it was “chilly” according to sweaty people of course.|Positive
Very easy to install. No leaks. Worked like a charm|Positive
This unit is garbage, it didn't provide no cool air whatsoever.|Negative
Adequate water flow for my Master Cool Evapoative cooler. have had no issues with it since installed.|Positive
Haven’t installed this yet. But, like so many other contributors, mine came with a cracked plastic frame. Because it is so big and heavy, I decided not to return it, but just superglue it and use it.|Negative
Fit perfect. Nice draw string at the bottom and velcro opening for electrical and refrigeration lines.|Positive
It's very sturdy material. Fit my unit great! I ordered the size to allow for 5 inch elect. box on side. I may put a tie around the entire thing just so wind doesn't get under it and blow it off. Just an extra precaution as it does have ties in one corner and Velcro in same corner is heavy duty. The underneath is vinyl so I'm leery of putting it on over the summer if I'm gone, with the 115 degree heat we can reach - afraid it might melt onto the unit. I will use cover in the winter for sure. Color is nice and appropriate for the color of our roof tiles. Won't know about how it wears until I actually use it but did put it on to see if it fit ok. Like the way it looks also.|Positive
The pump motor was fine except it did not come with a filter screen. You can't get a replacement screen in the home depot because they don't sell them. The wires have to be connected to the switch and at least they have the same color coding as the original.|Positive
great fit, easy to install.|Positive
Working well at this time|Positive
I am pleased with this purchase. Not having used for a full season I can only speak of performance when new. It seems well made and I expect it to last for many seasons.|Positive
We use this cooler inside our house...it works great if you leave a few windows cracked open in the house...easy to roll around...easy to operate. We set it up just outside the door of the room we want to cool down. That way the moisture from the back of the unit does not make the room to humid. We live in the dry southwest, so it works great for our needs...I don't think it would be good in a humid state. We would recommend it to someone who wants to cool down one room at a time...it will not do a whole house at one time. It is quiet on the low setting if you want to use it while having a conversation or at night when you sleep...the higher settings are a little harder to talk over, but not unbearable.|Positive
I recently purchased this along with my new swamp cooler (RWC50, SKU 424732). I was very disappointed with this leg kit, none of the screw holes lined up with anything on the actual cooler, I was forced to hammer the angle out of the leg kit to be able to mount it to the cooler. Then much to my disappointment the Leg kit covers over the water inlet/float assembly so that you are then forced to creatively enigineer a new way of attaching that assembly. If it wasn't for my own creative work + supplies + other tools (like a metal saw) this kit would have been completely useless. Save yourself the headaches I went thru. Don't get this.|Negative
It leaked a great deal and we had to return it.|Negative
The temperature drop is only 4-5 degrees. Greatly increases the humidity. In it's defense, this is a moist time of year and humidity is already pretty high. Waiting for the change in weather conditions and hoping it will operate better and drop temperatures more. Overall with the high blower speed it makes it more comfortable and I would recommend it.|Positive
great fit|Positive
I was only expect this fan to be able to lower the inside temperature of the house 10 degrees compare to outside temp. during those very hot day of 95 or more and it really works, fan is powerful and not that loud, blades oscillate side to side to move hot stale air out of every corner of my house with a combined area of about 1900 sf, on a 97 degrees day outside, it was able to bring inside temp. down to 82 degrees, has to say the moisture will make you feel wet and muggy but if you happen to stay in front of the blowing fan for 10 min. you may feel shriveling, without water in the reservoir it is so light to move around easily. Be aware that anything light lying around will be blown away.|Positive
I used it for my swimming pool and it is working great.|Positive
I purchase this product because it says that it'll cool a room. My room is small. I put water in it and even then the room felt hot. It blows air for sure, but not cool enough air to make a room cool. I certainly don't recommend this product. Unless you want hot air blowing at your face.|Negative
Pump is quiet and keeps the pads wet all day long with fan at full blast. Keeps our family cool.|Positive
I purchased this product and was easy to install, thought it was great until it wasn't. It only lasted for 13+months and only used about 30 percent of that time.|Negative
It failed after one week|Negative
I bought this for my 6000 sq ft Shop and while it doesn't cool the whole shop, it can cool an area pretty good. The fan really moves some air, so I usually run on low or med speed.|Positive
Great filter for my mastercool swamp cooler.|Positive
Cover was just fine, did the job.|Positive
Installed easily.|Positive
This device is not worth its value. I even tied putting in ice cold water and it would still not cool my 300sq ft room. I live in So. California, so this is probably something you don't want to go with if you live in a humid state. Thumbs down!|Negative
The unit is well built, the panels fit well but are not difficult to remove. I don't know what gauge metal it is made of but it is not flimsy. The unit came with everything necessary to replace an existing unit except the motor and legs (package includes pump. float, drain and pads). I had a motor but I bought the leg kit for $30.00 and they also seem to be well built and sturdy. It took about an hour and a half to get the unit on the roof and hooked up and to adjust the motor amperage . When I fired up the unit I was impressed how much more air it moved compared to the old tired unit it replaced....probably should have replaced the old one a few years ago. Will install an anode and an inline water filter in a few days to slow the salt deposits which is a cooler's biggest enemy.|Positive
Pump was easy to order and delivery was quick. Pump is working fine, hope it lasts a while.|Positive
Installation was fairly easy but had to make an additional trip to the store for water line and connectors that were not included in the installation package.|Positive
Helping cool down our warehouse|Positive
Easy to assemble works really good|Positive
Excellent product|Positive
"I purchased this cooler, even after reading reviews. I should have listened! The product worked GREAT... 4 times. After using it those 4 times, the pump quit working and consistently read ""low water"" even when the unit was just filled. Don't get me wrong, it cooled very nicely when it did work, but honestly? 4 times and I'm left with a $261 fan? No thanks."|Negative
This works fine to cool a single room (an office with a PC generating heat) but you need to know how evaporative cooling works:1. You need to live in a dry area2. The cooler needs to intake fresh dry air, either from a window or a door3. You can only lower the temp by 10-15F with this cooler|Positive
It's perfect for any room!|Positive
This evaporative cooler is amazing! We no longer are at each other's throats because we are so hot. Easy to use. And Hessair who makes this is very helpful should you need assistance.|Positive
This evaporative cooler exceeded my expectations. It works great. You can feel the difference immediately! The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the noise factor. I'm not sure it's any louder than a window a/c and it's certainly quieter than a smaller unit we purchased for upstairs... but it interferes with conversation and the television.|Positive
this cover is well made and can withstand the elements. It installs easily and with the strong lacing it snugs up tightly. The vent in the top really helps when the wind blows. The cover doesn't blow up like a balloon, allowing for less wear and tear.. It is a great buy and with an added strapping system will stay secure even in the worst of storms.|Positive
Works well to cool our sun room. We also use it to cool bedroom at night.|Positive
We'd read quite a few negative reviews about this cooler but decided to try it cuz we were desperate. So far it's working really well, actually puts out more cool air than any other cooler of its type we've owned and we've owned several different makes. We own two of these coolers now and the one we purchased from Home Depot is performing better. The other one constantly has to have the float adjusted which involves taking the back off, and the water level indicators on both coolers stick, very cheaply made, but the fact that they cool better than any cooler we've had before makes it worth the inconvenience. As stated before, the coolers are cheaply made and since this is our first year with them we have no idea how long they'll last but we can say we don't think they're built for longevity. We would recommend this cooler with disclaimers.|Positive
This item does exactly what it was made for...cooled down my mother's room by 10 degrees...it was much needed during these hot times in the desert. Highly recommend it if trying to cool down 1 room.|Positive
Fit perfect. Was and easy part off part on. Works great. Glad we tried the fix ourselves|Positive
I only ordered 1 product and it came missing pieces. It is a cooler vent with 8 louvers, (2 on each side) and 2 of them were missing. I had to drive it back to Home Depot to get my money back and then order it online again.|Negative
I live in a desert climate and loved this cooler. I keep it in my master bedroom and use the ice packs it comes with on especially hot days. It adds a nice amount of moisture to the air and works efficiently. We often bring it into our family room and use it during movie night to keep the whole family cool on hot summer evenings. The remote makes it especially handy in a bedroom for night time air.|Positive
Not bad - but not great ... it broke within 5 days.... sigh... and its going back today for a refund. Also I noticed that the water outlet valve is placed closer to the screw-in threads than the original plastic one that came off my mastercool ASA51 - I have a plastic liner so the placement of the water hole is important, this valve's water hole is running water onto the liner, and I just went through a big song and dance with water getting behind the liner I needed the water hole farther away from the liner. Also the break was on the float arm, it snapped at the connection pin. But I have a friend who has one as has no problems. I upgraded to the heavy duty $14 float valve.|Negative
Save yourself the money and buy quality first. Works perfect, no smell no problems. Be certain to remove and clean the water distribution shelf before reassembly. New clips to secure pads are included.|Positive
Received it damaged twice but customer service did refund my money|Negative
Awesome product, works great in the shop,|Positive
The cover fit perfectly; it is worth measuring carefully before ordering. The only negative is the yellow coating on the canvas. It rubs off and transfers to everything.|Positive
Very easy to install. Seems to work as well as original filters for a little less cost. Hot tip directly from Bonaire....If you have hard water, to keep mineral build up at bay, occasionally sprayvinegar directly into the filters thru the slots of the outside cover.|Positive
Needed about termite table saw and I was having a hard finding time finding one found this swamp cooler belt and it was just what I needed|Positive
We bought this to cool our 1800 sq. ft. home instead of our broken 1970's AC unit, and it has been a huge success. Construction is simple, robust, and durable. The only downside it took two people handy with tools 3 hours to securely install in a ground level window. The accordion shades for covering the sides of the window left exposed are not good for sealing of the window after the install is complete, but that was easily rectified by purchasing some blue insulation board, painting it, cutting it, and caulking it into the window side holes.|Positive
I hope it will do the job I got it for, it hasn't been in long enough to tell.|Positive
All this unit does is turn hot fry air into hot humid air. I don't know why they make these.|Negative
Both my boys are happy with the performance of these.|Positive
Having to fill bags of ice and water every night is not sustainable. I do not recommend this item.|Negative
I only started the unit to make sure it runs but I haven't run the entire system yet. water to see if it cools the air. Will try soon.|Negative
I purchased this brand new at HD and the pump worked, but as soon as I turned on the fan, the pump stopped, the fan slowly started and then the fan stopped. Then it started again and after a few seconds it stopped again. I checked the tension on the belt and it was fine. Also the voltage is fine. those are the troublshooting steps. Called the manufacturer and they said that they would send me a new controller unit but it would take 5-7 days. Meanwhile it's 100 deg F and that may not fix it. Home depot was no good. Can't send someone out. I can return it, but I had to rent a trailer to get it to my house in the first place and get 4 guys to put it in place.|Negative
Swamp cooler seems to be made ok, had problems with side panels going in, had to bend and flex cooler to get it square. The pulley that comes with unit isn’t worth installing just throw it in the weeds and get a good quality pulley, and the fan isn’t very straight, besides that it worked fine.|Negative
received in a time;y manner. fit was as described. was very easy to put on,and looks nice. thank you for a wonderful product. ken|Positive
Easy to install. Runs great , cools most of the house. Only thing, seen a bit of rust starting on the inside of pan after running for a month. I can fix it this winter. Got my sister two for her house and they work great.|Positive
Very simple wire up. Easy and simple to use. Easy read dial, setup in minutes.|Positive
Does the job on Low~! 1250 s.f. house|Positive
It's what I ordered. It fits perfectly and the measurements were correct. I won't be able to give it an accurate review for several years until I've seen how long it lasts.|Positive
"This cooler works great for what I had in mind - taking some of the heat out of a west-facing garage. Two things that are somewhat disappointing: The rate of water consumption is high. I manually fill it twice a day and am considering buying a 1/2"" hose to fit the fill spout. Also, there were no indications on the website ad that this cooler required a source of fresh air. First time I've purchased one and thought it could be operated in a closed environment. Nonetheless, this produces cool air, has several adjustable controls and does the trick."|Positive
Fit like a glove.|Positive
The cooling is non existent. It's noisy. If you use swing the base of the fan makes additional sounds. My front swing plastic broke after a few days. Stay away.|Negative
The evaporator was easy to unpack, assemble, fill, and use. The manual is easy to understand and has great tips for maintenance and storage.|Positive
Works great, great price , very pleased|Positive
Fits perfectly, sturdy material my evaporative cooler is completely covered.|Positive
Picture Perfect comes immediately to mind. Fits well. Easy application. Sturdy material. I am completely satisfied with this product.|Positive
We are very pleased with the cooler. We use it on the deck.|Positive
We purchased this on sale for $127.00 online. Awesome cooling for the price! A few pros and cons. Pros: It does cool the room as stated. It has a LARGE water capacity (like 4 gallons!). Itdoes have a hose attachment for a constant trickle flow, like a swamp cooler! Cons: smells with first use it, the manual says it may have a slight smell when for a short time when first used... But what they don't tell you is that it smells like old urine and makes you sick (like hurt your stomach, and feel like you've drank too much ill) and takes a good day for the smell to dissipate! Also it's a louder unit, the fan is louder with each level and when it's hot you have to run it at least on 2 in order to feel it.|Positive
Great product,god cooling system|Positive
It was an easy installation. very happy with the unit. wish it had a thermostat. Is there a thermostat available for this unit?|Positive
I called the company in Santa Ana and spoke to James regarding an operational problem and question. I received a friendly response and upon discussion was offered another model that, instead of repairing, would optimize my experience with their product. I was quite surprised..customer satisfaction is alive and well . I would most certainly recommend this product based on what I have experienced..many thanks, again..|Positive
best purchase we could have made for our mobile home. my wife keeps turning it off because she is cold and thats in the summer time and in redding ca it can get into the 1000's quite often. the motor went out within a week. i took it out, went to home depoy and they replaced it without ant questions. great swamp cooler. thanks home depot|Positive
Perfect fit as always. Can't get through the summer without them.|Positive
Not working well|Negative
well made, fits well, looks like it will be durable. About all I can say at this point since I just got it.|Positive
Sturdy, adjustable, easy to work with. My cooler feels solidly mounted to my roof.|Positive
This product is awesome. We used it indoors and out. It can bring good relief on hundred degree days outside on the patio barbecues. Guests have been very impressed and bought one themselves. Does have a slight smell at first but goes away fast. Couldn't be happier with this cooler|Positive
This product was ready to use and when into operation as soon as it was out of the box and the wheels where installed. One thing is worth mentioning here. The compartment housing the wheels on the bottom of the unit has a cover which must be removed. When putting the cover back on, make sure to use the same small/short screw else you will make a leak into the water tank like I did. Easy to fix with PVC glue but not necessary:).|Positive
Looks to be much better than plastic covers. As it's not winter I haven't used it yet. Just being prepared.|Positive
Item was high quality and exactly what I wanted. Sales Rep was very helpful and product was delivered very quickly.|Positive
There was a lot more do it yourself than I expected. No controller lots of wiring to do. Luckily I had an electrician at Home Depot Grand Junction help me with the electrical. I NOW have a chance to get it working .|Negative
i live in phoenix so climate is perfect for evap cooling. It is 83 degrees on patio and humidity is around 15 percent. After running for I hour to insure pad is plenty wet I checked temp with two thermometer...76 degrees is what it puts out!!!!!!! A measly 6 degree drop!! I have done several tests similar to this and never get more then 8 degree drop...that was when the humidity was below 10%. Duiring the night in my room it would not drop temp even 1 degree.I had fresh air source and open window to vent humid air out....I am very familiar with evap cooling have it on my home and shop so I know what it is capable of.This unity doesnt even come close to cooling properly. On the plus side home depot will take it back at store with no cost to me! Oh, it is a decent looking unit with quiet fan etc. I think the paper thin pad is the problem with this unit. The air doesnt have time to loose heat over a pad a little thicker the tissue...|Negative
Great cooler, Only complaint is there is a separate switch for the cooler fan and water pump. Makes it easy to turn off the cooler and accidentally leave on the water pump on. also to turn on the cooler and forget to turn on the water pump and charge the house with hot air.|Positive
Good squirrel type fan, strong air movement but very limited cooling.|Negative
We have a 1700 sq. ft. shop and this unit has been... amazing! It was easy to install and we very much like the slim profile for the back of the building. It has done a great job at cooling the shop and really does produce an amazing air flow. Highly recommend.|Positive
product arrived on time. unpacking was easy no problems. works very well. however i did not receive wheels , i rechecked the package and could not discover the wheels. i would recommend this product to friend.hopefully i will get my wheels|Positive
This is a versatile, efficient monster of a cooler which will pleasantly surprise you. Its compact, movable, and packs a really powerful blast of cool air for its size!!! I have mine placed in front of the Living room window, with the front door open; keep in mind its over 90 degrees outside here in Reno, NV and its 76 degrees inside! WOW! This is A GREAT BUY AND SUPER VALUE and worth every penny. Yes its true, Its smells at first, I emptied it after running it about 4 hours and put new water in it and its already getting better. Don't forget to open windows on the other side of the house as dry air makes the evaporator part work better. Thank you HD and Hessaire!|Positive
Made the room hotter|Negative
the outside dimensions are larger than I expected but when you don't read the specs you can be surprised..... It really does cool a rather large dining/kitchen area that we have. I am glad I bought it. Instead of ice, I use frozen small soft drink bottles and it works great.|Positive
It would of gotten a 5 star rating but there was damage to the unit from shipping. But it didn't effect its operations|Positive
Cooler worked great for 3 weeks and then the water pump went out. Returned to local HD and received a refund with no problems and plan to order a replacement.|Negative
Works GREAT|Positive
It is doing the job, so i guess it is a good product.|Positive
It shoots air out but not cold air. I don't like it.|Negative
just had to install the caster wheels and fill with water does its job well|Positive
The product works as advertised, but the first time I bought two years ago it was $55.00, a year later $76.00, now $94.00.|Negative
I bought this to cool down the room that we use for my daughter’s nursery. Its a very small room that is not air conditioned. I do think this works very well, the air is cold and the fan is pretty powerful for what a small product it is!|Positive
Has a metal 'blade' style fan that sounds like an airplane...even on low speed. Get the master cool portable instead. Has squirell cage blower and is virtually silent.|Negative
I bought this ac unit yesterday. I put it together and was excited to finally have a cool room, but no. This thing is a piece of garbage. It smells, it's loud, and the drain plug doesn't plug anything. It leaked water continuously. It also made the room extremely humid and sticky. I am returning this product immediately. Don't waste your money.|Negative
Townhome is staying cooler than last summer! Awesome!!!|Positive
I've tried 3 diff models and this one performed much better at a more convenient price !!! room is chilly!|Positive
It only ran for 2 to 3 hours than it stop working and will not turn on again. I have to return it to home depot.|Negative
Let me start off that this unit cools great so much so it's been turned off a couple times during day by wife. Now the bad points. The unit was missing everything that is needed to assemble in the box. I mean everything screws for assembly, remote etc. I had to dig though my screw drawers in order to assemble then had to make mounting brackets. I've contacted company about the missing hardware and was told it'd be sent out- all I got was another louvre which I had in box, which was busted up from UPS. Personally for the money and what I actually got this really isn't worth the price. Now if it was less and they made it known that you'd have to be you own hardware store to make it work then it be worth it. This unit does a great job cooling and would be 5 stars had I had the hardware in box or had received the missing parts/remote when I reached out to them. Biggest for me on anything is customer service from a company and it's lacking here.|Negative
"The pump that is provided is ""original equipment"" and is difficult to replace when the pump has ""seized"". In order to remove the electrical plug the pump has to be dismantled and then the wire can be pulled through the cooler hole. Also the bracket holding the pump is a good idea but HOW DO YOU REMOVE IT FROM THE PUMP? So far not necessary but will have to figure it out for the future. Was able to wash off the salt deposit from the base of the cooler with no difficulty."|Positive
This cooler worked way better than I expected! Durable, easy to move around. I highly recommend this to anyone!|Positive
Worked just as expected. Quick and easy to swap out.|Positive
This small unit has provided amazing refreshing atmosphere in 100+ temps outside on our shade covered Patio, even at low speed settings 2 of 3 settings throws lots of air 20ft and more, the oscillating feature is very nice! Uses water quickly in dry Cali climate, yet an awesome buy!!|Positive
Cools the room just as advertised. Easy to handle and fill. Only thing I would change would be to make the level indicator easier to read.|Positive
"The cover itself is extremely well-made; very heavy duty. The only problem is that it doesn't ""breathe"". I bought it because this particular size is perfect to cover my extra 20lb LP tank which I store outside. I checked the tank the morning after a rainfall and discovered sweat all over the tank. Prior to this, the tank was covered with a cheap blue tarp purchased from a popular discount tool store. The tank stayed absolutely dry; no sweat. Like I said, this may not be the cover's fault. It just did not work for my particular application."|Positive
I love it!!! with temps at 112 in the desert south west I was inside nice and cool! With 3 speeds, plenty of power, and an oscillating fan I couldn't ask for more. Don't hesitate, buy it :-)|Positive
Doesn't cool at all when too hot outside.....just an expensive fan....the water tank for it started leaking after a month...don't waste your money...I had faith in this product and was greatly disappointed|Negative
My apartment does not have air conditioning in the bedroom and it is unbearable in summer. This evaporative cooler is perfect for this situation. Even my cat loves it.|Positive
We have hot water heat and consequently no air ducts for air conditioning. We priced having a contractor add whole house air conditioning and duct work to our house. The price was very high. So instead we have had several UltraCool coolers over the span of perhaps 10 years. All but one are still working great! We live in a fairly hot but very dry climate and being retired need to conserve both electricity and money. One of the reasons we like this model is the large water tank which we can fill once a day or every other day and live and sleep in comfort. The motor makes no more noise than a window air conditioner and we didn't need to harm our wood windows and molding to install it. We recently gave our daughter one of ours and will be going out tonight to purchase a new one to replace it.|Positive
I got this to cool my chicken coop when were expecting a crazy heat wave of 120+ degree temps for days. I've had it running 8-10 hours a day for about a month now, and it's still working well. It cools the chicken coop 20-30 degrees. It's actually pretty comfortable in there. Bonus: It has an auto fill float and hose attachment, so it doesn't run out of water. I don't think the product description shows or mentions that. Downsides: The fan is not quiet when it's on high, but it's fine outside. I've had to remove the filter once a week to clean hard water deposits off and clean out the reservoir.|Positive
It's a belt. Does what it's supposed to do. Looks to be good quality|Positive
This Swamp Cooler has made a huge difference in our Restaurant!|Positive
This cover fit well and seems to do the job. My only objection is that it arrived with a yellow powder covering which had a tendency to smear on anything it touches, but maybe the powder helps preserve the canvas.|Positive
This is a great cooler cover, and is oversized to fix. My cooler is exactly 42 x 45 and this fits easily.|Positive
Since I do not have central air, I've been mulling cooling options for a while. This unit cools all the communal rooms of my house without the high energy costs of an air conditioner. It is powerful and relatively quiet.|Positive
Works great Also better than my last set. Will always buy from you|Positive
Easy to put on. The tie down strings hall to lee the cover on. The string seemed light and could stand to be heavier. Will see how the product stands up to a few seasons of use.|Positive
I love the profile of this unit. It would stick out a little too far on the interior if installed exactly the way instructed so we supported it more on outside to give a lower profile inside. It came a little damage but replacement parts came right away. It works great and I love the three speeds.|Positive
Easy to use and install. Moves a large amount of water.|Positive
I just received mine and have it on my patio, and it dropped the temperature 15 degrees in just a few minutes!! I live in Yuma, Az and would highly recommend this cooler for anyone who likes spending time on the patio!!! Works perfect on our drier days!! Great product!!!!|Positive
I thought I needed a new motor in my swamp cooler. The wall next to the switch was getting hot I said that's not good. So I got a new switch and now the motor ramps right up. So much better and safer. I should have done that a long time ago.|Positive
No good for the investment of cooling a room|Negative
The cover fit perfectly and was heavy duty. The smell was not great but it will air out over time...|Positive
The company is using cheap or faulty bearings. It goes thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk... on low speed. Really annoying sound and it sounds like it will fall apart before 1 season is out.|Negative
It's doing the job.|Positive
Bought this as others have, to replace the old pump that had run its life course. This pump deffo brought my cooler back to life and once again cooling the house like it was new.|Positive
This is one of the best purchases I have ever made for my home. Living in the desert, the added moisture in the air makes the room much more comfortable. And I don't have to use it but a few hours a day. It can easily drop the temperature in just a few minutes, so I don't even turn it on till mid afternoon. The only complaint, is the auto fill valve for the water level. What they send is complete junk, made from plastic. I could not get it to work, so I went BACK to Home Depot and bought a brass one for about $8 that works perfectly. It really only saved them a couple of dollars by sending this junk valve. I would have rated this item five stars if not for all the trouble we had trying to get that to work.|Positive
They are only good for one year.|Negative
had unit installed and really like all of the features,ie remote control,3 speed fan,auto purge pump,filter media,uv resistant construction,and it looks better than the square swamp coolers,fan on low is relatively quite(about the same as when our air was on) and gives great air flow,ready to see how much less our elec will be this summer,|Positive
completely met all my needs at this time.....|Positive
This evaporative cooler is just what we needed to keep our one level home comfortable on a hot day! It is easy to use and was easy to install. The savings in electricity are great!! We are very pleased with our purchase!|Positive
draw string possibility of it coming off with wind|Negative
This product is great for cooling single rooms. It also adds humidity which is great because it helps relieve my allergies.|Positive
I have replaced it 3 times due to it breaking in less then 24 hours only low speed works very disapointing. On mild days it cools good but hotter days can't keep up with no high speed ever working otherwise would be|Negative
Failed after 24 hours. That means it overflowed the leveler|Negative
works great fits perfictly|Positive
Unit works well, I had to literally build my own duct work and skirting as non was offered by the store, Don't let the size and weight discourage you from installing yourself, if you're ambitious enough, you can completely disassemble it, take it up in pieces and reassemble in place on the roof. Cools well enough in a dry climate. Uses less than half as much power as my refrigerated air unit does. Thermostat works pretty well. Motor pulley is variable pitch type that allows adjusting the low and high speeds - good feature as with the original setting the blower was fairly loud. You can adjust for a good compromise between air flow and noise. If you can, I would recommend installing a side draft unit on a shady side of your house and venting it through your regular duct work. I did cut a hole in my ducting and vent some air from the cooler into the attic to cool/vent that space also.|Positive
prefect fit, now need pulley for blower 1 inch diameter center hole.|Positive
Tenant reports that it cools her apt fine.|Negative
Got unit installed and it made the last heat wave very managable. I should have done it a long time ago,|Positive
Works great. Had no problems with it|Positive
It does not get very cold|Negative
It is a bit noisier than I expected. But, it works very well, indeed! It easily drops the temperature in my greenhouse by at least 20 degrees, even on the hottest of days, thus creating the perfect environment for my orchids. It does tend to run out of water before the end of each day (on very hot days). So, you will want to have a hose handy to fill it, rather than lugging five gallons of water out to the greenhouse to fill it up.|Positive
It works just fine....for a few days. Then it quit working for good. I'm taking it back to the store tomorrow. It actually would be a good value and works just fine. Right up to the time it quits working forever.|Negative
The product fit my Mastercool C62 unit. My service technician said it was easy to install and included more rigid media than was required for this unit. Good alternative if you can't get the exact sizing for your unit.|Positive
Very pleased! Fits perfect and attached easily. Made from a very durable material that should last for many years. I highly recommend this product.|Positive
Met my expectations! It was delivered when promised.|Positive
worked fine and the cooler is up and running again.|Positive
I was early getting the cooler set up this year. the cooling block had the right size for my cooler. Looking for a cooler summer this year.|Positive
Everything about this cooler is great, except the weak pump. I live in an area that uses whole house coolers part of the year, so I am familiar with how they work.|Negative
Good evaporated cooler,i am outside using it in the hot Arizona weather with 113 degrees and as long as i have it in front of me it's great.|Positive
The hook up spout is too short, no extension was available to reach the spider hose, have to improvise with a two-hose extension and hose clips. Last one I got had LONG spout and reached just fine!|Negative
Great machine unfortunately too much moisture in the air where I live so I had to return the machine.|Positive
Worked great and kept living area cool while ac was out. Easy to fill|Positive
I thought I would give a try over the traditional water coolers I've used in the past. I opened the box just to see it cracked everywhere. Cheap plastic that will never hold up for long period of time. I took it back one hour after buying|Negative
Like that it's so much smaller than a traditional swamp cooler and can be mounted through a wall without a stand. Don't like how much humidity it puts out on all 3 fan speed settings and I live in Colorado where there is very little humidity. Every so often I just have to shut the pump off and let it run until it dries out the pads and takes some of the humidity out of the house. Also had issues with the install - it was spilling out water at a gallon every 3-4 minutes. Called Bonaire and they said it would decrease after flushing it 3 times with 10 hours between flushes. That's a lot of waisted water!!!!! Kept having the problem after doing the flushing. Ends up, the float was installed upside down by manufacturer. Tried adjusting it - broke it and had to buy a new one. But it has been working fine since. Noisier than expected.|Negative
Easy set up. Used it run off generator when power went off for 13 hrs in 100 degree heat in AZ.|Positive
This cover fit the cooler perfectly and will provide good protection during the winter months. Quality appeared to be excellent. Brian's Canvas makes quality products and I have used them previously for a custom boat cover.|Positive
I bought this evap cooler 2 weeks ago. I have it in my bedroom and it keeps it cool without turning down the air conditioner. I really like it. It does have a plasticy odor that stays longer than the 2-3 hours the directions say but I spray the room with an air freshener and it's ok. I will be using this for most of the summer and in AZ it gets HOT. I would recommend to anyone that needs to cool a room and want to save on their electric bills. I may buy another for the TV room.|Positive
Easy to install|Positive
It works the way its supposed to.|Positive
A little assembly not bad but does not come with the motor|Positive
For people asking about adding ice. It works by evaporation. Adding ice has no effect on the temperature at which the water evaporates, hence does no good. If anything. it would slow the initial cooling while the ice melts so it can evaporate.|Positive
would be better if it was rated for cubic feet. It is undersized for what I wanted to accomplish and I selected the next size bigger than my sq ft.|Negative
I’ve been using these cooler pumps for years on our I commercial evaporative coolers. They are excellent pumps.|Positive
Perfect fit! At a good price!|Positive
I don’t like it, is to humedad when the air is blowing,I putting in the open window & still humedad|Negative
it's priced right and it did work.|Positive
This is a replacement for previous cover, so this one has not been opened yet, and will not be until the end of summer. Presumably it is the same as one before. The biggest complaint is the color. I wish they came in more neutral colors. This (color) sticks out like a sore thumb.|Positive
Fit my Mastercool HC44 like a glove. Plenty of material. The slot at bottom to hold the media on the support. Different thickness of styrofoam to really wedge them in from the sides. Snug as a bug in a rug.|Positive
We have an older swamp cooler and needed this product ASAP. Home Depot delivered this with a good price.|Positive
Hi. For whatever reason the unit does not keep the area all that cool. Might there be something to help w this please?|Negative
good quality!|Positive
Spend $50 more for a window unit. Do not buy this thing. Pros: will cool you off if you are sitting in direct line within 10ft. Cons: Front wheels don't swivel and plastic cracks around casters causing leaks, pump clogs from crappy cardboard filter disintegrating and pieces fall into water tank, fan stops working on setting 2 and 3 after only one month Like I said above, hold out for a window unit, but don't buy it from here, they don't sell fan motors with units...|Negative
They are evaporative cooler pads. They fit without modification and work just fine.|Positive
This portable Swamp Cooler did what I expected. I live in Vallejo and it's always warm to hot there. It cooled the living during the afternoon heat. Very simple to get started. Instructions were easy to understand.|Positive
Yes thank you very much|Positive
I bought this cooler on line from Home Depot because I couldn't but it locally. It puts out 300 cfm's more than my old one which is great.|Positive
Works OK if you're in front of it.|Negative
Works great in my shop or outdoors. Can I get another one for the price I got the first one.|Positive
Wonderful unit - far superior to the model it replaced. (and worth the extra $600). Much quieter and the thermostat is great - slows the fan down when the set temperature is being reached - and speeds it up as needed. When temperature setting is met, unit turns off - just like a compressor style unit. Construction quality is good, and it is made in the USA with some imported components. <sigh> The plastic water tray and media housing will reduce the corrosion, and I hope will increae the life too. After the installation, I liked the lower profile - it is more difficult to see on the roof.|Positive
Wow... it is everything we had hoped for and more. Love the thermostat... keeps the temp perfect. Cools our home.. hasn't been above 78 here in Vegas. Our hottest temps to come but feeling confident for a much cooler summer.|Positive
I would not recommend this product because it doesn't cool that good.|Positive
I used this in my indoor garden, it worked great. This unit provides the right amount of cooling and humidity. i have used it for over a year now. the fan quit blowing side to side and I need a new air filter. It still works great. I suggest a 5 gallon homedepot bucket to fill it.|Positive
First one wobbles, taking it back. Maybe the second will be better. No quality control.|Negative
This unit was purchased to replace a similar 14 year old unit made I believe by Whispercool. I think this manufacturer (Brisa) also made the older cooler?? This unit is covers 400 square foot more than I need but purchased the bigger one to improve cooling the back of the house. The kitchen and living room get cold quickly and the rest of the house stays quite comfortable. From previous experience as long as the weather is not humid outside the unit will keep the inside between 15 and 20 degrees cooler than outside on very hot days and only increase electric bill $20 to $30 a month. If this one lasts as long as the first it will be well worth the price. Time will tell. Note this model was $115 cheaper than the same with a remote. I'm not that lazy yet ! Only improvement would be a thermostat or way to keep the front of the house from getting too cold.|Positive
Inexpensive, up to the job, in the sore. Aces.|Positive
Product fit perfect. Was same as my old set that were original. Extra pieces helped to make a perfect fit|Positive
I bought this cooler for my greenhouse during the summer months. It does help keep things cool as desired. Note: The switches were in spanish though. The product also came with a few dents. Also the grill flaps were individually [manually] adjustable. No thermostat or water hookup kit is included.|Positive
This is SMALL and doesn't cool like other indoor evap. coolers that I've used. It just doesn't cool down our living room like bigger ones. It has a very small reservoir that constantly needs filling and has a fan sensor that will switch the fan to low until the pad is wet but it also does it randomly throughout the day! So we took it back and I'm searching other reviews now for a replacement! Let ya know what we choose and how that one works!|Negative
worked perfectly.|Positive
It's just what I needed and fits perfectly. No hassle and easy to install. Very durable.|Positive
Finally a portable cooler than works. Well built and actually cools.|Positive
I purchased it to help cool the garage, but it only circulates air in a small space. Even put 10 lbs of ice in the tank and just a little cooler, but not enough to make it at all comfortable|Negative
the unit performs very well, and cools my Arizona garage and porch when need. I like the front fill area so I do not have to hook the hose on for short periods of time. great value|Positive
works well in the swamp cooler and is dependable. what more can i write!|Positive
I just got this a couple of weeks ago, but it's working great so far. Good unit at a good price.|Positive
These arrived promptly and were very easy to install. There was a bit of a chemical smell when I opened the packages, but that is to be expected with treated canvas. I have had a set of these for my mother's home before, and I was glad to be able to get them online as there were none in the store. Great product.|Positive
we love it it worked realy good for our BBQ|Positive
It's toooooo loud and you have to set closed to it.|Negative
The cooler works fine. I've noticed that the model number that comes on the cooler has been changed from 4001D to 4401DD. This might be a problem for anyone getting an energy incentive rebate through their utility company. I know that Rocky Mountain Power does not have the new model number listed on the approved cooler list yet.|Positive
The covers fit perfectly. Made of heavy canvas and very sturdy.|Positive
So far, so good. Cooling my house down as it should.|Positive
Setup was easy and the instructions had chart for transferring over the wires from the 6-position switch. Works like a champ.|Positive
The outside temperature is 95F, the humidity is 5%, and even when loaded up with ice and water, the unit blows lukewarm air. The pump works and the pad is wet. It just does't cool very much.|Negative
Great quality of material and fits perfect.|Positive
We love it! First of all, it's quiet and works very well to keep the temperature down to our comfort level. Economical to use compared to a A/C unit with a compressor. The volume of cool air it is capable of moving is amazing. We have had it for about a month now, using it regularly. A great addition to our home.|Positive
No assembly required. Hooked up to a garden hose you don’t have to worry about it running dry. I filled the top with ice and it definitely lowered the temperature of the air. Big improvement over the fan I had on the porch.|Positive
I have several of these units, and they work wonderful in AZ dry heat, It cools down the rooms they are in, and What little moister doesn't effect anything in your house, it works well with the A/C too, I love them and sleeping with it on is great and Not hard to use, Remote to quickly use as needed, very efficient and does what it says it will do, Tank is a little hard for a handy-cap person to clean out but I do mange to get it done. Filters are easy to wash out and keep clean, Best Cooler and Fan Available , Quite then most, I would be proud to spread the word on these units.|Positive
I bought this for a town house that I live in that has 6 skylights in the front room and 20' ceilings. Also it only has one window in the front and a door in the back room;so it is real hard to get any air in here. There is about 900 sq.ft. on the floor with the cooler plus the high ceilings. This was pretty easy to install and has a pretty good en closer that wont rust. Has the ridged cell media that is more efficient but will cost more to replace when needed. The only problem I really had with it was getting the cover back on at the top. I spent about an hour installing it so not to bad. I was looking at this at the store and seen how low profile it was and an associate told may about the rebate witch sold me. He was also nice enough to show me some pics of one he installed for his parents and said he was going to get one him self. This should pay for its self pretty fast as any window A/C would not have worked for us to many cu.ft. plus it cost less to run. I will also probably buy another for a different house that I rent out.|Positive
I live in Colorado and we needed something to help cool our upper floor master suite. This does a good job. It doesn't get as cold as an Air Conditioner but I knew that and didn't expect it to. It gives a nice feel to the room. My only complaint is that the instruction booklet does not explain the filters very well. It came with two extra filters but I have no idea what to do with them. I have emailed the company that makes NewAir and hopefully I will get a response. It isn't to loud and looks nice in the room. So far I am very happy with this unit.|Positive
It more than meets our expectations, it well exceeds them!|Positive
works great|Positive
The product came fully assembled and it is a great deal.|Positive
Was delivered on time and in excellent shape. Easy to order and easy to install.|Positive
Hold the swamp cooler on the roof and provides good support.|Positive
I have had the NewAir AF-1000 Series Evaporative Cooler and after a short 20 days of using the Unit in my 100 square foot bedroom started leaking water ruining my carpeting in my bedroom. I have NEVER filled the water tank more than 1/2 full but EVERYTIME I use the unit after about 2 hours of continuous use continue to find a large puddle of water underneath the unit. Obviously I know why the unit only carries a 30 day warranty. Not only has it cost me the price to purchase it but have dealt with the cost to replace the carpeting and padding in my bedroom due to water flood damage. Bottom line is if I ever recommended this Evaporative Cooler to a friend I wouldn't be a very good friend. Unfortunately I had to give the unit at least 1 star which it doen't deserve for me to be able to submit my review.|Negative
This will not work and humid climates, like Texas.|Negative
Besides being cooler, I love the sound of the water trickling down!|Positive
Winter grill cover for swamp cooler . I works ok still allows some cold air through .|Positive
This media fit our evaporative cooler perfectly. Unfortunately I couldn't find an equivalent in-store. Shipping was faster than expected so even that was no big deal.|Positive
The humidity is less than 25% outside and the cooler doesn't cool much. It is 97 outside and 88-90 inside. If I run it at night it is hotter inside than outside by 5-10 degrees, even with the windows open. Also it's quite noisy. Even just running the fan causes the unit to warm up. Bad choice.|Negative
This is the fourth summer I've used the fan. It works beautifully in my small bedroom. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.|Positive
Good product, good fit and good price|Positive
I bought it to fix my cooler. Thye price was great too.|Positive
It's okay... the temp indicator didn't drop at all. Humidity is around 30%-40% so I thought it should at least drop about 3-4 degree, but nope. Nonetheless, this is the smallest unit so I didn't expect miracle either. It's better than normal fan when I sit right in front of it.|Positive
It's a great product, a little noises but it get the job done. The air it's very cool, it push the hot out...|Positive
Works like it is made to work.|Positive
It deserves a 5 star rating. Period. If you want a 5 star cooler, this is the one. There is no brainier.|Positive
The Fan works really well and it’s nice that it’s easy to move. Not very cool though, doesn’t really do what the window units do. Blows around the air more than generates a cool air|Negative
The cover as advertised.|Positive
looks like it is well built, filled with water and long before it was full, I had a lake on the kitchen floor. leaking from the side close to the fill sight on the left side. HD agreed to refund|Negative
Purchased this unit and am very impressed by its cooling capacity. Built stand for window mounting and fit perfectly in my window with no modifications. Cools very rapidly and usually within 1/2 hour my house is a cool 60 degrees.|Positive
Not as powerful as I expected.|Negative
Item was a good fit for the cooler. The heavy duty canvas material should hold up well in windy and inclement weather.|Positive
These tie-downs works perfectly with the thick cooler cover. Thanks.|Positive
Good product used in a school bus barn shop. Dropped temp by 20 degrees.|Positive
"It works as a fan or if you add iced water it is supposed to add humidity to the air. I could not notice a difference between the fan and the ""evaporative cooler"". It seems a regular 3 speed fan would do the same thing for a lot less money."|Negative
This motor is too loud, and now it wont start on the low speed after only a 4 year, 3 months per year, service life. The motor will run on low speed if I start it on high speed so I know its not the controller. The squirrel cage on my cooler turns very easily so I also know that the problem is in the motor. I always stored my motor in the garage during the winter hoping it would last longer, and also ran the sheave at its minimum diameter resulting in the lowest speed possible. Low quality products like this cause harm due to their ending up in the land fill before a useful service life has occurred. Also the per-year cost for the consumer is higher than if we paid more up front for a durable motor. Junk|Negative
Worked perfectly|Positive
Hoping it would reduce room temperature, it does not. Great as a fan, no good as air cooler in central Virginia.|Negative
I think that the operating instructions could be improved. Example: I would like to use the equipment as a blower only (no water vapor) but the instructions do not tell me I can.|Positive
Junk, it is 3 years old and it is already rusting. The bearings went bad and the the shaft seized and it is on its second pump. It has been well maintained and replaced a 16 year old cooler that finally need replacing. I should have limped the old one along since it did not have this many problems and never had the bearings freeze. No one carries pads for this so you have to cut to fit, messy with the aspen and the blue pads do not work on this. Champion now sells junk, look elsewhere.|Negative
Very happy with the cooling of our guest bedroom using this swamp cooler. Sleek design and good price point. When you use either ice or the two ice packs in the water compartment, the room cools relatively quickly. Really like the remote and all of the functions with the timer, 3 fan speed settings, oscillating or not, and night time settings. We live in AZ where the humidity is low this time of year so it does help this front bedroom take the existing AC and make it about 10 degrees or more cooler.|Positive
These are the correct product to replace the pads on our swamp cooler; Model WC-44.|Positive
It’s the Best.. no noise & cools the area fast|Positive
Work very well. One small problem, the remote failed on day 2.|Positive
I have had this cooler for 3 years and love the compact design. I was a little disappointed that after a year I had to replace the pump at double the cost of a standard cooler pump. The pads also have to be replaced every year if you have hard water because when the pads get corrupted the cooler blows white powder around the house. The pads are also very expensive @ 100.00 dollars|Negative
The media fit my cooler perfectly. Infact better than the original. The cost was very affordable. My old material lasted 5years so cost was just $10/year. It arrived as a kit which included the mounting hardware. I would have given 5 stars had it arrived more quickly.|Positive
Material was heavy duty and excellent workmanship. While I was aware it is actually used on cooler units, my main use will be for an AC unit and would have been a perfect addition to have an open corner seam. With a little ingenuity, it will do just fine.|Positive
followed instructions and still it didn't do what it we were hoping for. Not only wasn't cool enough it was spraying water out towards you from the fan. The floor in front of the fan was always wet due to the spraying. So, no we were not happy with this.|Negative
"As others stated, it doesn't do a good job. I'm familiar with how evaporative coolers work, put it in front of an open window and had a window open about 10"" across the room, and I could barely feel it when seated in the path of where it was blowing (I'm in the high desert with about 6% humidity during the day, so this thing, if it were truly effective, should do wonders in a 10x12 room). The water reservoir interferes with the pump hanging down in the unit. Unsure if I got a broken unit or what, but 50% of the time when I return the full water reservoir back into the unit at refill time, the silicone tube disconnects from the pump and I have to remove the reservoir, flip the unit onto its front, fish around for the pump and re-seat the silicone tube onto the thing or else it won't pump water. Like I said, every other time I refill the unit I have to do this. It's JUNK. Note, the instruction manual says NOTHING about the pump or what to do if the pump won't stay put and instead hangs in the way of the water reservoir removal. Maybe I just got a lemon, but it seems others are in agreement that this is a piece of junk. Maybe worth $29, definitely not worth $189."|Negative
Media filter does exactly what it should do and fits snuggly. It smelled pretty badly at first but that has largely subsided now after a few weeks.|Positive
The covers that we had for years and years, with time finally were torn to the point that we had to replace them. Of course we went back to the store that we had purchased to them to begin with. God willing they will always be available for future years.|Positive
Perfect fit. Excellent quality|Positive
Water gauge no good|Positive
Didn't realize cooler is so small. Have 1150 Sq mobile n this cooler was 1100. Figured that would work because the next size was 1800. But it is not adequate. I need a bigger one but didn't know enuf about coolers before I bought it.|Negative
I have a large shop with several coolers in it. This one works good but not as good as some of our others do. This would be well suited for a smaller shop than I have.|Positive
Great product to hold the cover on my evaporative cooler. I bought 4 and used 3.|Positive
Easy to assemble and works exactly the way I expected. Keeps my garage studio comfortable during the hot desert months. Works so much better than the electric unit I had previously.|Positive
Very pleased with the unit. It was missing the carbon filter, but after a call to support, they were able to ship it out. Verify this when you receive the unit. I didn't notice this until it came time to take it apart and clean it at the end of the summer season.|Positive
This grille allows for the air vents to be adjusted. The metal ones get rusted and after a few months the rust do not allow you to move the vents. This plastic grille gives the ceiling a better look, too.|Positive
Product worked well for my needs|Positive
It took us FOREVER to find the correct filters but these were them! I had to call the coolers manufacturer to finally find them and find out Home Depot is the only distributer for them. No smell, great fit for our in wall unit, and arrived when promised. It was 94° the day we got it installed!|Positive
Very good so far|Positive
Easy to use. Cools well. Wife thinks it is noisy, but it doesn't seem too bad to me. All in all, very helpful on hot nights if you don't have air conditioning.|Positive
This fan is great! My house stays around 91 and this unit keeps my room around 80. When the air is directly on you it feels even cooler. My only complains is that the water compartment is not very big. It hold enough water to get through the night but that's about it so I always feel like I am filling it up. It's very easy to use though and the remote is a great feature. live in Colorado and I have to keep it in a vented room with my window open and door as well because if not it makes myroom super humid, but that's expected with any unit like this. Overall a great product for the money!|Positive
We put in cold water and ice cubes and it works like a charm. Love it!|Positive
Merchandise I ordered was received in excellent condition. Price was in reason for what I intended to use them. Store personnel were helpful in processing order in a timely matter.|Positive
The unit is easy to use and move. The water fill is in a very convenient location and it can be connected to an outside source for auto-fill. It hold lots of water. My only complaint is the location of the fill float. It's very low and is somewhat hard to read. Once you realize what it looks like and how to read it, it becomes a little easier. This product is not made in the USA.|Positive
The product is working like it was intended.|Positive
I was very disappointed with this product, and will be returning it. First, it must have been a return. The box was not glued on one side. There was no packing materials, no directions, and there were dings all over it. I decided to try it out rather than get a replacement in order to find if it would serve my purpose. I am a teacher on the second floor where the temperature can get to the 90's. The unit was so loud my students couldn't hear me, and many complained of a headache. The water reservoir is either too small, or the unit takes in a lot of water. It beeped at me several times a day wanting to be refilled. You could also hear a constant trickle of water which was annoying. If it cooled off the room, I may have put up with the rest, but this unit was nothing but a very expensive fan. I will be returning the unit for a refund.|Negative
Very good service and help by Home depot persons. Result of purchase was good, excellent.|Positive
The pump didn’t work so the danger icon stayed on and beeped I had to return it|Negative
Well made very sturdy fit my 2 new swamp coolers perfect with rounded corners the only way to go|Positive
Had this same one for years until it finally rotted from age and weather. Smart addition of Velcro closure, saves it from the sharp corners. Very heavy duty fabric, previous one lasted 10 years in the Arizona sun.|Positive
"These things work great in the desert. Not everyone knows what i am going to share, Set the unit in a window and then seal all the interior around the inlet duct. This prevents humidified air at the interior from being sucked back into the cooler through the pads. Humidified air won't cool as no evaporation can take place. This helps keep the unit operating at its most efficient. Install a bleeder ""T"" on the supply hose to the spider. This purges a minor amount of water that is full of dissolved solids left behind by evaporation. Run the bleeder line through the drain pipe and then out of the way, a good distance from the unit. 30 feet or better is good. Why, you ask? Alkali is a killer on cooler pads and this prevents build up. The discharge water needs to be dumped a good distance away (downwind) as it will evaporate and raise the humidity in the area, lessening the efficiency of the unit. these things will help this excellent piece of equipment work at its best. Good luck."|Positive
I cannot recomend this product. I installed the 4500CFM in my 31 ft winnebago in the back bedroom. Installation was easy. Had no problem installing by myself. Unit functions fine accept the purge pump I installed does nothing. The main issue is that this cooler is fine when it is below 85F then it is 72-74F. It is 98 degrees out in Quartzsite AZ with a low of 70F and with the cooler on high (1600cfm) and the pump drizzling water over the pads with a second box fan at 2500cfm blowing the air from the bedroom down the hall to living room the temperature in living room is 82F and the bedroom is 77F. I have both the driver and passenger windows open as well as a roof vent. Did have the door open till it was 11:30am. I have 1inch styrofoam panneling covering all my walls and windows with the silver bubblewrap over that as well as my awning out, a 31ft shade cloth covering the back side of rv, and windshield shade cloth. My rv has a max of 215 square foot... Soooooo... I should be frozen out of my rv with this on high... Yet my 12000btu ac can get it down to 78F in the living room. Don't see how this could handle a house. My other issue which I overcame was that these units come upsidedown in the manufacturers original box in which any manhandeling or drops and the bracket to the pump will break off in which the pump dangles by its wire and tubing thus smashing the pads and breaking the pump skirt. This has happened on 2 seperate orders. I ended up having to drive 80 miles to Lake Havasu to pick up in person. First box pads were smashed inside, but second box was fine. So I highly recomend purchacing this at the store and opening the box and taking off the back panel to look inside. Home Depot even lent me the screw driver to take off the two screws that hold the back on. Still... If this cannot even handle a 200 Square Foot Rv when it isn't even 100F out then I don't see the value in purchacing this unit and do not recomend.|Negative
Cover fits well at top of cooler but does not close tightly at the bottom draw string hem. The corner closure does not work well and even though the buckles/rings come together, it leaves big gaps. Lacing the corner closure and tying a knot at each buckle/ring is awkward and I can just imagine trying to untie those knots come Spring....... will likely need to use my knot wrench. Having just now installed it, I am unable to attest to the long term quality but have doubts that it will live much beyond it's warranty.|Negative
I haven't had a chance to really use it since I got it due to the humidity. I did use it for one day before the humidity arrived. I couldn't really tell if it made the room any cooler. I am going to try it again. One thing I don't like is I can't figure out how to remove the water reservoir. (Maybe it's not supposed to be removed.) I would like to be able to remove it, empty the old water, then add new cold water. Since I couldn't figure out how to get the reservoir out, I used a small cup to scoop it out. There HAS to be a better way. If not, then I can't recommend it. I hope it really cools the room I have it in. We'll see.|Negative
Though I have had good luck w/ Home Depot in the past I wasn't so lucky with this one. I purchased it because it had free shipping - for a 200 pound piece of equipment that is a plus. However it arrived dented in three different places. On top of that since I had a used 3/4 hp motor all I needed was the pulley and the one recommended for this unit had the wrong bore shaft. Other than that it works great just looks like it has been around the block. I guess I could have refused shipment but what would you do if you lived in Arizona in June?|Negative
durable to wind, would ike to see a draw string instead of tie string...faster|Positive
This cover is covering our air conditioner. The fabric is really good and it should last a long time.|Positive
the quality went way down from what they used to be. I've been working on evap coolers for 12 or 13 years... VERY disappointed with these!|Negative
Working great--excellant product|Positive
"I thought the worst of the troubles were the cheap water line hook up that blows out continually, the dented housing and the extremely noisy misalignment of the fan housing with no adjustments. No...there are no after market thermostats or even timers that work with this unit. When I contacted Champion customer service, they would not connect me with technical service and told me ""the engineering department doesn't even want us to give this information out"" referring to the fact that they do not put this information on the box or sales info for the product. Don't buy this product if you are looking for quality or service...they don't exist."|Negative
The winter grill cover is exactely what it should be. When it naps on you can tell it's a perfect fit and off with ease. Keeps out what should be out and in what needs to be in. Defiantly the right choice. Color and style is a match.|Positive
have small patio area it is great and keeps area usable in the summer heat. easy to move where we need it.|Positive
We started with the Honeywell 525 Unit, but it was a disappointment for our small sunroom. We returned that one and ordered this larger one. It really puts out the cool air. You have to have adequate ventilation of course, and you have to remember to refill as it does not have an automatic shutoff. But it has made the room livable in the summer. I am happy with this purchase.|Positive
This cooler belt is quality made and reasonably priced. I prefer home depot for all of my cooler needs.|Positive
Great product and a great price.|Positive
First let me say we use this to cool a patio-I purchased the portacool from the store for MUCH more money - got it home and was so disappointed took it back, and ordered this one based on reviews. It's Awesome!!!! much bigger air louvers and LOVE the oscillation factor. We sit outside daily - and you don't even notice it is 100+ degrees outside-Buy this product-you wont be sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|Positive
I originally bought the larger one through the mail and it came to me broken with a large crack in the bottom to which I was very disappointed because it's made of plastic which does make it very lightweight it bolts directly to your wall and you will probably want help with this. It is the quietest cooler I've ever heard I can sit directly beneath it and watch t.v. with no problem. However it's difficult to open and close for checking and removing the pads the little parts have to line up just so and being plastic can break easily threatening to break the machine with every change.which worries me. Although it keeps my house pretty cool and if it's not hot enough for it...down right cold. I recommend checking this product at the store before you buy it and hopefully you are mechanically inclined because it's not that easy to handle by yourself for sure I do love mine now that I have it and would probably buy again the best part about it is it takes almost no space on my front porch oh and it's quiet as a mouse. The pads run about $60..|Positive
Works excellent and cools the 1000 square feet of rental we own..|Positive
These pads were difficult to find but they really helped the cooling capability of our swamp cooler. They dropped the lowest cooled air temperature by about 5 degrees. That doesn't sound like much but when you're cooling 96 degree air to 67 degrees, that's a lot. These also fit my cooler without cutting which the blue synthetic pads required.|Positive
We use this pump for an ice machine and it works good.|Positive
this costs as much as an 5000 btu AC, but it will save you on the electric bill. All though it is little on the bulky side, it does have a powerful fan and it pushes out cool air. I live in the north east and this is my first swamp cooler, I can say I'm impressed.|Positive
Fits perfect...very satisfied|Positive
This did not cool whatsoever. All it did was add moisture into the air so it made our house feel like a jungle. This was essentially a VERY expensive fan.|Negative
Easy to install yourself with a basic water line kit to hose bib. I like that it includes the chain and rings to support the unit outside the window. It easily cools my large sunroom in 95 degree heat. Now for the bad news. The WH2906 model has a bleed off line that prevents damaging mineral build up. It wastes at least an additional 15 gallons of water per hour. The manufacturer suggested I contact their vendor to buy a programmable purge pump or live with the water waste. In my cheapness I'm manually emptying the unit every 8 hours of operation and disconnecting the bleed off line. I bought this product to save $ not to see my water bill skyrocket. The othernegative is the noise. Setting one is annoying. Setting two is hurricane loud. If my utility was not providing a rebate I would not be recommending this product.|Negative
"Shipping status was nonexistent, 1 half star rating for Home Depot's ""process""/information. Product is awesome. I work in the HVAC industry and I am very impressed with the performance of this cooler especially at this price point."|Positive
I've had my Master Cool for 12 years, and replaced the belt once, and the pads once. It delivers more air, at a lower temp, than any other evap cooler I've used. After 12 years, there's no rust, and it still runs and cools great. It saves me over $200/mo in electricity over AC. If you're getting an evap cooler, spend the extra money and get the best.|Positive
Over priced fan. Motor weak. Returned first one as motor didn't work at all and the replacement isn't much better. Very disappointed with this product|Negative
Unit arrived with dents and missing parts not happy..|Negative
The cooler is easy to use and does an excellent job of cooling with either the fan or the fan and water cooler. I have had this for about 2 weeks. I has helped me stay cool while my HVAC system has been broken and unusable during extremely hot weather.|Positive
Great tie downs, wished I would have had these before now. Very durable material and easy to put around cooler.|Positive
Since it's 'universal' there are several configurations which entails a little jigsaw puzzling to fit to a specific model -- but worked out well.|Positive
This unit cools my home well. I had to dismantle it to get it up on my roof but that was easy. Once up, reassembled and hooked up, it performed quite well. The only downside is the lack of a motor. It is not included so had to get one. I do like the unit!|Positive
Good fit and esay install just be careful taking nuts off big pad|Positive
As an evaporator cooler it works well but at times it does not distribute the water over the cooling material (pads) in a consistent manner. I have to give it a smack on the side to get the water to flow. The hose bib supplied is having issues with leaking on my garage floor. Not good.|Negative
"I bought a set of pads at my Local Home Depot about two or three years ago. I had to use a lot of water to flush out the orange color that drained from them. After that, the odor the pads created in the cool air filled the house, and that continued for days before it began to dissipate. And beyond that, they never did cool as well as another set of Pads I had purchased. Nearly FOUR months ago I asked here where these ""Max Cool"" pads were manufactured but never got an answer. I then used the E-mail online message contact and that also did not get a response. Another reseller states that they tried the pads made ""you know where"" and they smelled and did not cool as well. I don't know where these are made but I am about to buy my pads from a dependable source; not here."|Negative
Exactly as described. I couldn’t open a window so I run a 20 in. fan several feet behind it. It’s perfect for the Southwest and powerful enough to cool a room. Don’t bother adding water if humidity is 50%. Very satisfied with my purchase.|Positive
Exactly what I was looking for. Fit well.|Positive
Fits perfectly (as expected) and prevents the draft from outside.|Positive
Easy install. Cools my whole 2300 sq. Ft. House. I love it am thrilled with operation and everything. Delivery service was excellent as well. Right to my doorstep.|Positive
We live in Eastern Ontario and always find our home warmer upstairs even with central air conditioning. We put the evaporative cooler in the second floor hallway and noticed a difference right away. Not only is it cooler but it is a good fan too for circulating the air. It especially helps at night because it is esier to sleep without all that hot air.|Positive
Product has worked very well so far|Positive
Works just like it should. Not too big or hard to handle.|Positive
Fit correctly. No odd smells. Works well.|Positive
I found several stripped nuts and bolts. Unable to remove side vent. Stripped screws securing spider drip lines. Looking at the quality of the material in general I wonder how long it will hold up with corrosion. I am shipping it back. Not much in window units out there to choose from. Too bad MasterCool is no longer making these. My old MC is 12 yrs. old and still works.|Negative
The evaporative air cooling system has been the best system for the HOT dry summer in Ojai, CA. It is easy to set up and works with in minutes of turning it on. The portable system works well moving from room to room.|Positive
I bought this as a back-up. Haven't actually installed it yet.|Positive
This isn't two large pads, it's a box full of little ones uou have to fit in the cooler. Not efficient. Not what I wanted at all. NOT recommended.|Negative
I have had this for a little over a month now and I still can't figure out how to put this on. I have two chains that are anchored to my house that attach to the top outside corners of the unit. I cant slide it over the chains.... Other than that issue, this is a great product made of quality material. May not be top quality but it is a decent quality. If I could put it on, I could see it lasting at least 5-10 years considering the aging affects of the sun and the elements.|Negative
This pump died within a month. i got it to replace my Master Cool pump that had finally died after 15 years of service to my home. don't waste your money : (|Negative
This item is about twice as expensive as a standard evap cooler, yet it has some serious deficiencies. First, all the switching logic for the pump and hi/low speed must be supplied by the customer. I would have expected that the unit would have had a power input and hi/low/off input, with internal relays to complete the logic. Second, there is no connection/hole in the bottom of the wet unit to allow draining via external access, either manually at the unit or by a long tube with a valve at the bottom--you must gain access to the unit, remove the filter panel and filters, and then unplug the overflow tube. For a rooftop installation, this requires access to the unit. In Colorado, there are weather extremes that often result in a person turning on or off the heat/cooling systems, then a week later having to reverse the situation. This is not great for a rooftop unit that has to be accessed every time you begin filling it or draining it.|Negative
This is a nice tower fan that also blows cool air. It comes with a remote and has the usual setting for a tower fan. Controls are easy to use. The fan is a bit loud but not worse than most fans of this size. It has a water tank on the bottom. I put ice packs and water into the tank then it blows cool air. Once the ice packs warm up then the breeze becomes room temperature. A very nice feature. Just put a ton of ice packs in so you don't have to keep running to the freezer.|Positive
Perfect! Can't believe they are not a stock item in store|Positive
We recently had our hottest day so far this season, and I credit the AF-1000R portable evaporative cooler for saving the day in my NON-air conditioned home. It's light and easy to move from room to room, so I rolled it from my bedroom into the kitchen with ease. As it cools up to 300 square feet, it kept the kitchen comfortably cool for my family and guests (and looked cool, as well, with its cheery red color). I received the cooler free for review yet would have gladly paid full price for one, considering how great it works in the dry and hot Colorado climate.|Positive
Meh. Had to refill it constantly, and it didn't do much for our little 2 by 2 desk block. The blower is very directional, so the cool air doesn't spread easily, and it's a bit loud for a unit that just sits in the corner. I did like the remote feature, but in order for it to actually cool you have to hit two buttons in succession - most users would only think to hit one button, then they're wondering why the air isn't cooling off. We had it for a week and returned it.|Negative
The plastic air deflector is the only one available, but as this is used in a rental mobile home the tenants usually break off the flaps on this product. At the price it is not a good value.|Negative
Easy install. Even went back and bought the two tie-down straps for it.|Positive
Works great!,,,|Positive
Easy to install!! Runs great.|Positive
This is the swamp cover you want, the rest are just cheap thin replicas that won't last two seasons.My last Brian's Canvas cover on my large down draft swamper lasted 10 years, even though I had to do some patching the last 4 years with silicone adhesive and old cut up jean material.|Positive
Cover didn't come down far enough to cover half the AC vents - didn't match the dimensions that were advertised. Also the cinching cords on the sides didn't allow much slack to be pulled out, leaving the cover not very snugly attached. I worry it will blow off with a strong gust of wind and will place a rock or weight on top of the cover.. On the good side, the material is great and it seems to be built well, good stitching. I believe this cover will last for many years.|Positive
This grill fit the front of our Champion evaporative cooler perfectly!!! Thank you!|Positive
This unit is perfect for my small house. This summer has been pretty humid, but most of the time it works beautifully. No more heart attacks looking at my electricity bill.|Positive
great product, fit perfectly.|Positive
Very good quality. Canvas is really thick. We really like them and would buy them again.|Positive
Well engineered. Excellent air flow. It took two days to install but well worth the extra work needed over the cheap versions of plug-and-play coolers. The inner electronics are easy to access and very easy to understand the diagnostic tests of every aspect of the units functions. If I were to find any fault it would be in the shipping as sheet metal of any form is subject to small dings and dents. The company making the unit had packed it very well but the whims of physics and motion of transportation did cause some cosmetic damage, however I was able to fix it myself. Overall, an excellent cooler and it cools my 2400 square foot home with ease. I was going to originally purchase the 7000cfm but now I'm glad I did not as I would then have to open more windows to let in the 105 degree heat. A tip for installing is to use a cordless drill for the screws and place the screws in a container large enough so it will not blow away with the wind. Also, don't use much torque when reinstalling the panels and screws after completing the setup.|Positive
Once we got it hoisted on the roof installation was a breeze! My house is cool again!|Positive
Very good quality.|Positive
Normally these pumps are very reliable but stopped working after 2 days. I will be returning it for an exchange.|Positive
Froze up on me and almost tossed it. Sprayed with wd-40 and started working again. If you buy this pump make sure you oil and check it before turning it on the following year. Turn it by hand until it starts spinning.|Negative
A good product to help extend the life of the evaporative cooler.|Positive
"I used it to make a patio cooler. With a ""squirrel cage"" as opposed to a blade fan, it's much quieter than the prefab patio units, supplies a higher volume of air - and colder air. Thermometer registered 74 degree output on a 100+ degree day in 30% humidity."|Positive
Still working on installing the window cooler but have used Champion cooler before and am sure that I will be enjoying the coolers for a long time|Positive
It did not blow cool air but rather luke cool.. would be great as a fan but nothing more.|Negative
This is a good product. I'd advise you to paint the unpainted surfaces of the interior metal parts. The Fan and the Axel and screws are subject to rusting. I've bought 3 of these now and the installation is pretty straightforward. The corrosion, rust, and calcification are a continual issue. The Birch cooler pads are effective. They do deteriorate over time and leave particulates in the pan. The blue foam filters have been a better solution. Use caution removing the grill screws the mounts are easily broken. There are various sharp metal edges. It's best to use Gloves installing and servicing the cooler. The Window installation is somewhat difficult and the parts provided are less than useful. No water tubing is included. You will need a special fitting and valve to connect it to a Residential hose bib.|Negative
We are very pleased with our new swamp cooler... TY!|Positive
Nice airflow, not as cool as we thought but at least we now can use our patio in the summer here in Arizona. One issue is the internal float does not work well enough to keep the water adjustment at appropriate leavels. Need to manually add water.|Positive
Worked 1/2 hour then started leaking water all over the place. Not worth $349|Negative
Decent design and user friendly. I liked that the add water door had a push snap lock so that it isn't always falling open. Also like the adjustable pump feature on top so that you can control the amount of water that is being trickled through the pad. Unfortunately, the size of the pad is not adequate to supply enough surface area for the power of the air flow of the fan setting except for on Medium or less. If this baby had additional side panel pads, I am willing to bet it would work excellently!|Negative
Purchased for home near beach with lots of humidity & wasn't sure it would work but it's great and helps cool the house (without an AC unit!)! Best investment ever!|Positive
We love it! In fact we ordered another one. We use it on our patio at the lake because ceiling fans aren't enough. Easy to set up and move where you want. I recommend this little jewel.|Positive
Simple, extremely easy to operate and by the way, portable!! Definitely useful in a room you occupy the most.|Positive
It keeps on throbbing after it is shut down, The only way to stop the throbbing is to pull the plug.|Positive
Easy to put on and works great house is now cool again|Positive
Easy enough to install, and the low setting is very cool for our place on a 95 degree F day. Don't know if we'll ever need the high setting ....? Just, that's it's a bit loud, even on vent settings which is unfortunate. Otherwise, so far, happy this week!|Positive
Works. Does cool one room add bonus my Plants love it.|Positive
Cover fit nicely and was easy to install. as for durability I will have to wait and see, just installed this month. Will know better by next year.|Positive
It is good product. It kept my house cooler during hot days.|Positive
So far it does what it is supposed to. We will have to make sure it holds up for a particularly hot day.|Negative
This Product works GREAT! Supper Cold air. Blows Nice and Strong, we placed this cooler our banquet hall the cooler blew the glasses off the table. LOL and it was on medimun level. I turned it on high it blew me back. I'm telling you This cooler works Great!|Positive
Was easy to assemble. Using it in my double car garage/workshop. The cooler made in comfortable to work in. I live in central California where temps here are 98 to 100+ degrees everyday during the summer months.|Positive
This pump replaced a broken pump in a evap cooler I was refurbishing, it fit right and works fine.|Positive
The motor was easy to install and worked like a charm. Quite so I have to double check if it is running|Positive
I love that it works with just the fan or while there is water in it for the evaporation cooling. It is noisy, but not as noisy as the one we had before. This one has double the media panel space for cooling, while taking up the same amount of floor space as our old one. We rinsed the media panels a couple of times outside of the unit, and then put them in again. We didn't have any start up smell when we used it then.|Positive
This product is made of a heavy canvas material which should last many of our San Diego winters. It also looks better than a plastic trash bag which hardly lasted one winter, although I wish it came in other colors.|Positive
I am Sorry To Say, I am not happy with this product at all.. When, I first got a month ago, tried to fill it up with water and ice, as instructed in users manual. And, the pull down flap, you have to pull down to put the water in, it broke on very first try. Then, after having it about- 2 weeks- it started to leak water, out of somewhere, still can't figure out where... And, I mean it, practically drains out from the unit onto my carpet soaking it, in a very short period of time. Here is the kicker of it, it leaks water out- even while it is turned off. We will be returning this unit, tonight.. Unfortunately, I thought it was the answer to my prayers, turns out it is might nightmare, so far- Very Disappointed customer..|Negative
I bought this cooler two years ago. In that two years I have had to repair it about 10 times. The end of last year I would have to rap a cord around it and pull start it. If I was to use it this year it would need a new float, new motor, new pump, new belt, new bearings, and pads. I have also install the Master Cool product and they seem better made. This coolers sheet metal is so thin the sheet metal screws strip very easy when adjusting the belt. Buy some other one, this is garbage|Negative
The whole package was user friendly except for the operating instructions. Not very intuitive. The small window calls for a better set of operating instrucrions.|Positive
This is what an evaporator is suppose to be!!|Positive
excellent product and perfect customer service i am very happy|Positive
High winds this week and they stayed on the roof. Covering the turbines keeps heat in during the winter. These work well.|Positive
I've had high winds and the cover has not moved|Positive
It fit|Positive
The Hessaire MC37M Evaporative Cooler has accomplished everything I needed to get done. High temperatures, over 100 degrees, caused my wife to suffer from heat prostration. Considering we live in a small home, I felt it was best to acquire a small cooler to reduce the possibility of a re-occurrence|Positive
Works as described.|Positive
TERRIBLE! Drain plug instantly leaked like crazy all over rug...|Negative
Very simple to hook up, lots of cool air. Only problem was caused by UPS, first delivery was sent back to Home Depot due to damage incurred during shipping, second delivery made it intact. I like this unit as it does not take up a lot of space and with the large amount of cooling media, is capable of making lots of cool air.|Positive
We are waiting to pay on our card so we can build a stand to put it on. We still haven't installed it. But what we see so far, we live it.|Negative
These do not last as long as they use to. Bought so many so I don't have to run to the store or worry when something happens when the store is closed.|Negative
"We were in the middle of a terrible heat wave in Northern California. We purchased this cooler out of desperation. It truly helped us survive the heat. We love the portability and ease of use. It offers everything that it promised. We would definitely purchase this product again. We have used it in our bedroom and office with much success. Our Catahoula hound ""Goldie"" loves laying on the bed in direct line of the cooler."|Positive
Its kind of early to to give an evaluation of this product.|Negative
Best Deal for Your Money, Box showed up questionable,turned out fine.Easy to set up,very light to move,a #2 Phillips screwdriver all that is needed to install the wheels,2 have lever locks. Manual Easy to fill from the front access point, Recommend a water hose with a attachment to slide into the port,would approximate it uses 10 gallons in the tank,only takes about 5 min . A water hose point is available as well for full time use. Adapter included. I avg fill twice a day 80+ outside,its 5/10 degrees cooler inside. Set up your drafts and this works Great.|Positive
Purchased for use in 3 car garage/shop. Has been very effective. Fill with hose each day after 6+ hours of use.|Positive
The cooler I have is a replacement for one that lasted 15 years & I have reasons to believe this one will do better its made up better of better materials that is easy to see the true test will be this summer when the weather is HOT !!!|Positive
i installed one last year. it was quite effective on the low speed w a 1/2 hp motor. i would buy one again if i needed one. 1450 square ft. home. semi arid climate.|Positive
Works great, but it is HUGE & Noisy. Outdoor application seems more practical.|Negative
Worked good. Ended up needing to clean the distribution tubing as well. Plenty of power to push out all 8 lines on my swamp cooler.|Positive
Thought it might work to keep the garage a little cooler, but did not. It only made it so humid we couldn't stand it. Unfortunately, we returned it. It may work fine outdoors but we did not need it there.|Negative
With this you just have to put the wheels on and fill it with close to 15gal of water and your are ready to begin. Please keep in mind, that if it feels cold coming out, the hot air around needs a while to be cooled in a building. I like the rotation from left to right and connecting a water hose to have constant water is very efficient. I rated it four stars because of the size of the manual filling door. (I like to add ice every once in a while.)|Positive
Have to put in water too often.Otherwise it's a great unit. Cools great!|Positive
Cons:It arrived with the float level that measures the water level stuck.When hooked up to the hose, the check-valve did not stop it from overflowing, but seemed to resolve when lowering the pressure.Pros:It's cold and puts out a lot of air.It has a sweeping feature.|Positive
Air flow was outstanding|Positive
Quick easy replacement, just remove and replace|Positive
U Get What U Pay For ~ It Leaks~Leaks~Leaks Water ~ All of The Time on Every Speed Setting ~ Don't Buy Any Thing From SPT Company|Negative
These turbine covers are simple to install and the heavy canvas is durable. These covers are far superior to the plastic cover which I have found to last less than one winter. .I purchase these same canvas covers 2 years ago and found the canvas is durable, but the cord on these covers is a polyester material which breaks down quickly in the sun and rain, which causes the cover to fly off in the wind I have had to replace the cords with bailers twine which is much more durable and very inexpensive. I did this on the 3 covers I currently own and I expect to have to do this with the 3 covers I just purchased., I recently installed 3 more Lomonco turbines. I expect to get 3 years service out of these covers after I replace the poly cord with the twine after the first year. Since you are asking for a review, if I were making these covers, I would put two cords on the covers, one at the very bottom and another 6 inches up from the bottom in side of a seamed channel all the way around the circumference, the same as the bottom cord channel. This would be used to cinch down the cover to base just under the actual moving part of the turbine. In heavy winds the single bottom tie cord migrates up the immobile conduit to just below the larger diameter turbine. The extra material at the top created by this migration actually flaps in the wind which puts excessive stress on the poly cord causing it to break usually within the first year.|Positive
My feeling on the design is that the tie-down should be done in velcro rather than a piece of string|Positive
Assembly was easier than expected. Wheels were in a compartment on the bottom of the cooler and quickly screwed into the sturdy base. I screwed the water hose into the connector and turned the water on. It wasn't filling until I opened the back panel and pushed the float down from the shipping position. Then it worked great with no leaks. It is a little noiser than I would prefer in the low fan position but other than that it works great. Now I have cool air on the patio instead of a ceiling fan that just moves the hot air around.|Positive
The cooler has great options. Even has a room temperature reading. Works for our livingroom.|Positive
So far work’s great. Adding moisture into the air is the best part|Positive
Cools the space really efficiently, but did wish I had an instruction manual ...just with the basic info :)|Positive
The cooler had a different part number, but the cross reference helped me order exactly what I needed, and it fit! This is the first time in 12 years that I had to replace the media inside. The quality of the cooler has been great in our dry climate. The free shipping and quick delivery was the icing on the cake|Positive
This is absolutely perfect for camping trips! It's lightweight, works great, and the price was perfect! I love it and am so very glad I purchased it! No more dying of heat in those dry climates!|Positive
does the job well easy install|Positive
Product only worked for about a week. Very poorly. Goes through water every 2hrs. Small tank. Don't waste your money on this thing. Now only the fan works. Spend the extra $50 and get something better. Wish I would have never bought this thing.|Negative
Used the cooler cover on the outside a/c unit to cover during the winter. Cover was a good fit and the quality was great. I have used this type of cover before and the last for years. Better quality then the nylon type covers. The price was also much better then the other type covers. Thanks Home Depot.|Positive
It cools well, and the size and noise level are great, but one of the fan functions stopped working less than two weeks after purchase.|Negative
I used this motor to replace the one that gave out on my cooler that is over 10 years old. It mounted right up to the existing brackets with no problems. I was able to use the same electric cord and pulley from my old motor. Installation only took about a half an hour. Store personnel were helpful. I brought in my old motor to verify everything would fit. The store associate opened the box with the new motor so I could compare measurements before the purchase. I’m completely satisfied with this purchase.|Positive
Maybe I just don't know how to use this thing but with a cross breeze it didn't cool the room at all and without it it turned the room into a swampy hot mess. Just get a standing AC unit.|Negative
The order of the contacts in the directions are different from the order of the contacts on the motor. Thus, it flipped the circuit when installed. After correct this, the motor otherwise seems fine, though a bit noisy.|Negative
I had to replace a portable swamp cooler that I bought at Home Depot which had died after about 2 years of use. This one was $50 cheaper, holds more water, is quieter and I'm pretty sure pushes out more air.|Positive
easy to install|Positive
It turned out to be a good product and It meet my expectations.|Positive
This works great! Thinking about getting another.|Positive
Partially my fault. Ordered pads for cooler. Received 1 large pad and 2 smaller pads. Called Customer Service. They said they would request pad size be put on 1st screen. That would be nice.|Negative
Bought this cooler for a small shop. Being in a fairly humid area (south georgia) I don't expect it to lower the temperature of the whole building, just too aim it where you will be working and enjoy. This thing does an excellent job of cooling air and putting out a good amount of air. It does feel pretty cheap. It's all plastic and several different pieces at that. The pieces don't all sit flush against each other. The whole unit shakes as it runs as if the fan is slightly out of balance. The bolts that hold the wheels on were missing out of the box on the unit received. They are 8x1.25 metric thread in case anyone else has the same problem. With all that said, I do recommend this product. It does an excellent job. As long as it holds up in the long run it's so much more cooler for your money than a portacool.|Positive
One pad was damaged and there were no installation instructions.|Negative
It works good in one room. It seems to take a lot of water but hard to tell since are other swamp cooler had hose hooked up to it. I would purchase it again.|Positive
Fit perfectly and instructions were easy to follow|Positive
These pads work better than the foamed polyester pads,i always used these pads but i wanted to try the foam pads & doesnt work the same,goin back to these pad,i totally regret changing them to the blue ones|Positive
This thing is just an expensive fan. I have owned other evaporative coolers so I know what they're supposed to feel like. This just feels like a fan. Even when I put ice in it. Returning it to the store ASAP. either I have a defective unit or the other reviews are bunk. I live in Los Angeles where it is very dry so this thing should work like a dream and instead it's a dud.|Negative
The fan did not work. We are waiting for a new motor to be sent.|Negative
Bolted/clamped right in ... easy R&R ... works just fine, as expected ...|Positive
We paid for a product that is made in the US. We wanted the best American product. To support our local economy and to create jobs. Instead, we got an American metal box with only components made in China and Mexico! Not what we paid for! do not write made in the USA if it isn't!|Negative
This product was shipped ups to my local store (45 miles away from me) with free shipping. There was no ship to home availiable. The price was reasonable,the processing time was rather slow but the shipping was speedy. The pulley is a cast aluminum or zinc and has some sharp areas so beware when handling. I purchased these for a speed reduction setup on my #32 meat grinder. Works like a charm!|Positive
We bought this for a small room 150 square feet and it does the job. Has enough water storage to last the entire night. It's small and portable so we move it around the house. For dry weather in CA it works for us.|Positive
Works great, it was exactly what we needed. I would recommend.|Positive
Bought this during the recent heat wave,but before you start setting up you MUST take off the back cover and check the pump. My unit was probably dropped during shipping and the pump was sitting cockeyed, not sitting at the bottom where water would submerge the pump. My unit ran for an hour and I noticed there was no water dripping down the media. I opened it up, affixed the pump, rinsed out the tank, primed with clean reverse osmosis water, placed the media back, and voila. a cool breeze. It took my 400sq ft living room baking at 90F down 5 degrees in one hour, 10 degrees in 2 hrs and 20 degrees in four hrs. Kill-a-watt confirmed my savings, Cha-Ching!|Positive
It really works! I placed it at the end of a long living room/office area that is much larger than 250 sq. ft. and we could feel the cooling effects throughout the whole house. It is not super quiet but not super noisy. The set up required almost no effort.|Positive
Good product store had a mix up but found product and had it ready the next day.|Positive
Cover fit my cooler perfectly. when placing the cover over my cooler the oil from the canvas did did stain the shirt I was wearing but the stain washed out easily.|Positive
Holds an adequate amount of water...since it was very dry it worked very well... Southern Arizona... humidity down around 5 to 10 Percent... had to fill twice during the course of the day... our rooftop cooler went out so we needed something quick! This has served our needs very well. found a place in our house where it is capable of cooling the whole house... 1600 Sq. Feet. Not a typical floor plan. Only down side is that it is very noisy... the very nature of the fan type.|Positive
Love it!! The 3 speed , 5300 can cooler works excellent. It came quickly and was easy to setup.I like the ease of how to fill it.|Positive
Does not cool down a room as advertised even with ice and water..|Negative
Best evaporative cooler for the money. Its slim, uses the best cooling pads, and puts out a lot of air. I had a friend purchase the same one with the same feedback. I have had it about two months living in Phoenix AZ and it works great. With the weight of the water tank, it would be better with a metal bottom plate to attach the caster wheels as I might see the plastic breaking in the future rolling it over expansion cracks in the concrete. I will recommend this product to anyone!|Positive
The grill cover was easy to install. It is keeping out the cold air.|Positive
The motor burned up and the fan blade broke the first week|Negative
Fit perfectly!|Positive
Fan started to make a grinding noise after about 5 hours of use. Very cheaply made.|Negative
The fan was very noisy when I installed it. The pulley on the motor was loose, as well as two screws holding strut. Had to adjust the belt tension and alignment. Housing rattled until I caulked the joints with silicone. Now it works okay.|Negative
The cover is easy to install|Positive
it works just fine|Positive
The covers fit well. And seem like the material used will last in the dry desert. Have had some from other stores that almost didn't make it through the season. Have had good luck with Home Depot's brand.|Positive
Standard switch ....When a thermostat just won't do.|Positive
It always thought the water was low, so the pump would turn on. Call the hotline, but it is just an answering machine. Felt like a scam.|Negative
After a stupidly hot summer in eastern Washington state it was time do get a cooling system for the house. In normal years, this area has at most 10 days of upper 90's to low 100's each year. This year we have had record 90/100 degree days. We built our home 2 years ago with a north facing view with a lot of large windows. From 4pm until sunset, the sun beats down on us. Until I put up window shades, it was not unusual to have 90 degree temperatures in our living room. Three weeks ago I finally broke down and and began my research. On the Home Depot site I saw this window evaporative cooler. Since I was familiar with these type of coolers from my days living at Fort Huachuca, AZ in the early 1980's, I became intrigued. I had two concerns...could this cooler cool down my 25'x25' great room with a 24' ceiling that also included two large open side rooms, and, would the added humidity make the space uncomfortable. I am happy to report neither is an issue. As I'm typing this, the outside temperature is 100 with 8% humidity. My great room is 77 with 42% humidity, and it feels cool with the ceiling fan going. Very few people in this area have evaportive coolers, but because summers are typically very dry, there is the added benefit of adding moisture to the living space, which helps out with dry skin and sinus issues. Installation: I'm by no means a handy man, but I watch YouTube first before doing anything. That's how I figured out how to install this cooler before even buying it. Although it's better if two people do the work, I managed to do it by myself. That includes hoisting the pieces up an 8' ladder and putting it through the window. The instructions are well written. I only got confused by the fact that an internal hose has to be connected to the cover in order for the water to be pumped up to the top of the housing before it runs over the paper filter. Follow instructions carefully and you'll be fine. I made a list of all the parts I would need to properly install it. That included all of the part for the water line. I connected the water line inside the garage, because it happens to have a faucet connected to treated/softened water for washing cars. (Our well water has iron and a goodly amount of minerals that is treated by an iron filter and a water softener.) This should help with the normal mineral buildup on the unit's filter. Pay special attention to making the unit level. That is important so that the water runs properly over the filter and so that the water doesn't spill over from the bottom reservoir. Just like most things, there are a couple of negatives. 1) Like several other reviews have mentioned, the until is loud. I just turn up the TV and all is OK. The fact that it cools the house at a fraction of the electricity cost that an A/C uses makes all the difference for me. 2) The filter does smell for the first eight hours or so. It does go away. (...or maybe I got used to it.) 3) The quality control inspector needs to pay a bit more attention. The small control panel was pushed in from its housing. Perhaps that might have happened during shipping. The box was a bit rough. Some of the clips that hold the filter in place were also broken. But, it comes with a couple of extra ones. 4) I wish the instruction would address installation for windows other than top-down sliders. I have left/right-sliding windows and I had to figure out on my own how to securely attach the unit. (BTW. I used rigid styrofoam insulation to fill the window opening above the unit. It doesn't help with securing the unit, but helps keep hot air out.) Customer support. I did call customer support twice, just to make sure I wasn't doing something stupid. Both times it was a sales lady that answered and not a technician. However, both were knowledgeable about the product and provided me with the answers that I needed. Overall I am very pleased with the unit and no longer dread the dog days of summer (Just noticed that at 7pm the outside temperature is 102, but still 77 inside. I'm cool as a cucumber.)|Positive
Fit like it was supposed to,|Positive
Works great for what we needed|Positive
Good follow-up. Product does what I want it to do. It keeps me comfortable on my back porch in the summer.|Positive
I used it in my room and closed the window it didn't cool off my room it was still hot|Negative
It was extemely loud even on low & really did not blow cold air Very disappointed....Returned it!|Negative
It provides the pump action needed to provide cool air in the home.|Positive
Powerful air flow yet unit is quiet and unobtrusive - about as quiet as a quietest available conventional window air conditioner . Cools best with aspen pads - I buy the 32x36 aspen pads at home depot and cut them with strong scissors to a size that fits the BW5002. The replacement floats and water pumps sold at Home Depot also fit the BW5002, with minor modifications. I buy a mesh water pump filter at Home Depot too to help prevent the water pump from sucking up aspen pad debris. The cooler set up instructions are not the best in regard to clarity and idiotproofness so a swamp cooler novice may make some mistakes installing the float and water supply line to the cooler.|Positive
Unfortunately this did not work for me, I have a 200 Sq Ft AZ room that I needed to cool, this was for 300 Sq ft so thought it would be adequate, it did nothing unless you sat on top of it. It did put a lot of moisture in the air though. I have tried it three times only, now it just sits there. I have been unable to return it to the store as I have no-one to help me. It is nice looking and easy to use, love the wheels on it. I gave it a 2 rating just because it did not do what I needed.|Negative
This fit my Champion Evap. Cooler Model No. RWC-50 perfectly.|Positive
very good product, works great|Positive
Plug and play!|Positive
Very good. Easy to install|Positive
Motor faulty. Burned out the first day.|Negative
Combining the Up-Dux with an evaporative cooler in my AZ garage was the best decision I have made this summer. Lowered my garage temperature and the Up-Dux delivers cooler air to my attic and out the vents. What a team. First installed Up-Dux in a home back in the 80's and they worked so well that there was no question in my mind, what I would use in this install.|Positive
This Evaporative Cooler has saved this girl from humid Houston who has found herself transplanted in dry hot southern Utah! Not only does it cool me off, but it cut nosebleeds from dry weather down significantly thanks to the fact that it can double as a giant humidifier. I do wish it would just automatically turn the cooler off when the water levels gets too low, and the indicator of max water is a bit wonky. Sometimes you have to shake the cooler to get it to realize it should lift up and show you the current water level. If it fixed that and just had an automatic shut off (so I could leave it on without worry, but wouldn't lose the air flow from the fan) then I would give it a 5.|Positive
We really do enjoy this cooler. Works great for our patio. These Texas summers can be brutal at times and this cooler not only cools the humans it cools the fur animals too. Would definitely recommend|Positive
Good buy and right size for my cooler. Material paint doesn’t come off like the others.|Positive
Bought this for my new orchid house. It’s perfect. I would recommend it.|Positive
Absolutely perfect fit. Bought a new cooler this year and wanted to keep it from getting rusted like the old one. This is made of very durable material and it was very easy to install. My extremely money cautious friend was very impressed with the quality and the low price.|Positive
I live in a very hot, dry area; this unit brought my room down from mid 80's, 30% humidity to mid 70's, 60% humidity. Only problem was it leaked from the drain plug put of the box and was a bit difficult to tighten, but after I got it snug, it hasn't leaked a drop. Overall very happy with the purchase.|Positive
working very good|Positive
This product is easy to use. However, it uses water faster than I expected. There are two small freezable thermos type bottles with it, too.|Positive
Met expectations and made it easy!|Positive
I use it in a 2200 sq ft home,it runs all day but cools it quite nicely!!!|Positive
This is a great little evaporative cooler. I was a steal when we got it in early July for $127. It's pretty quiet on low but puts out a lot of cool air. In combination with its big brother 2200 cfm Hessaire, we can keep the house in the low 70's even when it is 95+ outside, and we have no AC. We are in northern Nevada so have the advantage of a very dry location. The little guy has a hose connection but we fill it with a jug, I'd guess it goes through about a gallon per hour. There is an open window on the other side of the room and the fan in the window is blowing out. This seems to keep the humidity under control. Regarding the initial smell, we just filled it and ran it outdoors for an hour, then dumped the water (there is a drain plug) and repeated the process a couple more times. No smell at all after this. Highly recommend!|Positive
There are several options for garage cooling, however, being a garage, portable and easy is what usually works the best. This little swamp cooler does the job. If you aren't familiar with swamp coolers, they are very popular in the desert climates.. dry air. They work by pulling air over a water soaked pad and blowing it into your room. Yes, humidity will increase. That is how they work. This one in particular is larger than I thought it would be. It is on caster wheels and glides well on the garage floor. Even full of water, it moves easily. There is a hose connection on the side for continued use in an outdoor area, which will self regulate the tank level. One reviewer said it wouldn't make sense to run a hose through your house - good thing you don't have to as there is a water fill in the top. You can also add ice to the top so as it melts, the colder water from ice melt will enter the tank and therefore cool better. The unit I received is a 3 speed cooler, although it says 2 speed. There is the option to turn off the pump altogether and use it as just a fan as well. There is a swing option to oscillate the fan (back and forth) and the louvers are adjustable up and down - the two sets move independent of each other as well, so you can direct half the air flow up and half the air flow down if you want. It's not a super quiet unit, but also not overly loud and annoying either. The water pads are serviceable, and usually with other swamp coolers I have used, I replaced or cleaned them annually. If this kind of cooler will work in your dry climate, I suggest this as an option for general cooling at a fraction of the price it costs to run an A/C unit. Water is relatively cheap, and the electricity to run this is nowhere near a compressor A/C unit.|Positive
Using the product on a lanai in Florida. Not as ideal a use for this type cooler as the southwest, but it really takes the edge off the summer heat. My only concern is the packaging. The box was mangled on delivery at my local store. The pump was broken internally and I had to repair it myself with replacement parts sent by the manufacturer. I couldn't use it for two weeks after I bought it. Not a great start. But once I fixed it, it operates as expected and I am glad I bought it.|Positive
Good design with both internal and external threads. Did need a second valve as the first one did not completely seal. Typical for this design. Second valve works flawlessly.|Negative
I live in Denver so definitely a dry climate, but this cooler doesn't do much, and I wasn't expecting a lot. It has fan mode, and cool mode - which requires water. Neither mode did anything to actually lower the temperature, but the cool mode makes the room almost unbearably humid and it actually feels hotter. I have an indoor thermometer in the room and after hours of running in cool mode, the temperature did not drop at all, but the relative humidity went up about 20%. We basically use it as a giant fan, which works well, but is very overpriced.|Negative
I'mvery satisfied with this product|Positive
Cools the whole house...|Positive
"The unit was larger than expected based on the online photo. Not practical for moving up an down stairs, but rolls easily between the two upstairs rooms with poor air circulation where it will be used. ice compartment is a great feature for instant cooling. Personally, didn't notice any significant plastic smell once unit was set up. Instructions easy to understand. That said, the latch on the cover to the water tank fill compartment doesn't open easily and needs more design thought; too finicky in my opinion. The control panel is unnecessarily hard to read because no contrast. Settings, i.e. ""high"" ""low"" etc., are in BLACK letters on the BLACK control panel."|Positive
Great product, quick delivery. Does the job of keeping out the cold and looks nice.|Positive
It cools the house very good. Was easy to install.|Positive
seams to work fine after the smell went away in about a week!|Positive
The sheet metal that was used is too thin I know it will rust faster that the old cooler. The unit is made very cheep. Not real happy with quality. I don’t know where to buy or who makes a cooler out of good quality materials....|Negative
Thought being a port a cool it wound be good for my shop. Was I wrong. Spit water everywhere and water adjustment did nothing. Taking it back|Negative
Review update: At 103 degrees outside this cooler has kept our 1400 square foot home between 76-79 throughout the day!|Positive
Trying this along with a new cover. My swamp cooler is large and I installed during a slight breeze. Wrong. Get someone to help, or at least use on a calm day. During first blast of winter, the product seemed to work well.|Positive
It cools very well and it is not so loud you can't talk. We have vents into several rooms from the swamp cooler so it provides excellent coverage on our main floor.|Positive
I replaced a 7500 pump on a residential Aerocool. The pump was running ok but no matter how I adjusted the distribution pipe above the pads I had dry columns on the pads. This pump definitely keeps my pads more thoroughly wet.|Positive
Cooler not cooling the entire house. Vents on all sides have been closed, but the living area is not cooling.|Negative
The fabric of the cover is much better than canvas cover. It is easier to work with. It fits like a glove.|Positive
The quality of this cover is very good. It even had a pull-cinch cord around the bottom to tighten.|Positive
This float valve works fine. I read about the complaints that it won't shut off, so I talked to the guy at home depot about it. He explained that to adjust the valve, you have to bend the rod that connects to the float. You bend it up or down to adjust it, then it shuts off without any problem.|Positive
Not bad for just a fan but not worth the price to cool. I understand the technology but the small warning about water is slightly understated. Tried the unit for 2 days. Left water all over the floor / carpet. Drained and checked water levels still large puddles and blows water around the room. I shot with a temperature gun and only 7 degrees cooler than ambient temperature. had to return unit.|Negative
Good product, heavy material and well made. Good price.|Positive
Seems to cool ok. Timer is great.|Positive
I bought 3 of these coolers, one was defective out of the box. Another worked for two days. When they work they work great.|Negative
"Can't recommend this item because the size is incorrect. Description says it has a 24"" OD but it is only 23.25"". Couldn't use for my application, too tight. Stamped correctly as a ""A22/4L240"" on the belt so maybe there is a manufacturing problem and they mixed up the belts and sizes. Regardless, waste of my time to order, wait for delivery, only have to return. Will not reorder this brand for fear of same result. Can't really comment on quality since I never used it which is why I gave it 3 stars (neutral). Good value but overall can't trust manufacturers sizing information.... time is money!"|Negative
easy to fit works very good I will buy it the next time I need to change the media|Positive
We purchased this cooler so that we wouldn't have to install in a window. It cools the room it was intended for, about 350 sq. feet w vaulted ceilings. Doesn't seem to cool other areas of the house which is fine. Completely worth the 235.00 I paid w free shipping. One con, it takes A LOT of water, about 40 galloons every 4 hrs.|Positive
"Used product for about a month now and we find it does a great job cooling our home in the low Arizona desert near Phoenix. I think the key in making it work well is to follow what the directions say....make sure you have some windows doors/open a bit to vent the humidity. We have a large open floor plan and in the past without running the A/C, by early evening, the room temp would easily get to the high 80's. We turn on the Ultracool high speed and we can get the room cooled down 5-8 degrees in less than an hour. By evening, the room temp is in the 70's while the outside temps are still in the 80's. The only negatives I can think of is we find the water level gauge to be unreliable/not accurate all of the time. The float seems to get ""stuck"" on ours. We also find the unit to be a bit loud on the high setting but running low speed or even mid, for the most part, we find the noise to be tolerable. In summary, we are glad we purchased the Ultracool and highly recommend it. It will definitely save us money on our energy bill. One last suggestion....*** Read the Manual and and follow the directions on placement/usage! ***"|Positive
I'm happy that I bought this evaporative cooler. It was worth the money and works well.|Positive
Good quality canvas and fits nicely. I am very pleased.|Positive
I worked assembling and used the infant model's of water cooler's in 1954, this new cooler's looks, construction, performance and ready to operate shipping, is beyond my imagination, I live in Tampico Mexico and in the hottest summer's day it keeps me cool and happy, wouldn't live one more day without it, it is the top's.|Positive
We have used this in the past to cover our septic tank for the winter. The last one we bought lasted us for 7-8 years but it started to tear due to rain and snow. It is bigger than what we need, but they do last and does a great job. We do recommend it.|Positive
Works good, could be built out of a little sturdier material but should function nicely as is.|Positive
The cover is made well and the installation was a breeze. This is the first winter for this cover so time will tell how well it stands up but so far I am very pleased with it.|Positive
$799 evaporated cooler. picked it up, brought it home. Fan just hummed, water pump worked but was spraying water inside but not down membrane, water level badge didn't work. Seriously upsetting. Took it back. $799 evaporated cooler, unbelievable.|Negative
GREAT PRICE ! FAST DELIVERY AND JUST WHAT ,IT SAID IN THE AD.|Positive
These don't last long, but the purchase is worth having for a fresh summer.|Positive
Doesn't cool as well as 30degrees as advertised|Negative
The cover slipped on easily & fits perfectly. Great quality.|Positive
The cover works just fine. We are satisfied with it. We give it an a|Positive
We have Central AC and a Window AC. We removed the window AC and put this swamp cooler in and I will never have to run my Central AC again this summer. We have a 2,200 sq. ft home and this cools off the entire home as long as you leave one of the windows open in a rear room so that the air will travel throughout the entire home. This is saving us $250 month on our monthly electricity bill. So it will definetley pay for itself after 2 mths. What is also nice about this cooler is that you can use it as a fan at night time when the air is cooler outside. It is like having central AC in your home but with a Breeze in the air as well. It's very cold air too! It's wonderful, it's a lifesaver. I recommend this product for any size home. This product pushes a lot of cold air through your home all day long and I don't have to worry about how much my electric bill is going to be anymore. Awesome Investment!!|Positive
does a good job on the patio. strong fan.|Positive
It fits our needs perfectly!!!!|Positive
Broke after first use. Not a quality belt even for the money|Negative
Pads last longer than the ones required by the metal coolers|Positive
Just fine..... Excellent service!! Thanks!|Positive
So far, Great Item! It works very quickly to cool down the house. The only (small) concern is the noise.Our house is basically an open floor plan so our living room is not far from where the cooler is installed. We have turned off the a/c!|Positive
Living near the beach in Orange County CA we haven't had a need for A/C. On the rare occasion that it got a little hot, fans did the trick. As the temps are rising we needed an alternative, Most of the traditional stores / online retail were either sold out or didn't have the right size. And the little stock left was WAY over priced. Through an online website we found this site and the product was not only the perfect size and attractive, it was reasonably priced. We go the order quickly it was exactly what we expected and works great. I recommend the company that sold it and the product itself. Everything went perfectly, we are VERY happy.|Positive
This is an awesome product. 2200 CFM is an enormous amount of air flow, and I love the oscillating louver. Also, it's very quiet. However, being an outdoor device, which I have unattended in my garden here in Phoenix, I do wish it had a timer.|Positive
cooler works really well. it cools down the room. but my only problem is that the fan is really noisy(high pitch).i bought this item a week ago. i'm going to call the company for a replacement.|Negative
Does a great job for our evaporative cooler. Replaced it after 6 years of use. Very happy.|Positive
Origonally i was a bit hesitant that this pump would move enough water for my portable mastercool unit, and turns out it works like a champ!|Positive
It works very well in our warehouse.|Positive
Powerful, cool, works excellent|Positive
Shipped on time, no issues. Easy to install and works great. Info in instructions for my specific cooler was vague, but was able to get it installed. Like other have said, there is a slight burnt smell for a couple of days.|Positive
Product works good. Just doesnt cool as well.|Negative
Hooked up easy and has worked great for 3 months now. Would recommend.|Positive
The product turned on and worked for approximately 20 seconds, then it broke. The fan motor stopped and the product was useless. Thank goodness Home Depot gave me my money back. Do not buy this product!!!|Negative
Doesn’t blow cool enough air|Negative
tested it out for about 3 weeks fan is strong didn't seem it was doing much Humidity range from 25 to 60... temp range from 80 to 110 during testing (California) ....tested doors full open half close 1/4 close... has wheels to move it around does NOT have any handles to pick it up ended up returning it|Negative
We needed an evaporative cooler for a bedroom. This works well for a small to medium sized bedroom. The fan is medium quiiet and blows a good amount of air. The whole top unit swings to redirect airflow. Adding water is a little tricky but doable.|Positive
It produces a horrible stench.|Negative
Don't be fooled. The item does not match the description. HD is selling AspenCool pads from China, NOT Dial pads from USA. These pads are slightly heavier than copy paper.|Negative
This product cools the area very well, is quiet and humidifies the air while cooling.|Positive
These floats seem to be VERY TEMPERMENTAL when adjusting water. The water would not shut off so I removed the float and blew into it at on and off levels. It did shut off just like it should but it wouldn't shut the water off in the cooler (no matter where I bent the rod). I spent over 20 minutes with it trying to make it work correctly. I was finally able to do it. The water adjustment is so tempermental that I couldn't believe it. One hair off making adjustments and you have a problem with it.|Negative
have been using this cooler for 1 month now works great. only 1 minor problem. the remote quit . replaced batteries twice. no go.called champion customer service and I have a new remote on the way.|Positive
every thing went as it was planned,|Positive
works as expected, and is quieter than compressor type|Positive
"It's a commodity product. Good or bad will be determined by how long it lasts. My last one from HD was the other (better) version from the same brand, and it only lasted two seasons, much worse than others I've had. I'm giving this one the benefit of the doubt and scoring it in the middle. I don't like that this brand lacks the built-in tee to connect your 1/4"" bypass/drain line. With our desert's mineral-saturated water, it's the only way to reduce massive incrustation of the pads. I had to go back and buy an in-line 1/2"" x 1/4"" tee to make that connection."|Negative
Very happy with all the ordering and shipping, very happy with the unit itself. Thank you.|Positive
"It's a drop in replacement in my swamp cooler! No need to change brackets, just pull the old one out, put the new one in, plug it in, and, for my issue, the flow was immediately better! I love it when parts just ""plug and play"" :)"|Positive
Received product, when opened box, 2 smaller pads are supposed to be same size, 1 larger pad size, received 2 larger size pads and 1 smaller pad. Had to improvise by cutting bigger size down to fit. Would have returned but, need to have cooler operational due to weather in triple digits.|Positive
It did the job purchased it for. The price is reasonable|Positive
I would have rated this beast 5 stars but there was a issue with a electric wire/cord inside the unit that has a keeper or clip that must have came loose or was not fastened to begin with. When I removed back panels to retrieve the casters that are located inside unit in water tank I did not notice insulated electric wire/cord that runs from control panel to the pump in water tank. Turns out this wire/cord was not clipped or fastened to the side panel and when I turned cooler on for first time I heard something that was not right and shut cooler off. I removed the back panels and seen that the fan was hitting the electric wire/cord and had stripped some insulation from the wire/cord. I repaired wire/cord with some electric tape and rigged cord so that there is plenty of clearance. There is no way the fan will hit cord now. Had this cooler been a item that was stocked in my local Home Depot I would have returned cooler and swapped it for another one. This was a online order and I would have had to box up the unit and return with a 3 week minimum turnaround time so I opted to do the repair. The pump will probably wear out before that electrical tape comes loose. The cooler does what it was designed to do very well. I live in the central valley in California. We have a dry heat here and evap coolers run best in low humidity heat and this cooler will pay for itself soon.|Positive
My kitchen and bedrooms are always warm and I needed some kind of cooler or air conditioner. This cooler does it job by providing a nice cool breeze and it definitely keeps the room (s) nice and cool.|Positive
The belt fit as expected|Positive
Cooler pad was a good fit! Will purchased these pads again.|Positive
Exactly what I needed to replace rusted out valve. Came as described and arrvied quickly.|Positive
This cooler is a great piece of equipment, excellent value only problem 1600 sq. ft. in apache junction AZ. in July no way I have a well insulated 1500 sq. ft. shop it helps but not as advertised if it did it would earn 10 stars|Positive
Use product in my business have central air but landlord won't upgrade ac unit and it's not large enough for the sq footage need extra cooling works great but downside is it a bit loud.|Positive
Fit the cooler perfect, haven’t had any issues with it coming loose or coming off and lately we’ve had some really bad weather and it’s still solid.|Positive
These straps are perfect for securing the cover over the evaporative cooler and prevent wind slapping the cover around. Now I can sleep on those blustery nights!|Positive
The day it arrived was over a hundred degrees. Within 15 minutes it was ready o go. In about an hour, the room was10 degrees lower. It is fairly quiet easy to move around.|Positive
This product is great for a small bedroom/office. Really does get cold and cool of the room. Glad we bought it.|Positive
Give it a 6 out of 10, these models seem to last one season. the bearings or impellers seem to freeze up. Imagine if they would make one that lasted 2 or three seasons. they'd own the market!!|Negative
The ONLY reason it doesn't get a 5 -star rating on Overall Value is because it arrived with a broken ground pin on the electrical plug, which had to be replaced.|Positive
excellent quality, quiet, runs like a top.'|Positive
Was not good for Atlanta humidity, better dry heat after reading about product.|Negative
pleased with the price and availability good product for the price would buy again|Positive
Bought a MasterCool MP44 last summer and was not happy with how loud unit was on low. After reading reviews on the Bonaire Durango decided to fork out another $500 on trying to get a cooler that I could be happy with hopefully for years to come. The Bonaire is considerably quieter on the low setting so that I can hear my TV or my stereo at a normal volume. Also like that the Bonaire has a switch to change unit from remote controls to manual. With the MasterCool I was not able to plug it in to a timer as it was only remotely controlled. Now I can set the timer to have the cooler come on a couple hours before I get home so that the house is nice and cool. Also really like the snap on front fins that will enable you to direct air flow rather than just having air blow straight out the front. The MasterCool put out an unpleasant odor for the first 10-15 minutes after sitting idol for any time. Have not noticed this with the Bonaire. I think both units cool very well but the Bonaire is quieter. The Bonaire has a purge line directly off the feed line for the water cycling to pads rather than having to use a purge pump as we did with the MasterCool. So far, really like this unit.|Positive
Recommend a evaporative portable cooler from home Depot|Positive
nice and it makes a difference|Positive
Great for my garage and back patio!|Positive
Fit good easy to install|Positive
It's good overall.|Negative
Although I find the pads a good width and fit and would order again, I did not like the way they were packed all folded up. Unfolding the pads was rather messy but once I had them in place which is harder to do with the creases they worked out well.|Positive
Cooler performed as expected. Is quiet and cools the bedroom very well.|Positive
could not put out any cool air in a room 110 square feet|Negative
Fabulous Product. Highly recommend. Great as bedside cooler.|Positive
Very nice product. I wish it could have the beeping alarm instead of only flashing when low on water level.Other than that it’s awesome product.|Positive
Searched everywhere for a replacement cover for large swamp cooler. Found this at HomeDepot.com and decided to give it a try. Fit is perfect and easy to install and remove.|Positive
I've used some cheaper brand evaporative coolers over the years, but they were the type that just got me by in the summer months. My bedroom happens to get the warmest in the house, so even with the A/C in the house running, the bedroom is the hot spot that I have difficult cooling. Realized that my old Fujitronic model was on its last legs, so I started researching Honeywell models since I've got one of their humidifiers and two of their air purifiers and they've been solid products. I was actually going to buy a smaller sized Honeywell evaporative cooler since all I needed was one that worked with 200 SQ-FT, but thought I'd rather be on the side of having more than enough rather than too little, so I came across this model. The most important point with these evaporative coolers is that for them to work, you better live in a dry climate. These coolers are a waste if you live in a humid climate. They just become a glorified fan. Fortunately, I live in the desert where these units thrive. This one happens to be quite powerful and noisy and uses quite a bit of water, but boy does it work. The water usage can be reduced with turning a valve, but that also reduces the cooling effect. I have it now set at about 40-50% capacity. In the beginning, it was dialed to 3/4 and I could go through an entire 8 Gallon tank in 12 hours. The thing I like about this unit is the bottom end detaches from the top making it easy to dump stagnant and heavy mineral water in the tub that can clog up the pump and reduce its efficiency. The manual says do a cleanout once a week which I highly advise based on my experience with evaporative coolers and hard water. Since I've only owned this for 72 hours, I can't speak of its reliability, but it's built pretty solid and anything that needs to be cleaned to keep it working at its best can be accessed with either a star screwdriver for the honeycomb filter ( manuals says clean twice or three times a year ) or easy detachment of the water storage for dumping and cleaning the tub. 8 gallons is quite a bit of water and if you're filling it with a large jug, it still can take some time, so if you get easily annoyed at having to fill something once or maybe even twice a day if you're running it 24 hours, then an evaporative cooler might be too much work for you. For me, this honeywell cooler works really well. For all the effort required to keep it running, if how it works is the payoff, then I can't praise it enough. Yes, it's more money that I was originally going to pay. Yes, it's noisy, yes it uses water at a faster rate than I was expecting, but the big thing that matters is it really works well and will be invaluable during those summer months when the A/C will be running at peak capacity. 5 star product. Hope the reliability is 5 star also.|Positive
Works great in my 2 car garage. Much more comfortable on a 90 degree day. Fan does make some noise but is acceptable. Easy to assemble, just pop in the wheels, add water and plug it in.|Positive
I have it in a 1,600sf shop and it does the job. If you use the hose attachment make sure you adjust the float. The media hampers the float movement and will overflow the unit if not adjusted. Great unit for the price and I’m sure on hot days it will be a fixture on the back patio.|Positive
We replaced an old rusted out cooler with this one. Not only is it smaller than the old one, it's quite a bit quieter as well. It isn't super quiet, but not loud either. Does a good job cooling the upper level of our house- 3 bedrooms. Would recommend, especially with the rebate from the utility provider, made the net cost just over $150|Positive
Replaced another similar size from the same manufacturer. Pretty easy to install. Works fine.|Positive
I have enjoyed this machine|Positive
Works perfectly. A little time consuming to hook up. not a simple plug in and go, actually have to do a little wiring.|Positive
It doesn't cool as much as I expected, but it certainly moves the air around. I stand right in front of it to use my lathe, and it does the job.|Negative
The straps were long enough to go completely around my evaporative unit and they are quality buckles and weaving, which should last for many years. Easy to assemble and secure the cover to the cooler|Positive
It was a perfect fit for our swamp cooler. And it's made of a rugged material to with stand the strong winds|Positive
Didn't care for the alternating sleep mode. One steady mode is best. .unit is awesome otherwise. .|Positive
After waiting 10 days for it to be delivered to my local store ,I never even plugged the thing in .I took it home to put it together and after a quick inspection found that it had never been completely assbled at the factory.|Negative
Works 100 times better than the broken one. :)|Positive
Works great, good material, should last for a while. I used it to upgrade a portable cooler that used a mesh screen for evaporation. I bought that model cooler because it was cheap but the design (mesh screen) wasn't efficient at all and it had poor cooling properties. I took it apart and replaced the Mesh Screen with the Rigid Media above and now my 89.00 dollar cheap cooler works like my 200.00 Kuul-Aire. All it took was a Phillips screw driver and a hacksaw blade to cut the Media to the proper size. For a 10.00 upgrade, I'm very happy withe the results. I've been using that little cooler now for over a month or so and it works great.|Positive
Fits just right.|Positive
Excellent pump for 220V, which is stated clearly on the package. Easy installation and works great.|Positive
I have had this cooler for about 2 months now. I use it to cool down my garage(1200 sq ft). I works well even when the temps are hitting the triple digits. I like the option to have a hose hooked up or not.|Positive
Works in small spaces|Negative
Good quality material and construction, happy with purchase.|Positive
"This cover is exactly what I needed and there were no surprises. The cover fits great because I ordered the 36x36x36 for my cooler which is 34x34x34. The 2"" overlap gives me a great fit and there's no buffeting sounds when the wind blows. The cover does not have a bad odor as reported in other reviews. There was a little bit of odor which went away after I unwrapped the cover and let it air out in the shed for a few days."|Positive
Please tell me how I am supposed to close the side with rectangular eyelets and a piece of string. I will return this ASAP as it is absolutely unusable with the side flapping open.|Negative
the product was an epic fail in all respects. very sorry but we were very disappointed with this product and immediately returned it.|Negative
Had this cooler a couple of weeks and so far so good! I bought it to help cool my 230 sq ft sunroom where my cats live. The unit is quite solid and rolls easily even when full. The casters were a bit difficult to push in - rubber mallet works well! Definitely is more effective using chilled water and ice - my tap water is just too warm. I have it in front of an open door with the other door slightly ajar. Most of the time it's running on high and I'm adding water every 2 - 3 hrs. I don't mind because it does keep the room tolerable, but you have to put it on before it gets too hot otherwise it won't work - it's not an air conditioner. Bottom line: it keeps the room 10 - 15 degrees cooler than outside and 15 - 20 degrees cooler than what it would be without it. Me and the cats are happy with that!|Positive
Covers are excellent quality and easy to put on, sturday and weather resistant.|Positive
I have two downdraft coolers, both the same size and I started having those 8 pads shipped to my house to save from digging thru the pile at the store.They work perfectly and I use them for two years before changing.|Positive
seams to fit ok, it tightens with a draw string, and the point of closure seams to be too big, it closes before it is tight over the unit.|Negative
The straps work like you would expect.|Positive
Bought this Cover for my Roof cooler since its in a good shape and well maintained, Im satisfied with the ease of installing,even though I could not get the exact size for my cooler I worked it in nice. Then added some Nylon tie Downs for added wind protection.|Positive
Easy to install and true to the specs given for the model I bought. Amazing how much more efficient the new pads are compared to my older ones.|Positive
The evaporator cooler motor clamps are very durable and sturdy . It's nice that they're such high quality. I'm sure they must be rust resistant. Very easy to install.|Positive
Perfect size, Long enough string to tie, Strong material, Durable stitching, Correct design, Unparalleled protection.|Positive
I gave this cooler to a friend, she LOVES it! The cool air and ambient sound of the fan lull her to sleep every night! (Thanks to Ashley Simpson for asking.)|Positive
Missing parts had to jury rig . As 2 items were missin.|Negative
Overpriced fan|Negative
We tried 3 times to get an undamaged product. Each time there was a dent in a corner of the media set. The outer papers on each one of the 3 sets flaked off when removing it from the box. We ultimately had to have UPS pick up and return. We are still waiting for a refund of $30.71 of the $122.84 we spent on this item. Not happy at all.|Negative
These past weeks I've notice my cooler not getting cold enough and just now my pump gave out....as of 7/19/2018|Negative
It fits very good and made of great quality fabric. Very nice|Positive
"The item came fully assembled. The remote holder on the side of the unit is handy, but the remote itself is hard to read, as the background color on it is almost as dark as the lettering. Its easy to wheel around, as it has five wheels. The door which you open to fill it with water seems flimsy. I've read other reviews about the smell it emits. When I first ""fired it up"", I could see what they were talking about. I figured it was the smell coming from the filter. I sprayed one spray of ""Haiku"" (Avon scent), into the compartment where you put the ice, and the melting ice which dripped onto the filter brought the scent into the filter. I did this maybe the first two or three times I used it, and no longer have any smell problem. I love that the fan oscillates. It broadcasts the cool air back and forth across the room. It also has louvers which will direct the air up or down. It definitely can keep the air in my home in the low to mid 70's while it is in the high 90's outside. In fact, when it gets too cold in here, I just turn it off. It has 3 speeds, but I generally just keep it on low speed. I think that the more humidity in the air from the unit, the less efficiently it works, so I did purchase a de-humidifier, which I only turn on when it gets too humid in here. I don't have it on too often. The unit is somewhat noisy, but I would compare it with the sound of a fan, as that is what propels the cool air into the room. I just turn up the sound on the TV. If you think about it, even A.C. can be noisy. I have it in my ""great room"" (liv. room, dining and kitchen) (vaulted ceilings) and it does the job for me. Wouldn't want to get through the summer without it."|Positive
We use this product when we go to bed. It does a fair job cooling our room for about 3-4 nights but then it drastically gets weaker. Constantly have to clean to provide algae buildup/mold. Also, have to put ice cubes in the tank to make it actually cool|Negative
It fits and we're already warmer. I'm happy with my purchase.|Positive
It cools well and moves a lot of air, but we bought it for a bedroom and unless you can sleep with a train in your room, this is not the unit for you. we returned ours, during a heat wave and we do not have another unit to replace it yet. it's that unusable, for us.|Negative
This was a good cooler for the first two years. At the end of this season, this cooler is all of two years old and is beginning to rust and the coating to break down. The last cooler I had did not start to rust until it was more than 10 years old. Champion has gone cheap on the rust prevention and on the cooler coating. The motor mount is completely rusted. Quality is awful. I live in Colorado with 10% humidity this should not rust this soon in the high desert.|Negative
This cover was a perfect fit. I only wish I would have bought it last year because I had the cold air coming in from outside all winter. What a difference this cover made. I just love it.|Positive
I have to say that it's great living in a place where these things work so well. We are in Reno and are normally below 5% humidity. The 100 degree days were far too much for our AC to keep up with. This cooler is great. You just throw on the wheels and fill it full of water and it's good for about 8 hours of refreshment. I stumbled into a sale and picked it up for $251 here and couldn't be happier.|Positive
Yes but installation take time to gets extra parts like support legs and roof draft jack|Positive
This product was a lifesaver this Summer!|Positive
Well made and easy to install.|Positive
My evaporative cooler in the greenhouse is running again and keeping things cool.|Positive
Straps work great. Wish I had these years ago. Works real well with the cover. The cover has a nice velcro seam that does a good job of sealing out the weather. The straps finish the job by tying everthing in place.|Positive
Was very easy to assemble|Positive
It offers a lot of options. It is great for the price! I am still learning the functions and options on it. I have only used it for 3 days and I like it so far.|Positive
Product stands up in all kinds of winter weather.|Positive
I move this unit between rooms, it can get loud but it doe help alleviate the heat to a tolerable temp.|Positive
Works well|Positive
Durable product . Should come in other colors like Military Green and Brown|Positive
Good fan, quiet. Evaporator/cooler does not really work. I live in a dry environment and thought it would help cool the bedroom at night. The evaporator didn't make a difference. but the fan is quiet and swings so that helped.|Negative
Do not use these. Stick with OEM from Durango. Developed dry (hot) spots. Went back to OEM and no hot spots.|Negative
I returned product. It leaked and the power switch did not work properly.|Negative
Decided to buy a second evap cooler unit for my home (our first is a sturdy metal body -love it). Assembly wasn't bad. Upon filling w/ water it leaked from 3 separate places on my hardwood floors. Returned it that day =(|Negative
This is a handy air cooler to have to move right where you are working. It is fully portable and carries it's own water supply if needed. Water supply can also be provided with a hose adapter that is included. The cooler puts out a great volume of cooled air. There are three speeds to choose from. There is also a rotate feature that allows the vanes to oscillate up and down while the unit is one. The casters let you move the unit around easily. The unit has easy to remove and install filters for cleaning. When summer is over, the water is easily drained out and the inside is easily accessed by removing the back to clean out for storage. The unit comes with a remote control and also has a low water alarm. there is a side view to review the water level as well. Great aur cooler.|Positive
The motor functions properly, restored my swamp cooler. However, there is a loud 60-Hz buzz that is audible outside as well as anywhere near the vents throughout the house. I tried it a few days, but it did not let up. Online I see similar comments about this motor. The old one did not make such noise. I had to go online, as every retail place in town carries this same motor. Got another brand today, installed it, no noise. Returned this Dial brand to HD for full refund.|Negative
using it as a cooler in my garage. so far so good. The cooler takes a minute to get going but definately glad we put it in. good on dry hot days but not so well on humid days.|Positive
Impossible to remove if you ever need to replace it. Pulley puller or no, this thing corrodes and permanently melds to your motor shaft.|Negative
I ordered the NewAir because of the positive reviews on it. One of the positive things mentioned was how quiet it was. Ours worked just fine when we just had the fan on but once we ran it with the cooler it had a very noisy irregular pattern. Also, the (unlocked) drawer was very hard to remove. The box it came in had one small and one large punched hole in it so there is a good chance that ours got damaged in the transport although we didn't notice any physical damage to the unit. We returned it with no problem.|Negative
It is a nice looking product and it is easy to use. But 1) it has four small plastic casters which work fine as long as there is no water in the cooler and your not on carpet then the casters as just to small to work properly. 2) The small door on the side of the cooler is large enough to pour a gallon of water into the unit but not large enough to pour a bag of ice into the reservoir, which is the only way you actually get cooled air. Nor is the water flow opening large enough to hold more than an ice cub tray of ice cubs. 3) As far as cooling area, maybe 100 sqft. If there was just some way to place a 10lb bag or block of ice in the unit it would do a lot better job. The small little 4in square access door where you pour in the water is just not conducive for adding ice to the unit accept in very small amounts.|Negative
This is the right size and volume for the average home garage. If you live in an area that has low humidity, this is a must for those who work in there garage every weekend on their toys! I live in the Mojave Desert, and when it's 116 deg F in the daytime. I finally found something to keep my toy box tolerable. This is a GREAT product.|Positive
Fine.|Positive
This was an easy repair. The instructions for wiring were very clear and the physical size was exactly what was required to make the installation seamless.|Positive
Thus product was out in our concessions stand. The night we put it up, the night was a hit. The employees were cool all night in 107 degree weather|Positive
"Easy to ""assemble""--unscrew back screen, add included filters, screw back on. Easy, though tedious, to fill with pitchersful of water. Not as cooling as I had hoped, but it definitely makes a difference. Instruction to add ice cubes in order to get cooler temps is a bit lame. Nice features: three speeds, oscillation, and fan-only option. May take some time to moisten the cardboard that the air flows through; consider keeping it running, even at slowest speed, to keep the cardboard moist. Seems sturdy so far. Kind of looks like a red R2D2--good conversation piece. Really helps breathing during hot, dry, smoky fire season."|Positive
The motor was very easy to install and connect. Both speeds were available. The major issue with this motor is the loud vibrating hum it emits when it is on. Way too distracting and not pleasant to listen to. Even had to raise the volume of the television to hear it when the cooler was on!|Negative
This works better than my AC! I am not joking, I run my whole house air conditioning for 30 minutes and it can't get it to 75 when it's about 95 out. I turn this puppy on and it gets it down to a nice comfortable 70 degrees within about 10 minutes! But check your drain line weekly. It should have a nice good little spray to it. Mine turned to a drip for who knows how long and now I need to buy a new filter because the minerals built up faster than they should have, and it's not cooling as effectively. It took about 7 months of use for the drain line to go from a spray to a drip. If you check the drain line once a week to make sure it's a spray, you can make your cooling pads last probably up to 3 years, now i have to replace mine because the drain line clogged from my bad high mineral water. The savings and the more comfortable humid air are still far worth the comparison vs. AC. My electric bill was 150 dollars a month in the summer, now it's 30 dollars, no joke. But check your drain line every week to keep saving this money, otherwise you have to buy a new pad every year which is 100 dollars. But keep in mind that if your drain line gets clogged, you still save major bucks and have more breathable and water filtered air.|Positive
Excellent product. Keeps our 1100 sq ft house at 72 deg when it is 101 degrees outside|Positive
I have several of these evaporative coolers for greenhouses and they last for years. Because this new one was going to be used in a shop window up high I decided to get it with the remote control. You can't use this model with a thermostat or a timer!!! I didn't see anything in the literature that indicates that. Since it was already installed and hard to get down I had to pay an electrician to bypass the remote control in order to use it.|Negative
Works great surprise plenty of water to the pads|Positive
I purchased this evaporated cooler for a friend to use because her air conditioner was broken I love it,I've sat in her house and it is so nice and cool she loves me to death for it but I wasn't gonna let her burn up in the heat I recommend it to anybody to purchase one .great indoors so you know it has to be great outdoors as well .thank you very much Home Depot|Positive
I love it, been wanting one for a while.|Positive
They were a perfect fit and arrived sooner than expected.|Positive
Easily cools 1,000 house on low speed when in the upper 90s outside. Actually turned if off early in the evening ....... too cool in the room it's installed in!! Needs dry climate.|Positive
Cooler pump works just fine. The gallons per thing does not mean anything to me either it works or it does not. Do not through out that old cooler the HOME DEPOT has everything to rebuild it at a fraction of new. I have three of these pumps and they all work just fine its 90 to 100 in Reno.|Positive
They don't filter air!|Negative
I've had Mastercool coolers for twenty five years and they have been very reliable. This cooler was picked up at Home Depot in an undamaged box, but when I opened it up I discovered both access panels bent and the front right side panel also pushed in and bent. I waited an extra week beyond the forecasted delivery date for a damaged unit. I was not impressed.|Negative
There was a gash in the box as delivered and the electric cord was partly sliced. There was also a molding defect in the plastic housing. I needed the cooler in order to work in my garage at the time it arrived so I didn't send it back. It works like it is supposed to.|Negative
The cooler is a good one. Same as the old one that I kept working for 25 years. This one works great but was damaged when I opened it up at home. Couldn't see damage when I picked it up. I straitened it out best as I could and installed it as I had arranged help to install it.|Negative
Best V-belt that you can buy and depend on, wouldn't use any other brand.|Positive
Worked as a perfect replacement. Running w24/7 for about 6 weeks now.|Positive
"Maybe one star is not fair, but it did not work with my cooler. My old ""6-point"" controller was lacking one wire to make it all work. I found this out after paying a handyman $50 to hook it up... or try to. I had to return it. I can't afford to pay to rewire my evaporative cooler from the roof down."|Negative
Had this unit professionally installed last month. Cools well but makes a lot of extra noise. It pulse squeaks very loud like it is in desperate need of oil and/or it going to fall apart. No way you can fall asleep with it running. Now I have to pay someone to come and try to fix the problem so I don't have to replace it.|Negative
I am very pleased with my new portable cooler. We were looking for something for our living room and it rolls nicely into the bedroom at night. Features are great and works with little effort. Very quiet and more than what I expected (comparing to another I had in the home).|Positive
Was ease to putting together, give a plus excellent 5 star|Positive
small room cooler only. I live in desert and evaporater coolers work here, this unit is quiet for its size and seems towork as listed.|Negative
Doesn't cool as much as I would like|Negative
This is supposed to make a small room feel many degrees cooler. It does not. I would say it feels more like a regular fan, and maybe one degree cooler than without it.|Negative
"I purchased this evaporative cooler pump to replace the one I purchased ONE year ago when our HVAC guy serviced our swamp cooler. Our handyman did the service this year as he has one just like ours at his home. He thought the pump was acting a little ""glitchy"" and recommended we prime it for 10-15 minutes before turning the swamp cooler completely on with the blower.Sure enough, it kept seizing up. My sister's son in law checked, and it wasn't working. He tapped on it, and it started, but not for long - hence the replacement., I am sure this is a fine product as far as pumps go. I think I just got a lemon."|Negative
love it|Positive
It fit nicely!!!!|Positive
No it was dented on top corner, reordered still waiting was suppose to come in 7/27/18.|Negative
I wrote a very favorable reveiw 7 months ago but I must take it back. When it worked it was great but it died before the 1st hot season was over. It was so disappointing, the control panel went haywire. It said it was empty even though It was full of water. I was faithful with the monthly cleaning of the unit & I loved the fact that when the water got low it would shut off the pump so it wouldn't burn out but unfortunately it is a $200 box fan now. What a piece of junk!|Negative
This pump was easy to install and works just as it should.|Positive
This product makes a HUGE difference in the cool air that drops from the vent on the swamp cooler. Fits snug and I noticed they come in different sizes. Hides nicely in the duct and the material looks as though it will hold up for many years. GREAT FIND|Positive
I have always shopped at Home Depot and the belt for my evaporative cooler is exactly what I needed and very durable.|Positive
I wish the top part could be deeper for more ice cubes and part should be wider too.|Negative
This is a stylish and quality cooling unit. I was excited to receive it and get it opened. It was lightweight and discretely fits in each room of my home. The remote control feature allows me to control it while I am lying in bed, which is so convenient. It does not take long to cool a room down. I cannot wait to use it during the hot summer days.|Positive
It works properly, I will see if it last the summer. The previous unit lasted 3 months in-spite of a water filter, anode rod and demineralizer packs.|Negative
I ordered it on line. Got it home it was missing four slats. They made me order another one. I don't think I will ever get all my money back. Check it before you leave them store.|Negative
Only thing it ever did was raise the humidity. xxxx|Negative
Appliance works very well and I am happy with it....|Positive
These install easily and fit perfectly (Bonaire Durango). 30$ cheaper than OEM. Tried aspen and other materials as replacements. These are the ticket. I have 3 bonaire durango swampers and have used these in all three for the past three years. ✌️|Negative
Good stuff.|Positive
This unit really pumps out the cold air in a hot garage. Water consumption is a little fast on high, so keep a bucket around for refills on hot days.|Positive
Evaporative cooler Here in SE Arizona with temps breaking records, we wanted this cooler before the heat set in. We have a larger area than the 250 sq. ft. to cool so we were not expecting great coolness. Yet if we are within its vicinity it does cool. We are grateful for any relief.|Negative
Works wonderfully. Very happy with this so far it has worked great.|Positive
fit my champion cooler had to order this item online could not get the right size locally and had to use ones that were too small last year the cooler is working great with these pads|Positive
It works as expected. Great price.|Positive
Works really well at our 6500 square foot unit.. We have 2 large garage doors on an industrial building that we keep open the entire time the unit is running. Works very well|Positive
This cooler is easy to install and it works well. No complaints!|Positive
This size is difficult to find, and the price was great/|Positive
I have been so happy with my purchase. Keep smy living room cool I enjoy that the louvers turn and not the entire unit. I enjoy the nature mode the best. The noise it a bit stronger than what I thought but not unbearable at all|Positive
Fit perfectly cooler running so much better now love the on line shopping|Positive
So far so good. This unit has met all expectation and doing the job|Positive
Great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|Positive
this cooler works even better than we expected. I'd highly recommend it.|Positive
Nice product Fast delivery|Positive
I was expecting the canvas cover to be the same heavy weight canvas as the previous covers I have had. This one is a lightweight canvas. Time will tell if it is as good.|Negative
"The pads fit perfectly with no messy cutting, installed easily with the cooler in place. Ideal solution for the ""tiny"" cooler conundrum."|Positive
Output not enough for my space. Only covers 250 sq feet. I need a larger unit.|Negative
This unit was so easy to install and it literally cooled the house down in minutes! So years later, in another house, when I had the need to buy an evaporative cooler I knew exactly what I wanted, a Bonaire! I have had this one for 3 years now and it still works great. My son just bought the same design but the Lowe's brand is a Master Cool. Well, 4th day of using it there is still a strange strong odor coming from the unit that fills the whole house. I am recommending to him to return the Master Cool and drive further to a Home Depot to purchase a Bonaire. The Bonaire is Australian made and is much better quality The only regret is Bonaire does not have replacement pads or parts in store and today's shipping costs are a factor when maintenance is required. So, I encourage Home Depot to carry Bonaire pads and parts, even if by order to the store. are a factor|Positive
We have had this fan for 3 years and it has been a life saver. You do have to make sure you have good room circulation, as with any swamp cooler. Love putting ice cubes in the bottom.|Positive
Easy install. Knew that it would be hot the next day, so let it run on low all night then turned fan to high about 9am. At 3pm the outside temperature was 100, the inside temperature was 72. Only had the unit for a month so not sure how long it will last.|Positive
Not so gooddefinitely doesn't drop 20 to 30° temperature it doesn't work very good at all I'm almost thinking of sending it back it does add moisture to the air which is a good thing but is far is cooling not worth it's weight not very good|Negative
Worked great and now I can adjust the speed of the blower.|Positive
good design; fits perfectly, canvas coated in a water-proof coating to preserve fabric.|Positive
Easy to install, however the bracket is not included. I had to improvise by using tie wrap to hold it to the frame of cooler|Positive
Great service from all your people|Positive
Does the job for the older models of Mastercool!|Positive
"This unit is a solid product. It replaced the same unit that we purchased over 10 years ago. That is saying something, because the average life of a swamp cooler around here is 5 years due to our ""dirty"" power and hard water. Also, the price was 50% cheaper than anywhere else. The service I received from Home Depot left a lot to be desired, but this review is about the swamp cooler."|Positive
Very easy to set up and use. Needs a humidity controller to plug into if used indoors|Positive
I have only used this product on fan. So, I can't yet write a review on the cooling function. I've felt that the fan has done such a wonderful job (& we even had one day where it was 92 degrees); that I haven't even tried the ice pack & water in the lower compartment. When I do, I'll up date. It's easy to move/the remote stores easily right in the built in handle/it's attractive looking/and it WORKS !! Well, worth the money, I'd say.|Positive
Nice looking small cooler that is made for a small room and doesn't take up much space. Everything on it operates as the description. I don't think it needs a remote when in a small space it's easy to touch the controls on top of the unit.|Positive
It is a very bulky poor built fan that is quite loud. It does blow maybe 10 degrees cooler but the air forced through it is weak and not worth the price. Did not nearly meet expectations.|Negative
Easy to use and have stayed in place.|Positive
My last one lasted 3 seasons hope 1 does as well|Positive
Basically a good cooler cover, but it has a slit on one side with offset plastic rings that make for a clunky closure. I service 10 coolers each season and am pretty good with ropes and knots. In my opinion this is a nonsensical design. If it did not have a corner opening, this would be a terrific cover.|Negative
Not to write. It's nice and is doing its job.|Positive
Works well.. ! Saves my bacon when my trailer gets hotter than the outside 95 degrees and more!|Positive
Bought this to keep me cool while working in the garage during the hot Texas Summers !!! With the garage door open, it does not cool down the garage, but it puts out enough cool air that it feels good while working in front of it. It is light weight and on wheels, which makes it easy to change where I want it. This was excellent value and I would do it again, knowing what I know now.|Positive
Personally I thought it was awful. Made the house even hotter. Felt muggy, sticky. It is way over priced for what it is worth.|Negative
This cooler designed for 1650 sq ft works much, much less well than the Champion cooler for 900 sq ft that it replaced. Buyers really need to know that the replacement pads for these coolers stink like they are toxic, and give off odors that pervade the house for days or weeks. Google all the complaints online.... I wish I had my old Champion....|Negative
The dial stopped working after trying to turn the dial to OFF. Cheap product.|Negative
You people complaining about the CFM. This is a once thru unit, you cannot ciculate through an evaporative cooler. In order for it to blow air in, you have to provide for air to blow out. Open a window across the house enough that you feel the air slowly leaving the house. If you close up your house this unit will not work. Also you have to be somewhere dry, like less than 20% RH on the hot days. And if your night RH rises to 70% it might not do much through the night, just use a regular fan then.|Negative
Beware: Belt broke in less than 1 year for use on furnace blower! Left me without heat one very cold winter's night. Other brands have lasted many, many times longer. Look else where for needed reliability in northern climates.|Negative
Have to oil part every several days, bushing should be oil light bronze. Believe it to be only brass. I may be mistaken, but i doubt it.|Negative
Did it's job|Positive
Easily installed and working perfectly. Would be nice to purchase in store, rather than pay shipping charges.|Positive
It's fairly light weight , & once you get it on the roof-, you can walk it to the place you want to put it , &,. It seems to be cooling a lg house really well|Positive
What a great item to use when I didn't want to turn on the AC unit. Cools a bedroom nicely.|Positive
Ive had this unit for 3 summers now and its cools 1/2 my house.Its great even just using the fan,love the timer,large water tank. I put near open window and my house is frozen!! Our water is really hard and all the parts havent busted or broke, I drain water at the end of season,clean insides and thats it. The only thing I dont like is taking it apart you can lose some skin on your knuckles;just wish it was easier.|Positive
Cooler cover fit just fine.|Positive
This cooler has helped a great deal already. Our house gets exceptionally hot, especially in the livingroom. I use this unit to cool the air and then use peripheral fans to blow the cool air throughout the room. I know the unit has an oscillator, but it started to make a clicking noise so decided it was best to use the fans which helps tremendously. I have also blocked off open doorways in order to keep the cool air in the room. It really does the job! I did have some problems with leakage from underneath the drain. I McGyvered it though and it is not hardly leaking at all now. It is important to know that you must have an open door or window behind the unit AND an open door or window on the other side of the room for it to be the most effective. It works great and am looking forward to a cooler more comfortable summer this year.|Positive
It works very well for the price. It is very affordable.|Positive
"Worked great but for ""water gauge"" on the front of the unit. It shows full before filled, after filled, and after several hours of use (must be stuck). This doesn't prevent it from working/cooling, just doesn't let you prepare for refilling (at least it ran for 3+ hours and didn't need refilling)."|Positive
This evap cooler really delivers cool air if you keep the reservoir filled! Used it over the 4th of July weekend and the house stayed comfortable despite the 103 degree outside temperature. If I had known these coolers were this efficient, I would have purchased one several years ago! It is a purchase you won't regret.|Positive
pump works well. We use them for our A/C business on small home coolers. If properly maintained they last 3 or 4 seasons|Positive
This cooler has been the biggest headache since purchase. It works well when it's all set up but you need two people, lots of time and appropriate outlets for anger. The product is plastic so it flexes with every movement and needs to line up perfectly to put the cover back on. The water line attaches to the float inside the cooler, which will rotate with your wrench requiring you to take apart the cooler just to replace the water line. It's also just awkwardly shaped. If you live alone you will end up breaking the plastic attempting the align the backing with the front secondary to shape and flex of the plastic. Trust me, you want metal and square!|Negative
Perfect fit.|Positive
Poorly packed product for shipping No store in the Las Vegas area did not stock filters and would not order stock Had to go to Lowes to buy was in very good packaging and there was no damage|Negative
Cover dimensions and specs were correct as ordered. Easy to install.|Positive
I purchased the large unit less than a year ago and motor went out. Returned for new unit and in less than a week, that motor went out. Exchanged for two of these smaller units and one unit was missing parts and would not run. Second unit was okay. These are high priced plastic junk boxes.|Negative
I have had this unit for a little over a year now. It works great but as some of the other reviews have said it is not the best quality. The water sensor was backwards and now has fallen off. The knob you turn to change what you are using comes off with basically a stiff breeze. So you ask why the five star rating? Because those issues don't mean anything. This beast works and is sooooo much cheaper than the units competing against it. I have never had a problem with the functionality of it. I have not been ultra kind to it either. I have left it in the elements and every time I turn it on it works great. I would definitely buy again and I probably will get another one soon. As a side note if you can afford it always go with a size bigger. The listed cooling area (for all these type fans) is just not realistic. I use this unit for about 25 x 25 deck and it does great. I am in Georgia where it is basically like siting on the sun so other areas may be closer to the listed coverage area.|Positive
"Came assembled and ready to go. UPS damaged the box, but it was packaged very well and no damage to the unit. Instructions were easy to follow. It cooled the room where we needed it the most. Worked wonderfully!! Would recommend putting the ""water tablets for no smelly smells"" into the tank, as sometimes the water can get skanky when the cooler is not in use. I wish it was a little bit easier to drain the water out of the holding tank when you need to put it away for the winter."|Positive
Simple and fit just right|Positive
It came together well|Positive
Great|Positive
I really like this because you have options such as the oscillating fan and ability to add ice to make it colder on those hot days it's a little loud when on high speed my dogs were a little afraid at first but got use to it once they realized they could lay in front of it to cool off I really think that I made a great investment on these|Positive
Works great well pleased with the purchase.|Positive
We use this unit for a kickboxing gym, 3000sf with high ceiling. Tried a couple of other units, no comparison. This thing is a beast. It isn't very loud and the fans....wow....they rock......really rock. Louvers are great and we use it with other fans. Does it pump cold air.....big time. Super impressed, made the porta cool look like a toy. Great product that uses little energy.|Positive
I purchased this because I have emergency window in my room and it was not solving my problem because as much it cools, the heat from from exhaust pipe makes it normal. In the end my room never gets cool,but it is just better from outside.|Negative
This is a nice portable evap cooler. It doesn't quite do the job I wanted here in Arizona, but helps keep the heat down. I was expecting it to drop the temp. down about 20 - 25 degrees and instead get somewhere between 10 - 12. When the outside temp. reaches 110 - 115, I use a 10 lb. bag of ice a day, which is costly. Overall, it works good, not too noisy, and if you have it on when your sleeping, the pump shuts off when the water runs out but the fan keeps working. I would imagine it would work great in a part of the country where the heat isn't as extreme as it is here in Southern Arizona.|Positive
We purchased the MasterCool 3200 CFM Slim Profile Window Evaporative Cooler for our Las Vegas garage. It works great! The installation went quickly with the instructions being clear and concise. The unit is quiet and we really like the slim profile. Highly recommend!|Positive
I am in South California. The cooler has the following features that I like: Good design, mobile, easy filling, large water tank with level indicator, 3-speed strong fan with fan/cold selectable, ́noise level acceptable, 8-hr timer, etc. It should be used with windows open. I really love this cooler and would recommend it. I am waiting to see how long it will last and update my review.|Positive
Fit perfectly. Installation a breeze.|Positive
Fit well and the price was right. Time will tell how well it holds up.|Positive
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! IT KEEPS ME COOL ALL NIGHT!!!! GREAT PRICE TOO!!!|Positive
DO NOT BUY THIS! We bought two a few years ago and both quit working after the first few months. We took them back and got replacements which lasted the summer then both pooped out the following year. One pump went bad, the other had a leak at the drain plug. The pump was replaceable but the plastic plug was faulty and entire unit needed replaced. No thanks! Well, just today the unit with replaced pump quit working (yep, pump again). We purchased different unit from another manufacturer for the faulty plastic plug unit and that one didn't cool well....so, we are reading reviews to find the next candidate.....I mean candidateS!|Negative
just what I wanted for my AC|Positive
Do to my crazy Aunt in Law deciding she didn't have room for it in her apartment, and that she would rather complain that it was 120 in Phoenix, she returned it and I got my refund. I have zero doubt that not only would it have fit, but that it would have worked flawlessly; just like anything else I have purchased from Home Depot.|Positive
Arrived to house in a timely manner. Easy to hook up. Would give another star but it hasn't been operating very long. Seems to do well so far. Last pump was roughly 5 years old. Probably more. Now i'm wondering about changing fan motor. Never changed yet. Knock wood.|Positive
this cover is the best. After using the first one for 24 years, it wasnt a hard choice when i replaced my coolerto buy another cover. good old fashioned american quality.|Positive
bought this for a 850 sq ft apartment in Bend Or . It is working fine not any louder than a 24 inch box fan|Positive
Fits great easy to put on.|Positive
Just what we were looking for for our swamp cooler|Positive
Excellent product. Easy to use and works great.|Positive
Easy to assemble but only cools small area.|Negative
Perfect for my outdoor water feature to keep reservoir topped off due to evaporation.|Positive
Pulley Puller’s are Magical. You can bang on that pulley for hours and get nowhere. But slip the hooks of a pulley puller around it and screw the central screw into the pull shaft and it silently, magically pulls the pulley off the shaft. It’s an amazing tool that does what nothing else can.|Positive
My bedroom gets hot in the mornings so I bought this to help keep it cool. It works great better than expected.|Positive
Was already defective in box . Had to return. Poor assembly.|Negative
Bought this evaporative cooler in 1996 at Flagstaff AZ Home Depot. Still going strong with same fan motor. Just bought 3rd water pump (each lasted about 6 years, can't complain). Changed pads once or twice each summer season. Excellent cooler when humidity is low here in high mountain/desert (obviously--it's a swamp cooler). Can use as regular fan during high humidity days and nights. Happy to have it.|Positive
No problems worked great I installed by myself easy peasy|Positive
The original cooler motor lasted 22 years; I hope this replacement does as well. Check with me in 22 years. The change-out was very quick and simple. You must have a pulley puller to remove the pulley from the old motor. I was so glad that Home Depot had free shipping; motors are quite heavy. I also shopped Amazon but they did not carry this item.|Positive
This is an excellent cooler. With this hot summer in eastern Washington stats, we have consistently been 15 to 29 degrees inside the home then the temp. outside.|Positive
This unit is an upgrade for an older one. This one works so much better. It has a lot of power to send the water through the vents and allow the cooler to work as intended. This is a strong, and yet quiet pump. Highly recommend this one, especially since the price is very fair.|Positive
Poor quality plastic water float regulator|Negative
Luma Comfort Cooler love it well worst the money|Positive
Replaced a Master Cooler with this one - is working great and my house is cooler than ever. Price of pads are less, airflow is better, even sets better on the venting. Very happy.|Positive
Have to replace these motors every 2-3 years. We have highly mineralized water. Home Depot has a good supply of evaporative cooler parts and accessories. It's pretty easy to find what I need at Home Depot. I prefer HD over Lowes.|Positive
The unit was very easy to install. It runs very quietly. Great cooler I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a window unit.|Positive
The cover was as expected, it fit well, I was concerned about whether or not it would have enough extra material to go on easily. It did and fit fine.|Positive
They fit like a glove made by the company that made the cooler this customer is extremely happy got 6 years out of the last set expect the same as this is same quality yes I would recommend this|Positive
Moves a lot of air, and uses a lot of water. Lately it's been too humid here for it to really be effective, but we'll see when the air is drier.|Positive
This is a wonderful cover for my swamp cooler. It fit just perfect. Made of a real good material. Should last a long time.|Positive
Fit perfectly, but overpriced. Still, it's hard to find this type of grille, so that's the price you pay.|Positive
Works great. A little louder than my old one though.|Positive
Easy to unwrap, to install and test. Always get the pumps at Home Depots.|Positive
This machine cools our grow room with no problems. We are really happy with it's performance compared to a very expensive hvac system in other rooms.|Positive
As Advertised|Positive
"air flow -very good portable -nice water use - a lot (normal) use - garage and enclosed trailer arrived damaged from UPS (waiting to hear back from Home Depot) plastic case, louvers, tabs, control panel mounts break easy, ""Handle with care"" 1 week use, time will tell"|Positive
Delivery was on time and the pick up at the store was easy!|Positive
The opening doown the side should have velcro as opposed to laces|Negative
It is very nice to have this when I'm working in the garage! The moist air being blown out helps to keep it comfortable. It very quite running on the lower speed. The oscillation is nice too!|Positive
This makes the room comfortable. I am in Seattle, adding ice works best. It does not cool the room like an A/C, and not any louder than any other fan I have.|Positive
The pad was just what I needed|Positive
Rugged simplicity makes winterizing a snap!|Positive
Doesn't cool the air as much as we expected...even when humidity is low.|Negative
Works great, easy to install, abit of a challenge to get on the roof of the house|Positive
It was delivered very quickly and was ready to use only had to attach casters and add water. Three speeds are more than adequate for a small room. The only bad thing is the cellulose pads are not very easy to clean and kind of pricey top replace and not easily avavalible. The unit works very well as long as it's not humid. It is constructed very well. It's a very good deal for the price.|Positive
replacement for a broken pool filler. worked very well so far.|Positive
This cooler vent cover used to come with these coolers at no cost. Now they do not include them make you purchase them separately. what is next, no motor to keep costs down on the cooler?|Negative
Does the job.|Positive
"The fan on this air cooler works fine, but the air cooler does not work at all. I can't tell any difference from the fan to the cooler. No matter how cold the water is I use or the ""freezer"" pack it comes with, there is no difference in the air temperature."|Negative
Did not really cool thing down. You had to be right in front of it.|Negative
It was easy to install, works great !|Positive
I used this cooler to replace an older window unit I installed through a wall in my shop. The old unit was pretty worn out, so this one brought an immediate improvement. I was impressed with the quality, and when I called the manufacturer with a question, they were very responsive. So far, so good...|Positive
"Nice unit but doesn't ""cool"" very well. . . ."|Negative
The 5300 CFM 2 speed portable evaporative cooler was easy to put together and rolls around with ease. It is said to cook 1600 square feet so it should handle our 1200 square foot garage handily.|Positive
This was easy to install, and is doing the job it was made for, it is much lighter than the old one I had|Positive
Great work wonderful . I highly recommend this product|Positive
I had a small roll-around swamp cooler that helped, but not much- so I bought this one. What a difference! I have a 1,200 Square ft garage and it has been upwards of 105 here in Vegas- but this keeps the garage around 80-85 degrees.|Positive
Was right|Positive
Your basic direct drive evaporative cooler. Had it shipped to store to reduce chance of damage by home delivery. Build quality looks decent. One of the pump bracket screw was laying in the pan and I had to replace it and one of the wire clamps need repositioning as not to pinch the wire. The cooler was more of a cream color instead of white as pictured. The color was one factor of my decision to purchase but not a deal breaker. I looked at the same size Champion/Essick cooler. This one has easier to use toggle switches instead of a recessed knob that can be hard to grab. Also the side panels are easier to remove for servicing. This model looks to be made for many distributors as mine didn't come with a name on the face plate and is identical to the Dayton model sold by Graingers. I emailed Hessaire directly before cooler arrived to obtain an owners manual. Kim P. was very helpful with sourcing one. I am happy with the product and it is working great. 96 degree day and garage is only at 72 degrees. Great deal for price paid.|Positive
The Bonaire Durango 5000 CFM is the best decision we have made in a long time. The traditional metal systems we had took many hours of maintenance. Every few years we would have to take all the panels down to scrape, sand, coat and paint. The bottom pan had to be painted with the rust resistant coating every other year and it still developed corrosion in other places and eventually rust overtook the unit. The Durango is quieter than the metal ones and it cools the house to 70 or below on even the hottest days. Practically the entire unit inside and out is UV and hail resistant plastic polymer so we will have little to no maintenance except for the yearly shut down and start up work. As an added bonus the energy company is giving us a rebate because the unit is so efficient. We are very pleased with our unit and will never go back to the rust buckets.|Positive
Using it to cover our heat pump for our pool while not in use. Fits perfectly.|Positive
Its worth every penny. Performs better then any other cooler. Works great.|Positive
A good little personal cooler but pretty small for a garage in the Valley of the Sun Arizona in July.|Positive
Works great at cooling a room easy setup and operation. Easy to add ice to the system for a faster cool down. The only complaint I have is when moving all that air around it is a little loud.|Positive
I thought the pads would be a bit thicker, but still am pleased with my purchase. They fit my evaporator cooler perfectly. Should work very good when the weather gets hotter. I do not like the foam pads I had last year as I could not find the straw pads, those pads did not allow a good air flow as the straw pads do..|Positive
Just a little trimming and good to go easy to install|Positive
Your store employee connie and associate were fantastic|Positive
works great just a lot of extras to buy to get workubg like duct to insthal in window.|Positive
Easy to assemble (just put wheels on). Hose attachment did not work. Easy to fill directly with hose or spout can. Rather loud. Rolls easily on hard surface. Provides comfortable work area for the remodel and will be used in garage and hobby shed afterwards. China quality but seems to work fine.|Positive
Doesn't work properly.|Negative
First thing to note....this is not an air conditioner as most people think of it. If you run it in your house the temerature will not go down. That being said, if it is blowing toward you, you will feel cooler. It does not use a lot of power and don't have to fill it with water often. It would be nice if the ice compartment was a little bigger and insulated, because the ice does not last long in it. It may not be perfect, but it is a nice addtion to the deck on hot summer days.|Positive
water pump was instock and shipped quickly to our plant|Positive
Fit perfectly! And has already withstood some high winds without incident. An excellent value!!|Positive
It was easy to put on the cooler. The tie string doesn't hold the cover on in the wind. My suggestion is to put bungie cords on to hold it place so the wind doesn't take the cover off.|Positive
It never really worked for me. It never cooled down my room to what I expected. I understand that AC will definitely work better but it consumes more electricity. I tried using it according the owners manual and unfortunately, the heat never went down. I researched more info about swamp coolers and I even used in days where humidity in LA, CA was below 50% and it never really worked. I also put like 4 gallons of ice and then added water but it never kept my room cool. I decided to return it and got my money back. Maybe there was something wrong but the manual never really explain how the pump might not be working. Maybe that's what was wrong. I don't know. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this product. Thanks.|Negative
So far all is good|Positive
fit easily over my exterior AC unit for winter time protection. Have to wait and see as to how long it holds up in the elements.|Positive
Keeps our screened porch very comfortable in the hot heat of Phoenix. Very happy with the evaporative cooler!|Positive
We had a previous thin vinyl covering on our central A/C unit outside, which due to sun & weather crumbled after one year when I was removing it this past summer. I'm really not into buying a new cover every year. Saw this one, which had the right dimensions to cover our large A/C unit (which is 32x32x38) - so ordered it. It arrived & when I installed it, I was surprised by the heavy canvas (I assume it's built to last.), it fit well (has room for a few more inches each direction than our unit), and had a velcroed opening its entire height to allow a snuger fit around piping, and then a drawstring around the bottom to hold the cover on from wind. Perfect.|Positive
nice product not as noisy as some have said in past reviews. New pads are expensive.|Positive
Pump was easy to install and fit the unit. Works great.|Negative
Nice big fan. We hope to use rather than more expensive AC install and electric bill in hot dry climate this summer. Also like that it will help humidify the air. Grew up with with swamp coolers in So Cal and they worked great. High expectations for this one in 800 sq ft in central WA. Fan noise will be a lullaby if it keeps the place cool.|Positive
It serves its purpose, but did come with a very strong chemical smell - we aired it on the porch for about a week before using.|Negative
The unit was efficient and light weight|Positive
Cooler seems very well built, works great and looks good at the same time. No rusty old gray or brown cooler hanging out of your window. Accordion window fillers are junk, too tight to stretch out, wouldn't stick. I had some sheet metal fillers made - $15. Purge pump is worth it, saves water. Installation instructions are really bad. Big problem is how does the exterior cover come off? Just unscrew the 4 screws, two on top and two up from the bottom, slide the exterior cover up having somebody hold the main body. Have fun. Maddog|Positive
this pulley is working fine in my cooler|Positive
An effective and economical way to cool my office. Far cheaper 10x than a built in E-vap or split AC system. Only work is to fill the water, which is insignificant. And there is the fan, which you get used to. All in all it’s excellent.|Positive
It was exactly what we needed.|Positive
I'm so glad I purchased this swamp cooler. It attractive, quiet and blows cold air. I use it in my bedroom to sleep at night. It definitely helps keep me cool but it doesn't cool my whole room, just cools where it's directly blowing. I put lg ice pack in tank with a bunch of ice and some water and it keeps cold air blowing for hours. Going through this change of life and being hotter then I've ever been, this machine is a life saver!|Positive
Fit like a charm.|Positive
It doesn’t seem any cooler than a fan|Negative
"This unit is a bit bulky but is very effective to lower ambient temperatures in hot outdoor areas. It's easy to move around with the lockable casters and only weighs about 30 lbs. This cooler can also be used indoors to remove hot air making it cooler inside. Don't confuse this cooler with an air conditioning unit because it's not. I would suggest getting this evaporative cooler if you live in a climate that's hot and dry and are going to use it outdoors. I plan to bring this to my condo in Las Vegas where temps can frequently exceed 100 degree's making it hard to sit outside on the fairly large covered patio for a prolonged period of time. I tried it out at my home in Michigan on the deck before it got too humid and it performed as described! You can really feel the difference in outdoor air temperature within minutes. You can fill the cooler with 10.6 gallons of water or you can hook up a hose (hose connector included) for a continuous supply of water which is what I would suggest. I like that you can add ice to keep the water cold. (see pictures for more details). There are also louvers in front that can be adjusted up or down and independently of each other. If you live in climates where the humidity is high in the summer, this cooler will not really perform well. It is also stated in their information that it works best in the dryer, less humid parts of the country, like the southwest. I've used ""misters"" on my patio in the past but they had a tendency to get everything wet so this unit is a welcome change for cooling the area I plan to use it in."|Positive
The straps work perfectly, thank you !!|Positive
remove and store for winter, it will last longer.....|Positive
The cooler is great...The charge on my card for the cooler was $78 more than the customer service person told me it would be...Please if possible can someone contact me and get this resolved.|Positive
it works great|Positive
Just bought my second hessaire evaporative cooler to keep my chickens cool during our hot Arizona summer|Positive
This cover fits even better than the previous cover I had. The material is easier to work with than the old canvas cover. It gives a better wind proofing than that cover did. We will see how it weathers the winter - not tested by anything bad yet!|Positive
Bought this item for a family member they stated it workef well for first weekbut now only blows hot air|Negative
This product is advertised on the Home Depot website as indoor/outdoor. Upon installing it on our outdoor patio the directions are clear that it is for INDOOR use only. This was clearly false advertising by Home Depot. I'm super disappointed as I really liked this unit and now I have to figure out how to drain it and take it back to the store.|Negative
Good product was what I expected.|Positive
Exact fit, works great.|Positive
We bought this when our A/C went out in May in Arizona (dry climate, dry month). We placed ice cubes and water in the unit as instructed. With the cool setting on, it blew out the same temperature air as our $20 Walmart table fan. Do not waste your money or time experimenting with this...it will not work.|Negative
This is a sturdy replacement for my current cover. It arrived as scheduled and should outlast my Swamp cooler.|Positive
Excellent product that has helped keep my house warmer in the winter time.|Positive
Great product cools my garage nicely|Positive
Much lowder and larger than I exspected.|Negative
Exactly the same replacement part I needed looked everywhere|Positive
"My master cool swamp uses odd size pads.Width was short by 2"". Height was short by 2"". Made the difference up with 2"" foam board.Works great now."|Positive
"We have three of the Bonaire coolers. They want $90 for a replacement pump. Yeah right, no way! We put this in and it makes this cooler work a LOT better. Just use a spade 1"" bit to drill a hole thru the casing where there is not the outer pad assembly. Put the cord thru. Take the old round electric line that went to the old pump and put a wire nut on it - tape it up good. You are set to go at $38. Be sure and use some strapping to attach the pump to the back wall."|Positive
Not enough evaporative pad area to reduce the incoming air temperature. The fan impressed me! It can blow your hat off!|Negative
I returned the cooler for a refund because it was damaged on 6/20/17.|Negative
I kept delaying my purchase for my home shop, based on what I read on the internet about semi humid areas. ( We get 28 inches of rain a year). I finally bought one and it works great. When it's hot here, it's usually dry so humidity is lower and it works well. . Anyway, it lowered the temperature of the air coming out of it 16 degrees, so I just roll it over to where I'm working, and all is good. It's easy to fill, switches feel good, water level gauge is handy, and motor is quiet.|Positive
The MaxCool Rigid Media installed in my cooler with minimum effort and is now operational in my cooler and is now operational in my cooler.|Positive
It works great as a FAN but not so much as a cooler it puts out warm humid air|Negative
This unit is great.|Positive
Product was made of nice quality.|Positive
Installed easily. Quality appears to be even better than the last one I bought.|Positive
This product did the trick|Positive
The order that was sent included four panels, three of which were the correct size and one which was incorrect.|Negative
Returned the item due to some form of mildew.|Negative
Yes easy to use|Positive
It does the job i wanted it to do|Positive
Although these types of units do work well the effective cooling from this unit at 4900cfm would be 1225 square feet for every square ft you intend to cool you need 4xs'the cfm unless you have high roofs then you need a little more|Negative
The cooler works ok, it's a good size, but it is very noisy .|Negative
Just what I was looking for...|Positive
Following directions explicitly, when I took out water container to fill and check filter media, the two clear hoses were kinked. There was an open ended hose that looked like one of those hoses tied together should go into, and when I called store for assistance, after being made to feel like I was bothering him because he was busy, finally got him to open one up and look. He said he easily de-kinked the hose with his finger, and because mine would NOT de-kink, made it sound like I was at fault. There is a small third open ended up-facing hose that looked like one of those other ones should be inserted into, but nothing is mentioned either online or in instructions, there are no hoses even pictured. When I plugged it in, it leaked all over my carpet.|Negative
Works very well but water fill area is very narrow. I had to buy a bucket with a narrow sprout. Also does not include size of adaptor needed to use a hose so had to buy two different ones to try.|Positive
Excellent product.|Positive
I purchased and installed the this evaporative cooler back in January 2015 and installed it shortly thereafter so it would be ready for spring/summer. Wanted to wait to post a review until I had some time using it to see how it works and so far it has exceeded my expectations. This cooler replaced an old Kenmore version where the pads rotated on the sides through troughs of water. Because of that the pads on that cooler were always completely wet and I was always concerned a drip version would not work as well, but that cooler was on its last legs and I had to get a new one. Also, the replacement pads for that cooler were very expensive (~$150 annual expense) and you could only order them online from Sears. This cooler looked like the best one out there so I bought it. My house is a little over 1,700 sq ft. Installation was not that hard and it was a close fit where the old one was installed so I only had to do some minor drywall/stucco work after installing it. The only hiccup with this cooler is that the drip system did not evenly distribute the water across all the pads. Five out of the 6 drip lines worked, but I couldn’t get water out of the 6th one unless I plugged one of the other ones. To solve this I installed pieces of ¼ inch landscape tubing in the 5 that worked to restrict their flow a little and then was able to get water to come out of the 6th one to get all the pads being evenly wet. I also had to tape over a couple of the slots over the pads to direct water to where the pads were dry, but other than that the thing works great and it usually meets or exceeds the air temp output when compared to the number identified on the humidity/outside air chart matrix that you can find online. It’s also pretty quiet compared to the old Kenmore one that it replaced, plus when it comes time to replace the pads it won’t cost hardly anything compared to what I was paying before. Since I’m not using the bleed line I’ll probably have to replace the pads more often because of mineral buildup, but that’s ok with me. You can’t go wrong with this cooler.|Positive
work great fits perfect.|Positive
Fit perfect, works well. Only comment is I wished it had a flexible coupling so you can choose the direction the hose bib pointed|Positive
I had a similar cooler on my roof the was extremely rusted, so I purchased this one to replace it. Not only was it what I needed it was the exact size of the one I was replacing, making it easy to replace. Keeps the house cool, on the low setting my house stays at 68°, I haven't needed to use the high setting yet because this cooler is very efficient and quiet.|Positive
nice upgrade from my old one. seems very well made. Also Champion offers the ability to buy parts.|Positive
This does the job as described. Great to keep cool|Positive
I bought this for my daughter who has a 4000 sq ft home but the upstairs stays hot in the summer - this works wonderfully well for the entire upstairs where all the bedrooms are.|Positive
Works just like it's supposed to. Imagine that.|Positive
Easy to assemble and install|Positive
This is our third summer and it is still working perfectly. Takes little space but does the job effectively. Easier to manage than a larger window or roof unit.|Positive
It works pretty good in a small bedroom. Using the evaporator makes it alittle cooler but need to have it directly on you.|Positive
I replaced the pads on a Bonaire Durango window evaporative cooler and these pads for perfectly|Positive
Good quality pulley at good price compared to other dealers/competitors.|Positive
Very nice breeze but the water/cooling feature sounds like a pipe burst. Really noisy when the water is pumping. The fan is pretty loud even on low, so there is a trade off.... if you’re looking for serious air movement, yes. If you aren’t used to high decibal sleep depravation, no.|Negative
Overall the unit functions as advertised and worth the money. It was not assembled thoroughly and the drain plug was not tightened. Result was the first time I filled it from the front, it leaked out the back without my seeing it. Several gallons later I got it into a sink. The gaskets were there, but the jam nut was broken and would not seal to the body. I fixed it myself with some caulk on the threads. It cools well and consistently. Water gauge DIDN'T break yet like the other reviews. Best to fill, set the timer for 6 hours. Single digit outside humidity here, so evaporation works well but it seems to draw more power than advertised. I was going to run it on solar panels and a 1500 W inverter and it trips the breaker turning it on. Instructions are unclear, screws at the top to get the wheels and base out of the inside.|Positive
Low performance, had purchase another slightly larger unit prior that works far superior.|Negative
Working as expected|Positive
Drilled a hole, fit and tightened it up. It does just what it is supposed to do. Adds water to my hydroponics when it needs to.|Positive
I am taking it back today. This product generated heat thus defeeting the purpose of cooling the room down.|Negative
The unit is easy to install. All of the pieces and parts are included for installation. The air flow has only two settings. It would be nice to have continual air speed control.|Positive
Seal at spigot is terrible, tried Teflon tape and paste. Poor casting quality. Not recommended.|Negative
Performs as expected to do. Right product for the job!|Positive
Very Large! works great - remember to have some windows open if used inside.|Positive
I bought this when the summer started this year and it was super helpful when the kids would go out in the playard or when we had family over. It does a pretty good job kipping everyone cool.|Positive
Great experience! Delivered well.|Positive
very cheaply made it did not blow cold as was to do and leaked not good|Negative
I did quite a bit of online research looking for an evaporative cooler that I could move from room to room and that was in my price range. It was important to me to purchase one before the really hot temperatures arrived but as close to them as possible so that I could try it but be able to return it within the store's 90-day return period if it didn't work out. During my search, I learned the steps needed to determine what size cooler would be best for my small home. It was important to figure the CFM, so look that up. In my case, I didn't purchase a cooler that had a higher CFM rating and might have cooled more of the rooms I was going to use it in, in part, due to price. This one was on sale at the time, and it appeared to have most of the features I thought important to me. It doesn't really cool an entire room due to the size I selected, but it's great when directed where I am. That works for me! And, it's so easy to maneuver from place to place. One other point is that since it has 3 different speeds, the lower one is quiet enough when trying to sleep. That's, of course, an individual factor. Reviews by those who have purchased a product are always an important factor to me. At the time I was making a decision, this cooler received 4 1/2 stars.|Positive
The Luma Comfort Evaporative Cooler is small but mighty! It's quiet and efficient, and it can take care of a whole room for both temperature and humidity. We love how fresh the air feels, and enjoy the remote feature so that it can be controlled from across the room. Purchasing was easy, and shipping was very fast!|Positive
The cooler has worked great thank u so much|Positive
Very good product would recommend|Positive
Reviewed product online through HomeDepot.com. Purchased and had delivered to my local Home Depot. Installed with ease.|Positive
This pump moves the water keeps the pads wet for max cooling|Positive
Having the correct replacement pads has made a HUGE difference in the performance of my PMI cooler. I tried the blue stuff as replacement pads but was unable to cool my house to less than about 84 degrees or higher. With these new and thicker pads, my house is now 70-72 degrees. Perfect!|Positive
This low voltage evaporative cooler switch does everything I want it to to do. I like it's outdoor high voltage electrical box which puts all of the AC wiring at the cooler. The control is low voltage which means I don't have to spend a lot of money on Romex wire plus I can put the low voltage control at a better remote location in the home. The switch should be mounted at eye level because the illuminate display can only be read at eye level, tough to use when you have tall and short people. Maybe someday they will make a remote control control with no wires.|Positive
It is very noisy and does not have the ability to cool a normal room. I am very upset.|Negative
This is our second one we have purchased. The first one is in an out building for our pooltable rec room. Worked so well we got the second one for the workshop. Hot dry heat in California,( no humidity) so the swamp coolers ( evaporative coolers) work very well and use much less electricity. : )|Positive
I wasn't expecting such a cheap pump to perform. Just using it as the purge pump. Much cheaper than those with the built in electronic timers. It just so happens that my MasterCool has the plug for this. Quiet operation.|Positive
Cools ok if you are right next to it|Negative
Excellent product and not to heavy to install by myself. Also it cools a lot of my house|Positive
Installed in rental property. Tenant happy with product. Used to replace much older rooftop cooler.|Positive
Was excited to purchase this unit but it failed to meet expectations... this was basically a fan not an AC unit... does not blow any cold air even when I filled the tank with ice water. The people who left good reviews maybe already had ac in the room, this will not work in a hot room where's there's no a.c like a a garage.|Negative
This review is completely based on assumption. I have yet to start my evap cooler since it was installed last week because I had my roof replaced and I was replacing an old one. It was installed in January. I live in Colorado. I did not start it up yet. I look forward to the day that I do!|Positive
Water pumps are poor quality. Purchased two units and both water pumps failed within two weeks of use.|Negative
I haven't installed the motor yet but it promises to be a good fit.|Positive
4500 series Durango. perfect fit. It takes time to mount it right. I mounted mine little low(filter). Made sure no flies can enter. Water distribution is perfect. It smells for a few days. I recommend opening water leak off valve to maximum for one or two day's. Nice and cool. Fresh|Positive
I added these straps to help hold wrap and new cover in place. We get some pretty strong winds, and these really help. At this price I didn't expect much, but they a very well made. Really liked the METAL buckles. More than long enough to go around my large cooler.|Positive
Our son uses it in his room. He is very pleased with it. It is running well and keeps him at the right temperature.|Positive
"Was hesitant to purchase after reading several reviews. However, this cooler is all I expected it to be. It keeps my room comfortable. I have central air but this room is on the other side of a garage wall and, therefore, stays warmer than the rest of the home in the summer. This evaporative cooler is ideal for this area - it looks pretty nice too. I have found that using a few ice cubes and distilled refrigerated water rather than the ice packs that come with it, keeps it operating in ""cooler"" mode longer at low speed (about 7-8 hours) before it automatically switches to ""fan"" mode. Of the two programs, I prefer ""night"" mode which feels like it comes in ""waves"" and seems more quiet than the rest of the presets. The ""swing"" mode is great if I don't want the air blowing directly on me 100% of the time. It is as pictured and stands about 6"" taller than the top of my desk. The rollers are great so that it can be moved easily to get to the large water drawer in the rear of the unit. I have had this for about 3 weeks, use it every day, and am pleased. If it keeps going as it has been through this summer I will have gotten my money's worth and would not hesitate to purchase another one for maybe my garage or 3-season porch. It appears to cool a large size room without problem."|Positive
My ac cover was delivered to the store early, I picked it up and the bag was in good shape.i would order another one if I need one. Thanks to Home Depot I have a great cooler cover for my Ac.|Positive
Must Read! The unit works great and the fan is powerful. This is my first experience with the Hessaire Portable Evaporative Cooler and I was impressed not only of the unit but the square footage coverage is correct. The product was shipped to my home and was received in excellent condition and to my surprise nearly fully assembled. All you have to do is install the wheels on the bottom of the unit. Once out of the box and after reading the manual, you will need to purchase a couple inexpensive parts to keep this unit operating like new and problem free. Hessaire recommends keeping the water pressure from a hose at a safe level so I highly recommend you purchase a Camco Brass Water Pressure Regulator 40055 which does this without going through the hassle of trying to measure water pressure every time you plug in a hose. I also recommend you purchase a water filter to keep the system clean which I highly recommend a Camco TastePure KDF Water Filter 40043. Once you remove the filter from the package, flush the filter thoroughly until the water is clear and as instructed on the box. Both of these items are available through Home Depot online. In regards to using the unit, I would highly recommend that you prime the system by turning on the pump only for a few minutes and letting the water saturate the filters on all sides of the unit prior to turning on the fan. The unit works best this way. Read the manual for air flow ventilation so that the humidity does not get to high and definitely visit the Hessaire website. According to the Hessaire website, under the FAQ section of 20 Frequently Asked Questions, I was surprised to discover that you can add essential oils for aromatherapy or pest control to the water! This helps to eliminate the out of the box odor that is common on these units. Don't forget to dry out the filters at the end of the day by turning off the pump and running the fan for 30 minutes. Also register your unit with Hessaire on the Contact section of the bottom of the page of the website.|Positive
over all it is working great.....you had several boxes make for 67 in. but you only had one mix with other sizes...|Positive
Great price, average quality. Fans work great, pumps are adequate, definitely made for arid environments.|Negative
Very accessible packaging. The fabric is very durable also washable. This should last years with the appropriate care. Seems very instalated so my heating cost do go up in the winter. Very affordable.|Positive
placed over our swamp coolers by our competent plumber|Positive
Kicks A, 99 degrees outside and 70 inside, just love it!! Quiet and cheap to run.|Positive
Manual is poorly written, oversimplified, and does not address several important installation issues.|Positive
work like a charm It kicks and the power is much better than the smaller one Order went really easy would do a transaction again|Positive
this is a vary good piece of equipment vary pleased with it|Positive
What a great little potable cooler. I am using this portable 3 in 1 evaporative cooler in my greenhouse. Not only is it an air conditioner but it also humidifies the air so the plants do not dry out in high temps. The 3-speed fan is great for smaller tender plants. The 588 cfm evaporative air cooler works great in my 15 by 15 greenhouse and will solve many heat problems this summer.|Positive
Bought this 8 in pulley for a go kart drive mechanism. Arrived in a week and product was as expected. The few things that could have helped more was a description of the width of the belt that fits this pulley and the width of the key channel. The set screw is only something like 1/4 in long and I wanted/needed it to be longer. Luckily Home Depot also has set screws of different length for sale. All in all it is working out nicely so far.|Positive
leaked alllllll over|Negative
"I needed a 57"" but no one in Ogden or Salt Lake had 1 and was told the 56"" would work, it is very tight so I don't know how it's going to work? won't be using it till next spring?"|Negative
Had a hard time finding the right size for our ac unit. This covers it. I did buy some rope to help keep it tight. Working great so far.|Positive
For the price I paid for this unit, I got an EXCEPTIONAL deal!!! Fantastic cooling! Very happy ☺|Positive
I really liked this thermostat, I mounted the control box in the cooler and the thermostat 30’ away from the cooler. You can run heavy gauge wire to the cooler and 18 gauge wire to the thermostat.|Positive
Great that pump available other than the mfg. the only thing was the wiring did not match Where you plug in to the inside panel. On our unit it had a one connection that had two wire in one connection. Had to cut wires and match connection..|Positive
This portable evaporate cooler is really good and the style is nice. I’m glad I purchased this oneDoes a great job on cooling the room|Positive
Based on other reviews I decided to purchase this cooler and I'm glad I did. My house has vaulted ceilings in the living, dinning room and kitchen and these rooms stay hot when the other side of the house is cool. I purchased this unit to cool these 3 rooms so I wouldn't have to run my AC excessively. Now I run this baby and let my AC rest until night time when we go to bed. Based on other reviewers I installed a mesh screen around the pump to stop debris from entering it. Just got it a couple of weeks ago, so I can't speak to longevity. But it cools great and is much more quiet than my industrial size fan. I just roll it up next to my back sliding glass door. I run just the fan in the morning when it is cool and it brings in cool fresh air, then as the day heats up, I crank on the pump and voila! Nice cool air in the heat of the day. I'm hoping to save big time this summer on my electric bill too!|Positive
Heavy-duty fabric, excellent fit over turbine vents. Excellent price. I'm very pleased with purchase. Highly recommend.|Positive
Powerful fan with great features including the cool water tank. great for hot weather areas of the country.|Positive
I was able to make this work but the corners are not anywhere near the specified dimensions (it is more like 42x42 . So it will not last because the Seams do not reach the corners so I am sure the corners of the cooler will poke thru the single canvas layer in a very short time.. If the top seams were at the specified dimensions there would be multiple canvas layers at all corners... Just disappointed - I was happy to find what should have been a good fitting cover but it is not. Too bad because it seems to be well made other than being incorrect size.|Negative
My o my this is the best cooler ever my bill dropped from 185 for Central to 40 bucks a month my house is cold, lol all the way to the bank!|Positive
This 6500 cfm cooler was made for a bigger house so it works great in my smaller house when set to the slowest speed. So far it is costing me about 15 to 20 dollars a month to run, and I use it 18 hours a day. At 90 degrees or less this big cooler can make the house a little too cold. sometimes I have to turn it off, or switch to air only (no water) It came with all the parts for hook up, except for the water line and motor. It even had new pads installed. I would say it was a good buy that met my expectations. Donald Jetman.|Positive
MOTOR WAS THE WRONG SIZE. I RETURNED IT TO Home Depot WITH NO ISSUES.|Positive
After you set the temperature correctly, this works nicely to turn the cooler on as needed, especially when you're not home to turn a switch. However, the three degree lower programming to shut the cooler down is inefficient - I live in the high desert and it's plenty hot, but the cooler does not turn off until 2:00 AM with this feature (the house is a meat locker by then), so I shut it off manually at bedtime and turn it back on again in the morning, the residual heat inside the box it's mounted in does make a difference here too.This seems to pretty much defeat the purpose of having a thermostat to me . . . this has been both a pricey and disappointing purchase.|Negative
Fits perfect!|Positive
I have only used the fan two times. I am still waiting for a hot day to really see what it can do. So far, very good.|Positive
Overall I am very happy with the performance. The garage refrigerator has an easier time of it and I can work comfortably in the garage, plus the car is comfortable when we get in to leave.|Positive
Works great, cools my house very well.|Positive
The only thing to do when you are running an evaporative cooler. Should use at least 4 for 6000 cfm's.|Positive
Water tank supply is very good. Keeps the kitchen and family room cool.|Positive
"Hooked it up and it leaked through the screws that hold the back that has the media in it. Called the manufacturer and they said ""Can't you calk it? Because we don't have any of those in stock"""|Negative
took some adapting but works great|Positive
Much too loud to use in a bedroom and failed to cool the room down as well… very disappointed.|Negative
works very well in hot weather for RV.|Positive
Works Great. I had to order it over the internet. Was larger than I expected. I use it in my RV if needed to cool on really hot days. I keep it in a closet. I had to remove the bottom 2 draws, but it fits perfect. Lucky me. Currently we are in a extreme hot spell, so I am using it in the along with the AC in our home. Keeps the entire house cooler than it has ever been. We have to set it up in the large dinning room away from living / family room where we watch TV. Other wise it's to cold blowing near you. It's been 103-109 out side this last week. AC in the house is set at 70. It does not move. With the swap cooler the AC seems to run less and it's a very cold 70 with it running, Can't really rate it for durability or how long it will last, just got it. Easy to fill and drain, very easy to move from place to place. I read about several types and this one got really good rating. Swamp cooler last a long time usually. Only time will tell. I am very glad I bought this cooler.|Positive
Save your money and do not buy this.... after purchasing this last week and installing it this past weekend, i am not satisfied one bit at all. I replaced my old style, rusted out in every corner, down draft 3000DD unit with this model ADA51. The 3000DD was already there on my roof when i purchased my home three years ago. Big difference between these two units, don't be fooled by the looks of the ADA51 unit. My old style one, the 3000DD which uses the Aspen pads, kept my house so much cooler on low speed. This model does not compare at all to keeping my house cool... not one bit at all, on either speed. Only at night is it some-what noticeable. My 3000DD made my house at night like a freezer, and very cool in the day, much more cooler than the ADA51 unit, again, this unit DOES NOT compare to the 3000DD. I thought we had put the Media in wrong as we did take it out for installation, but we did put it back in correctly after all. I did some research and talked with owners of this unit in my neighborhood before purchasing it, they all approved of it. That's why i purchased it. Sorry, i don't approve of it. In short, my 3000DD was much better and a lot cooler. I'll never buy this style again. In fact, i am thinking about returning it to the store. Complete waste of money, a lot of hard earned money. Save yours. Now the positives with this unit: Has a replaceable plastic tray that the water sits in so the bottom of the unit will have a much more prolonged cabinet/floor life (wont rust out). If only the 3000DD had that (they should come with it, Essick). Installed semi easy with a friend of mine with a minimum amount of tools and some foil tape. A neighbor thought it was an a/c unit, lol. Looks great (works lousy tho). Strong sturdy cabinet that comes apart easy to install motor/access the media etc etc. Comes with the water circulation pump and scale screen installed already, Power cord, Bleed Off kit (but i used the optional Powerclean purge pump instead, sold seperately as shown in orange), Media (has 5 year warranty), Power plug-in base (which can be put on either side of the cooler), Belt, Drain outlet. But again, not a good working unit... sorry Essick/HD|Negative
OK, so I like this cooler float over the plastic inexpensive ones available here at Home Depot...but for the price I should expect at lease two seasons out of this product. However, the weak spot is the float adjustment screw it slips, strips or breaks down (granulates) in the water. I am responsible for 3 coolers here in the Arizona SW and every year I am changing out at lease two of these. I recommend this only because I can't find a stainless one that lasts. Stay cool my friends!|Negative
I bought this cooler to be eligible for a utility rebate and added it to an enclosed porch. It will requires additional items to install it, most obviously an electric motor and some sort of through wall duct connection, plus weatherproof electrical. And due to its weight when filled with water you need to put some thought into how it’s supported. It’s not a casual initial installation. But if it’s replacing an existing evaporative cooler it should go faster.|Positive
Works just fine.|Positive
I very much enjoy this cooling unit. It was a very nice surprise from my employers. I work in a building where the A.C. is not generated. It gets sweltering HOT. I used this unit and WOW! It's incredible and I am purchasing myself one for the home. I LOVE the add the water for reduced cooling. It's also fairly quiet. I am at my desk and have calls all throughout my shift and noise is not a factor and the unit is right next to me. I am happy that Home Depot has this unit and I am making my purchase immediately. I wish I would have known about this years ago. It would have saved me from the number of heat waves we have had in L.A. and not affording the price of A.C. bill for running the A.C. in the home.|Positive
Mine arrived a bit beat-up. I suggest opening the cooler side panels before powering it up.The pump had broke loose and was wrapped around the fan blades. Needed to be untangled and be re-secured. There was also a hole in the cooler base from the broken pump attachment. This allowed water to leak and create a mess. Once repaired, it runs great and easy to operate. Three speed fan pushes a lot of cool air. Easy to move around and the garden hose feature is great. Can't beat the price. It cools my 1800 s.f. workshop/game room very well. I'd definitely recommend to my friends.|Positive
These straps are plenty long and the secure my cover real securely! You can easily trim off the unwanted ends and use a lighter to melt the ends to prevent fraying.|Positive
Highly recommend it. Very easy to use. Provides cool air. Worth the money.|Positive
Very disappointed in this product. We spent over $400 on this unit and the motor went out after two months of usage. I'm very upset about this and will be contacting the company that makes it and Home Depot. Don't waste your money on it.|Negative
Very loud. For as little air it pushes out, which is expected because of its size, it's very noisy.|Negative
I purchased this cooler in April 2016 and since then I have repaired it & replaced more parts on it than I ever had with the old one that had been on my roof for 18 years. I have never been so disappointed with a purchase in all my life. At this moment, I'm now looking on Craigslist for a used replacement as it is 100 degrees today and another day without the use of my cooler.|Negative
Great cooler.|Positive
I do not recommend it. My $20 fan works as well . It does not seem to cool very much or work as advertised.|Negative
Have only used it twice -- getting used to it (for garage) -- seems to be a good help in hot CA. weather.|Positive
We got this to supplement a bedroom that gets the worst heat of the day...and so far it has been great! Temps have been in the high 70ies and eighties and if it keeps up as it gets hotter we will be super glad! The unit has lots of settings for speed direction and cooling...and we found that adding ice to the reservoir was a winner when it was hotter. It's is about the same height as my floor fans...but it is big. I thought at first it would take over the room but I put it out of the way near the cracked window (required for proper airflow) and I don't notice it unless I get cold. It is quiet and the water tank is pretty easy to fill. A couple of gallons is lasting the whole day. Over all pretty satisfied!|Positive
As far as I know the snake is the easiest way to clean out the spider legs when flow of water decreases.|Positive
We bought this to cool our converted (and insulated) garage in Southern California. It cooled some but I think it must work better in even drier areas because it didn’t do enough to cool things down. We took it back and will end up going with an AC unit instead in the future.|Negative
It works well in our dry Colorado heat. It cools down the kitchen and hallway. Drawbacks, small area to fill the water and it uses a LOT of water.|Positive
It fell apart within the week|Negative
I'm sure it's the cooler, not the pump, but when it gets hot outside, miss 90's +, its hot inside too. This unit does not keep up. My older, different brand, unit kept us cold unless it was humid outside. This one doesn't.|Negative
The cover was shipped immediately. I installed it well before the first snow because of the occasional heavy wind we receive. I added straps to control movement of the cover. I look forward to years of service from the cover as it protects my newly installed air conditioner can/compressor.|Positive
the slats come off quite easy to allow more air flow|Negative
Easy to install and works good|Positive
This is the fourth summer we've had this one installed. It says it will cool 800 sq ft (mine actually said 700 on the box). We use it to cool a living room which is about 240 sq ft. It just about keeps that room cool when the unit is on High. Installation and use are typical. No problems there. Unit is fairly loud as others have mentioned. I have never had to service the internal parts, other than a good cleaning at the end of each season, and replace the pads. No problems there. Overall, I gave it two stars for the value category, and three stars overall, because I think this unit should probably cost about $100 less than the price shown on the site. It's not nearly as powerful in cooling as it claims. If they had only claimed it could cool 300 sq ft., I might have given it four stars.|Negative
Fits perfect and looks great. An excellent value.|Positive
I ordered the 12 in. rigid filter for my MasterCool evaporative cooler. I looked everywhere at stores and online. Home Depot had the best price due to free shipping. I got the item in just a a few days.|Positive
Heavy duty cover - we had another just like it for years. Didn't really need to replace it other than it was filthy and looked ratty.|Positive
I bought the Durango 7000 since my house had the 1/2HP Ultra Cool. Ultra Cool was a rust bucket. I did down size the motor to 1/3HP because this unit is way more efficient on air flow than the old squirrel cage model. Installation was easy and the design fantastic I think. Time will tell if holds out for the long hall.Noise is only an issue if you buy too large of motor like I did at first. I talked to Bonaire and they explained how the fan moves more air because a squirrel cage fan only pulls from 2 sides and is heavy with belts and pullies.|Positive
$1 per day to operate vs $10 with air conditioner....my family lives in the Central Valley of California....humidity is non existence (rain is also pretty much non existent as we'll... the last few years anyway....unit runs best w/low humidity). Anyhow this unit is a beast, got it from Home Depot at a few days ago....2 hours later this baby was pumping cold air throughout our 1640 sq home....first night temp got down to 59 degrees, had to run on low speed (can run 3 speed fan w/without water pump) the rest of the night...I am looking forward to the savings per month...should have done this years ago...but it is never to late....The remote is a nice feature as we'll! Bonaire you rock!!|Positive
So thin didn't hold enough water to cool. Have had to go buy new ones elsewhere or wouldn't make it thru the summer|Negative
The weatherguard evaporative cooler cover was everything I expected. Will know more how it performs under inclement weather conditions as time elapses.|Positive
If you are looking for a little extra humidity and cooler air then this will work great for a small to medium room. My dogs absolutely love it when they come indoors when it's over 100 degrees outside. It helps to cut down on my electric bill. Great product and great value.|Positive
This is a wonderful cooler cover - easy to install and the vents are adjustable to allow air to flow in multiple directions.|Positive
FOR THE PRICE IT WORKS WELL AND IS EFFICIENTLY MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN AN EXPENSIVE OSCILATTING FAN|Positive
We used this float valve for our water fountain. It keeps it at the water level as desired. Thumbs up!|Positive
Just as ordered.|Positive
Seems a bit larger than all our other covers some of which we bought at HD. Just has to be tied tighter. Works well.|Positive
Excellent, well built product|Positive
This not cooling good|Negative
We live in central Arizona where its HOT with very little humidity in the early part of summer. This little unit was a godsend when the bug a.c unit stopped and it took several days in the hottest part of the summer for it to be fixed. We slept with it running with a hose attached, loved the sound of the water,makes one think of a fountain. It really did the trick, kept it in front of an open window with cross ventilation . It does not work well when its humid in our monsoon season, so its been cleaned and put away for next summer! !!|Positive
Works well, pretty quiet. Easy to fill with water. Nice looking.|Positive
We have been using the aspen cooler pads for many years. We have tried other kinds of pads, but none have produced the fresh, clean air that we need. The first time you use them you may smell an odor that smells like hay, but that is for a very short time until they are “settled in”. They are less expensive but higher in quality than the “sponge type” pads. Lasts the whole summer. Keeping out unwanted outdoor odors. We love them. Wouldn’t use any other kind. Hard to find, but order online and pick up at your local Home Depot.|Positive
One didn't work at all, just made a funny noise so we returned it. The one we kept will keep you cool sitting right in front of it, but not much use for a room.|Negative
worked as expected|Positive
I love this product. It cools my daughter room nicely. The only problem is the way you have to let the water out of the tank... But would recommend this with thumbs up.|Positive
This product is exactly as advertised, BUT it doesn't come with the pins and washers, also called keepers. Can't find them and without them it will Not stay in the right location. I would advise your customers of that. The pins are only good for a one time application so I think you can see my problem with this product.|Negative
Works great for cooling. Only downside is the cardboard filters give off a very strong fish like odor.|Negative
Would rate it higher, but the cooler was missing the belt - which was suppose to be included. Had to buy a belt which included several more trips to the store because Home Depot didn't have the correct size in stock.|Positive
Got one a year ago and like it so well I bought a second one for the whole house.|Positive
This product is a cross between a fan and an air conditioner. I live in South Carolina and have no central ac. I use this when I watch TV and sit directly in front of it. It feels like you're catching a cool summer breeze. I plan on buying a larger capacity unit for next summer.|Positive
This is a replacement unit. I previously owned one for over 15 years before needing to replace (bottom rusting out). Works great to cool my lower half of the house. Again, it will depend on the humidity but on hot dry days it is wonderful. I use it out past Riverside, CA|Positive
Cooler works great! We replaced a window air conditioner that just was not keeping up with the 90 degree days. Only problem was when I first started running the cooler was the water pump wouldn't work. Which I found the bottom of the pump needed pressed together.|Positive
This product is working great for me, sometime something like this is hard to find. Thanks caring product like this for evaporative cooler's|Positive
Was good except no holddpwn.|Positive
I've really enjoyed this cooler. It works very well. We had it installed and I recommend that. A lot of my neighbors have this unit and it was recommended when we needed to replace our old rusted out swamp.|Positive
Bought to use outdoors and works good. We use ice water to make flow cooler|Positive
Product changed since previous version. Old version had a larger on/off window. It would run and cool a couple degrees below set temperature. New version comes on and goes off at the set temp, which frequently short cycles the motor (especially when the inside temp is pretty stable).|Negative
This is not much more than a very pricey fan. Does not cool very well, maybe a couple of degrees cooler than ambient temperature. Would not purchase again.|Negative
Good unit , came with all the attachments , absolutely loved it !|Positive
I put this in my evaporative cooler as instructed, and immediately, my room became 7 degree's warmer. It made a huge difference. It is well worth making this purchase, it pays for itself and then some in the money you save in heating costs.|Positive
"We live in Montana, and our dry climate is perfect for this evaporative cooler! With this hot summer and an older home, this unit has been a game-changer! Used in our living room, we love you can (in fact, need to for proper operation!) leave the windows and screen door open and let this portable unit offer amazing relief from afternoon heat. It offers a pleasant, cool air quality--different from the ""chilling"" of an air conditioner--perfect for keeping the room a comfortable, breezy temperature. Our living room has never been a ""haven"" in the summer, but it is now! (Our 200 pound English Mastiff likes to situate himself right in front of it!) In addition, the unit couldn't be more simple to operate, right out of the box. Yes, it has fan noise, but, to us, that's a small trade off for its performance. (Just turn up the television volume a bit. :) ) Big thumbs up! We couldn't be more pleased with this purchase!"|Positive
Easy to put on. Heavy duty quality fabric. I bought a cover slightly larger than needed. Worked well. I also used bungee cords to secure.|Positive
I* put in and it as working great. It didn't match the slots from the old one but I took some wire and wired it in place so no problem. It works a lot better than the original one did so I am very happy with it.|Positive
It puts out a lot of cool air. The timer function is great, so it doesn't have to run all the time. It helps keep our A/C bills down.|Positive
I am very happy with my cooler.|Positive
The Evaporative cooler works great.|Positive
The device operates and empties the cooler tray. You still have to clean the pan out as often as before, so I would say it's effectiveness is marginal, at best.|Negative
Didn't cool down the room.|Negative
Energy efficient, strong fan and output. The legs worked well and the installers/installation was good but not great. There is a seal incomplete that the roofers will have to seal when the new roof is installed in the beg of October. All around---HD service/personnel, at every level, was exceptional and the installation was good. The unit itself works perfect for our home's design and 1750 sq ft main floor which receives the bulk of the cooling air.|Positive
super|Positive
Blew out hot air from the back so it cancelled the cold air it blew out from the front|Negative
Work perfectly -- matched capacity perfectly--installed in minutes|Positive
Worked great. The only problem we had 5 nuts had wrong theards pitch.|Positive
Pump was easy to instal|Positive
Product is good and am happy with how it performs but am not happy with the water tank, It is too small. About 1 gallon. It only lasts about 4-5 hours. It will not last through the night and if you us it at night it will make noise and wake you up when it starts to run out of water. And this is at slow speed. They should have put a larger water tank on it.|Negative
Works perfectly!|Positive
Fit perfect and arrived quickly! Easy to install!!!|Positive
The only thing that this will be able to cool down, is a Barbie playhouse. Don't waste your time unless you 2' by 2' Box|Negative
works perfect, check your size though.|Positive
Very cheaply made...will not stand up to the water flow without getting clogged. Don't waste your money. Purchase a hard plastic basket.|Negative
The remote control is very handy. The fan distributes the air flow very evenly through out the house.|Positive
I read all the reviews before buying this cooler. We wanted it to blow better than our last cooler so we went up a size. Our home is 1420 sq. ft. and this unit is for 1800 sq ft. Just like the review ours came in with a dent on one side. But when I called Home Depot they were very good about giving me 10 % off. The roofer assured me they could bump it out without any problems and they did. They are coming tomorrow to re-roof the house and install the new cooler and air conditioner. So when we start it in a month or two I'm sure we will be very pleased.|Positive
Bought it for a home office that's just under 200 sf ft. Set up is pretty easy to figure out. Filled the tank with water and instead of ice added a frozen cold pack I use for insulated coolers (got the idea from a reviewer for a similar product who used a frozen plastic beverage bottle filled with water) and so far it has done a nice job of cooling the space. Giving it 3 stars because its pretty noisy but I can use the remote to turn it off when I have phone calls.|Negative
Fits perfectly great quality!!|Positive
Fit as described- easy installation- as good as the original!|Positive
easy to assemble. Made it easy to adjust the water pressure.It was perfect for the job.|Positive
Although the intensity of menopause makes any tower fan effective, this is more powerful and has more options than my previous tower fan. I made a video so you can hear the sound of the 3 fan options. #1 Natural turns off and on as the blades swing. You can hear the natural sound of the birds chirping to put it in perspective in the short video. Sleep is only slightly less noisy than fan. I will probably never use it because the fan is stronger and cooler. A swamp or evaporative cooler does not work effectively in hot, humid climates. On the up side it uses less electric than an air conditioner. A plethora of information online tells me I calculate the square foot of a room and divide it by 2 to find the CFM I need. 320 cfm, covers a small room. I could use a slightly larger one. The evaporative cooler comes with a freezer pack. It goes in the freezer, then in the water cooler on the tower. The ice pack in the water does help cool. There are several good articles by consumer reports on evaporative coolers across the internet. They are worth reading. Also, I researched NewAir coolers at the government recall center, no problems so far. I find maintenance high. it has to be cleaned every couple of months to prevent mold and mildew on the cloth that is used to recycle the air. Evaporative coolers don't recycle the same air over and over again, like an air conditioner. That's nice in a home where you want to keep windows open. Read the information on how it will work in your climate before you buy and calculate the CFM you need, then look at your budget. This is actually working better in a small room than the specs say it should! One summer I sat with a bowl of ice and a fan, big improvement from homemade cooling.|Positive
cover is very easy to installed very easy to put on and off|Positive
I needed something to replace a heat pump that went south. I mounted the unit in an un used bedroom. Took me a couple of hours to build a stand for it and set some cement blocks for it to rest on. Got 4 young strong guys to set it up on the stand and the rest is, well, a no brainer. Hooked it up to a water supply plugged it in and adjusted the float. Yester day it was 95 outside and it running at low speed. It had no problem keeping the house at 73 degrees. It is not loud at low speed and since its in a un unsed bedroom it wouldn't have mattered if it were. I am very happy with this unit. It works great and am now sealing the window space around it. Well worth the price. Love it...|Positive
Works great in our dance studio. If it's humid you can't use the pump!|Positive
I am very happy with this cover. It fit perfectly and looks great. Super easy to install. Only took a few minutes. It has cut back the amount of cold air coming in from the outside quit a bit. I recommend this|Positive
Direct replacement no issues|Positive
The machine is working well but we did not get the wheels.|Positive
You cannot control temp and has no thermostat so ya either leave it run all day or when ya get home wait for 2 hours while it cools your house down. Also called customer service to speak with an engineer, very bad cr said engineer would call still waiting.|Negative
Good fit in the cooler case and good cooling. Did not give 5 star due to the media being very delicate and easily damaged during handling. Definitely more cost effective than the original for areas with very hard water that causes the media to scale over mid season requiring it to be changed.|Positive
This Fan has been great when I don't want to run my air. It comes with 2 ice packs to make the water cool wich really does make it cooler..|Positive
The first one I bought didn’t work so I had to go back and exchange for another one. :-(|Negative
This is a good well built product that performs as advertised. Delivery was faster than expected. I had it delivered to my local store and picked it up there. It puts out a lot of air. The motor and fan are reasonably quiet, but wind noise can be loud on high speed. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is that the documentation needs work. For example, I needed to remove the front grill to get the duct through the window. The documentation shows that it is removable, but doesn't tell how to do it (it is held on by clips, not screws). Only one type of window installation is shown and requires that the unit be placed down on the lower sill. In my case that would have been about 2 feet off the floor and was not acceptable. Suggest YouTube for installation ideas. Once installed, very satisfactory.|Positive
the motor mounts where not screwed together,I found a hand full of screws laying in the bottom of cooler. when I went to put on the house legs the screws for them had been cross threaded and the heads on the screws had been striped I could bearly get nuts off of them. I think they need soom qualty control or new help that takes pride in there job|Negative
Goof product. Runs straight on my bandsaw... Used to slow it down...|Positive
It's a great product. Easy to install and strait forward to use. My only gripe is, there isn't enough thread space for it to align well.|Negative
Good replacement for older cooler Easy to install Great value|Positive
works ok|Positive
I was able to take it out of the box & snap it onto the front of the cooler.|Positive
A great addition to my shop.|Positive
I purchased this fan thinking it would help cool down my room. It didn't cool the room worked just like a regular fan for only 2 weeks. It's kind of loud in the med or high setting, need to have the T.V loud or the fan on low. Other then that it was a waste of my $100 for 2 weeks worth. Wouldn't recommend it at all.|Negative
The package was smaller than I thought it should be, but it was vaccumed pack, so it was true to size. Very durable and sturdy cover that should last many, many years!|Positive
The top seam was switched to close to the edge. This caused seam to open up and basically made the cover worthless. Will not buy any of their products again.|Negative
Works very well my outside dogs love it they are the primary benefactor ...when we first got it we let it run in the house ...not a great Idea . The pads that hold the water get super smelly like wet cardboard smell times a hundred but that will slowly go away after week or so of use....|Positive
It blew out cool air but it does not cool down a small bedroom. I returned it.|Negative
Couldn't find a cover to fit my swamp cooler, but bought a larger one and used a couple of straps to keep it tight and keep the extra tucked in. Bought it a Lowes, but maybe buying direct I could get one that fits better.|Positive
It works like a large fan. No cold air really comes from this.|Negative
We had our granddaughter birthday and it was 102 outside and this thing didn't do anything for us you had to be at least 5 feet close to it, so the party ended inside the tiny house, not happy will be returning this item.|Negative
It is broken fan died and I am trying to return it now|Negative
This is NOT an air conditioner. It even reiterates that right on the box. My window swamp cooler died in the middle of the hottest part of summer and I can’t replace it till winter or so. For the interim, this is a good way to beat the heat. I live in an arid climate. If you don’t, I wouldn’t recommend this. The product says it’s for a 300 sq ft space. Mine is 600 (the other half of the house is garden level and stays super cool). If I point it at where I’m working and have a fan on, it’s actually fine. The instructions say to open a window. With my window unit I kept one open about an inch. I tried that when I first got it and my house was a literal swamp in about 15 minutes. I opened it all the way and it’s all good. Again, if you’re looking for an air conditioner don’t purchase this. If you prefer the lake breeze effect, this is perfect. The reservoir is huge and I only have to fill it after about 20 hours running on high. I don’t add ice because it has to melt before the unit can use the water anyway, but it does have the tray for it. All said, I am very happy with the cooler. Does what’s expected in the right conditions.|Positive
very easy to switch out the old for new. works perfectly|Positive
it was exactly as advertised. no more, no less. works fine, no surprises.|Positive
Bought this unit online through Home Depot at the end of May. Pump did not work even though indicator said pump was on. Called manufacturer they sent a new pump. My husband installed new pump and it did not work. Called manufacturer again and they sent another pump. Again my husband installed 2nd new pump and again pump does not work. Called manufacturer for the 3rd time asked them to send a new unit and we were told that would not do that. We are on our way to Home Depot for a refund of the unit and will not be purchasing this brand ever again.|Negative
"Like others, I was a bit frustrated by the sticking float indicator. Not a deal breaker since you can always look through the filling door, but today I decided to see if I could fix it. First step is to remove the back panel, as if you were going to clean or replace the media, or clean the reservoir. Sounds simple--remove two top screws, bend back the top of the panel while pushing the bottom of the panel where it's marked ""Push."" Well, it worked, but the amount of force and the loud pop when it finally released was pretty scary. Maybe because I've never removed it before and mineral deposits from the hard Denver water kind of ""cemented"" it in place. Anyway, once open I removed the one screw that holds the float assembly and then greased the pivot point of the float arm, as well as the slot that the pin on the arm fits into on the blue indicator. May sound confusing, but pretty obvious when you see it. It now seems to operate much more smoothly, though time will tell how long that lasts. With that I'm a happy camper with this cooler. Be realistic and keep in mind it's only intended to cool 350 SF; my son is very happy with it in his 20 x 15 room."|Positive
The first thing you will notice about this product is the overwhelming chemical stench that emanates from it as soon as you unwrap the plastic. I opened the item outdoors and was still overwhelmed to the point where I has a severe headache for the remainder of the day. I can only liken it to inhaling paint fumes in an enclosed space. I would say that the weight of the canvas is middle of the road in terms of similar items. I cannot say how durable it is as I have just purchased it but I can tell you that the strong chemical scent has no dissipated despite being opened for several weeks now. Also, for those concerned with aesthetics, it is an unappealing bright mustard yellow color. It's very ugly and stands out quite a bit. The only reason I did not return it is that I have an unusual size unit and it is difficult to find covers, otherwise I would not buy this product.|Negative
The cooler cover was a perfect fit.|Positive
I use indoors in an upstairs bedroom that attracts heat. Works great, but have to keep ice in it or it will fall off.|Positive
Is everything it was reported to be. Although we have it on an open porch we stay quite comfortable. Only issue we have found is that you must keep water tank at least half full for best cooling effect.|Positive
Same fit and size with no adjustments necessary|Positive
Great cooler for the money.|Positive
Cools great but it smells like an electrical fire stunk up our whole warehouse. Called the manufacturer they said it was probably the filter!?? They think. Well we ran it for about 5 days and no improvement, guess I have to haul it back to Home Depot and return it.|Negative
Worked when the thermostat for the cooler wouldn't|Positive
2nd filters ive ever bought and didnt fit,whereas home depot clearly states filters are for the Durango cooler. Mentioned 1 year ago in home depot that aftermarket pads are not fitting and are too short but seemslike nobody investigated comment|Negative
Worked and installed as promised. Very easy to handle. Has all the parts you need. Just need the motor as advertised.|Positive
I spend a great deal of time in my sunroom which has no heating or cooling vents. The NewAir cools the space quickly and quietly. I give it my highest recommendation.|Positive
Really satisfied with this product. Worked out great|Positive
Works awesome we love it. Works great keep it cold.|Positive
"I had no high expectations for this, considering it's ""cooling"" a 2-1/2 car Arizona garage. With low humidity (2 percent) and the garage facing north, I have the ideal situation. The purpose was simply to get it out of the 80s. It drops the temp a few degrees and adds some humidity, making my workshop tolerable. I thought the remote control was superfluous, but it is handy to turn on the unit from the house and come back a few hours later to a cooler garage. Only gripe is that it need a larger water reservoir, but it is easy to remove and fill."|Positive
Received pump with base broken off. I gorilla glued it together to make it usable.|Negative
I live in Calif and use this in my garage so I can do my projects without melting This unit is made very well ,easy to use and clean True it does not bring down temp 15-20 degrees that is only possible with real a/c I would recommend this unit for any one who want relief with out full blown ac I tried outdoors by my bbq picnic area did not expect much to help ,and it didnt but i am very pleased for garage /shop use|Positive
Us on the covered deck works great keeping us cool|Positive
Smell once water was turned on was really bad and never improved. Item was returned and we went with a different product. Home Depot ordering, return process and staff were all excellent.|Negative
Using this unit to cool my extra deep 3 car garage in Mesa, AZ. I use one bay of my garage for my woodworking shop. when it was 100 degrees outside just before noon, I was cold standing a few feet away from the front. It cooled the garage down to 80 and with the air stream directed at you, it's chilly. I had a $600 portacool for a couple of weeks and took it back. just not in the same class as this. If you need to cool a good size space, this is well worth the money. A user note: only open the flow control valve just far enough to get the pad wet... if you have lots of water running off the pad, you're actually removing cold and putting it into the reservoir, not the air.|Positive
Hard to find replacement filters and water level indicator is hard to see.|Negative
Works good. Moves a lot of air for a regular type fan blade. water pump could pump a little faster but it does an OK job. Yes, I would recommend to friends....|Positive
Cooler is perfect for room I needed to cool. If you need to cool a larger area than specified I would definitely buy a larger unit.|Positive
Instead of cooling a room, the motor on this product heated up our small bedroom. It could be an issue with my individual product and not the series, but we did not get what we were expecting.|Negative
Essentially it's merely a fan that doesn't cool enough to feel the difference between the evaporative cooler and an oscillating fan. Not recommended if you're trying to keep a room cool.|Negative
This universal valve works well in our front yard pond. It was easy to install and to connect a water line.|Positive
My whole house is around 500 sq ft. It does not cool this whole house. I'm putting water in this unit every 2 hours. I don't think I'd buy another unit like this. To spend close to $200.00 on this unit is too much. But then everyone charges to much for their products.|Negative
works really great thank you|Positive
"I am very pleased with the snug fitting cover for my small evaporative cooler. I only wish there was an available cover made to fit the 14"" x 22"" open face of the side discharge. However I simply covered it by stretching heavy plastic and secured it with sealing tape."|Positive
Good product for small room. Fit my need. Runs cool for about 3-4 hours before having to refreeze ice pack.|Positive
Good|Positive
Assembly was easy. Unit is not loud enough to be a concern. Rolls around easily. Fan blows nice volume. Temperature in my shop was ~96 deg., heat index was high that day <humid!>, about 101/115. Fan dropped air blowing temp by about 7 degrees. (the water out of tap to fill basin was WARM also). A few days later temperature was at 94 and humidity was somewhat lower than previous days and fan was able to drop air blowing temp from 94 to 83. Located in south central Texas.|Positive
It does the job and does cool off the room very well|Positive
Great fit, strong build and material, and well worth the investment.|Positive
I live in Northern CA in a 2000 sq ft house and this cooler works great. I have had this one three years, and the one I sold with my last house for 5 years. I can leave it on low for 98% of the time. I may kick it to high when it's 100 plus out for a few hours during the day. The part of the house it cools is about 1200 sq ft. The rest of my house in upstairs and it does not need to cool it. I did manage to hook up a thermostat to it but I am a licensed electrician. It was not easy with keeping the remote working. I took one star off because the motor contacts the wet cooling pad causing the open motor to get wet. I have had this my other Champion cooler and had to replace the motor long before its time. I will add a sheet metal shield one of these days. Or adjust the blower to pull the motor away. If you have animals counting on this cooler understand if the power drops out for a second the cooler will not restart when the power comes back on. You would need to hit the start button because of the way their relay system latches on, it starts with a momentary button not a mechanical switch. A problem if you are at work. I set my AC on also up much higher to make sure they will not overheat if the power cycles. If you buy a cooler with manual switches and no remote it may come back on during a power cycle. If they still make them. And with that model you can get a plug and play thermostat. My August electric bill went from $200 with AC to $90 when I started using this cooler. And I keep my house cooler than when I used AC. Put it in the shade. And put it in a place that aims down a long area like a great room or hallway.|Positive
Well made product, fits my evaporation cooler perfect. Haven't used it yet so we'll see how it holds up to our Santa Ana winds in the southern desert of California.|Positive
Amazing|Positive
"It's a pulley. It's round. It is for a 0.5"" shaft. It has a set screw. It SHOULD have been included with the sale of the swamp cooler motor. 'Nuff said."|Negative
Easy to use, light weight, and a good price. Served its purpose.|Negative
The cooler works like a champ. Only problem is that the control panel does not have a backlight or if it does our installer did not know how to hook it up. Keeps us cool in lower humidity and just perfect here in Arizona. It helps to keep our A/C costs down.|Positive
This thing kicks butt. I have it in 400 sq ft shop and it cools great. Uses about 2 gph of water which tells me it is working great. A little loud though. No big deal for me.|Positive
Overall it is a very nice unit. It works much better than my old one. It was a tight fit but I was able to get it over the existing duct work. It is slightly louder than my old one. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It could be I didn't get something tight enough.|Positive
Arrived all dented and scratched. Home Depot wouldn't discount. Very upset.|Negative
It fit perfectly.|Positive
The cover has a vertical seam with Velcro in one of the corners. This makes it much easier to install than many other covers.|Positive
Perfect fit. Good material.|Positive
Admittedly, it's only been installed a day, but wow did it make a difference in my parents' 1,400 sf house in just minutes. Mounted it in the window at the end of the hall and it blows all the way down and into the living room. Open the front door a crack on the other side of the house and you feel a nice gentle cool breeze. Runs very quietly too. The old unit was also a Champion and it lasted around 20 years. I wasn't comfortable with the thin chains and mounting hardware so had a platform built instead. Float assembly didn't look too durable but it works.|Positive
It fits perfectly...we will see how it holds up over time.|Positive
Great idea. Cheap made, needs a couple of ribs on the lid. Needs a couple of tabs that flip out and then tighten down to the ceiling. Like on troffter lights...|Negative
The only thing wife didn't like is the color, lol|Positive
Worked great to slow down my whole house fan. Seems well made and working well so far after about a month of use.|Positive
Unit operates very well. But, who ever came up with the method of attaching the side panels with the new configuration should be fired. The older units were fool proof. Slide it up, put the bottom against the unit and slide it down into position. Simple! Now you put in adjustment screws and latches and it's completely screwed up. Screws don't line up, can't get panel to fit properly, complete mess. Other than the bottom housing getting bent trying to get all the screws and latches adjusted to put the side panels to fit, and the side panels fitting incorrectly, it's great!|Negative
So far so good but its early in the season, lets see how long it last, I need to last till September.|Positive
Standard 3/4 hp electric cooler motor. Seems well built and runs smoothly. Puts out the wind ===|Positive
Maybe too humid in SoCal. Tank was full, fan blowing, but temp only dropped 1 degree.|Negative
I have had this cooler for one month now, and have used it on the hottest days, and the in-between. This product BARELY shoots our cold air, even when using an ice packet in the water. It wouldn't even cool a small 10'x11' room. I followed all instructions to a T (also live in CO, so perfect climate for an evaporative cooler). It's basically a $150 fan on wheels...my $70 tower fan works much better. I'm very disappointed. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!|Negative
Works Awesome!!! Purchased another after we got the first one. We used these at a birthday party, kept everyone cool on a hot day.|Positive
easy to install, but it comes without a motor so you can pick your voltage, there was some small damage on top where they stacked something, but they made it right for me, also a couple small screws were missing on the elect box, easy to fix.|Negative
We had the cooler installed soon after it arrived. There were no problems with the installation and the unit has functioned ideally since that time. There was a minor problem with Champion quality control in that the drive pulley on the motor was not tightened sufficiently at the factory and came loose, requiring tightening by us.|Positive
Product is as described. There is no wind entering our home. It was easy to cover the evaporative cooler using the straps that were also included in the purchase..|Positive
The unit was ready for installation also was easy to handle and everything was ok no missing parts|Positive
Yes, it did cool the room, but not by more than 5 or 10 degrees. The coolest part was in front of the unit|Negative
easy to install,|Positive
This item is well made adjustmentwas easyandfitperfectly I had a much smaller pullythat was fixed and I had to replace my motor after ten years so that pully was rusted onthe shaft and this new one was adjusted to a bigger diameter forfaster speeding my fan works great and directions are precise and complete with diretios for troubleshooting the reset switch if your cooler is over loaded I would buy this again for sure|Positive
Works very well. It is dry here (Idaho) so this way outperforms an air conditioner for the money|Positive
This plastic float is very poorly made with cheap materials that do not last more than a year. I have to replace these every year because of the poor quality metal and plastic that it is made with. It is very frustrating to buy such poorly manufactured products.|Negative
"AF-310 does NOT have ""ION"" function/option on the unit as advertised. If you look on the unit or the remote control, the ""ION"" function/button was eliminated on current AF-310 models. The literature and images on the website showed that it was included. If you don't mind that the manufacturer changed it without updating the literature, than it looks to be a nice looking unit. I have not tried it because I returned the unit. The ION would help to purify the air if it worked."|Negative
This is a wonderfully powerful portable cooler with a large capacity, powerful fan, and several speed and directional options. It's size does allow us to move it when we need and its tall thin shape means that it can fit easily in most rooms. It is the best room evaporative cooler I have ever owned and we love it. In terms of the plastic parts that surround it, there were some problems. For example the water level indicator periodically gets stuck. This has resulted in overfilling and spillage. Also, the plastic covers on the back are very difficult to remove. It took two people for us to be able to get them off and now we can't quite get them on correctly. I wish the plastic casings were of the same high quality as the inner workings, but the small inconveniences are well worth it for it cooling power.|Positive
This is such a fantastic product and I love how helpful it's been! I live in California and it gets hot! This evaporative air cooler and tower fan has been amazing for this hot California summer! My daughter is less than a year old and when she sleeps, she's basically her own heater. Thankfully this tower fan keeps us both cool during nap times at the height of the temperature every day. And since this state is so expensive, I love that I'm saving money by not having to run my home air conditioner. There's tons of useful features! The wheels keep it portable and easy to move from room to room. The oscillating feature keeps the whole room cool. The water tank holds more than enough water and on days when it's especially hot, I throw some ice cubes in there as well! Talk about a cold burst of wind. The remote makes it easy to turn on and off when I've got a very tired napping baby on me. And one of the most important things for me is that my daughter can stick her fingers through the grates and I don't have to worry about her hurting herself like I would with any other fan. I'd happily recommend this product to anyone!|Positive
I ran a similar model for about 10 years here in Arizona. We don't live in the hottest part of Arizona, but it gets up to 100-102 deg F. during the summer. We are able to cool a 2000 sq. ft. house with this model. I have been pleased with the cooler. I did though, have to replace the control unit once.|Positive
I live in the Arizona Desert. Compared to refrigeration cooling, the electricity saved between Mid April to Mid October with the Evaporative cooler will pay for the unit in one year, as it uses less than one fifth the number of watts per hour. However, it is noisy (VERY noisy). At 60 plus decibels, you will suffer hearing loss if you remain within 10 feet of it for very long. It will blow air up to 36 feet, so you can point it down a hallway from a distance to lessen the noise tremendously. A ceiling fan in the next room will further distribute the air, so you can hear the TV. At 91 degrees F and 27% humidity outside, it will reliably chill the air to 78 degrees F at up to 40-50% humidity inside, an unexpected plus for my house plants. Position it where you don't have to hear it, and it will be fine. Dump the water, refill, run 15 minutes and dump again once every week to avoid salt clogging the filter pads from the evaporated water!. I choose to manually fill the water tank about every 5 hours run time, but it can be hooked to a hose as it has a shut off float valve installed as it comes from the factory (Salt accumulation is more critical the way I run it!).|Positive
Great on hot dry day, but had rivulets of water running down the wall on humid days. Moved it into the garage where it keeps the space nice and cool when I work on projects. Somewhat worrier about the high humidity warping wood project lumber.|Positive
Very reliable product at a great price. I won't shop anywhere else.|Positive
As a blind person I found this item was an easy installation and has stopped the cold draft from the outside and the heat loss. I would recommend this item to others. John from New Mexico|Positive
I needed some of the items in the bag to get it going correctly and all pieces fit and it helped the a/c unit work worked great.|Positive
The cooler was very easy to install. It is made better and has an extra lining for the water to sit in, so hopfully the bottom won't fall out like the last on did. The tumbler or bird cage seems more stout and sturdy. Less noise and the housing is easy on the eyes.|Positive
I live in Clarkston, Washington which is typically the hottest city in Washington State during the summertime as this city is located deep in a gorge created by the Columbian Basin. This summer has seen a record of triple digits and I needed to find a cooler that could help cool off my bedroom as I sleep by day and work by night. I've only had this cooler for a few days and so far I am able to sleep like a baby!! I would recommend this cooler to anyone wanting to cool down a room to a comfortable level! Thank you NewAir for helping me to sleep during these hot summer months!!!|Positive
I bought two of these for my company's basement office where the air conditioning is broken. They work very well, bringing the temperature down about 15 degrees. We also like the moist air the units produce. I was worried about that given that we are located in NYC, where the humidity is often high in summer. But they've been great, and they are much more energy efficient than AC. The smell mentioned by other reviews went away after a couple of hours - not a big deal. I definitely recommend these.|Positive
Easy to install and took less than two hours from start to finish, works great the house is now very comfortable.|Positive
I ordered this for my bedroom because in the summer, it is the warmest room in the house. The portable cooler has made such a difference. I am really enjoying having a cool bedroom.|Positive
Easy to install---clear instructions. Great support from manufacturer on questions.|Positive
It did a great job at cooling the room down but you have to take it apart to clean the inside and there are no smooth surfaces to clean. It was very difficult to keep the inside clean and the blades clean. Even changing the filter didn't help the smell. I wouldn't buy this again.|Negative
The cooler pads were the proper size and hardware to attach was included. The new pads significantly improved the cooling ability. The old pads lasted 5 years.|Positive
Product was as represented. Sized right. Has an oil or wax substance on it to preserve the canvas. Should hold up well....only time will tell.|Positive
"Living in Las Vegas, we are not strangers to evaporative coolers and find them preferable to reconditioned air. Generally, they work great and, when maintenance is required, prove to be simple and accessible. NOT SO with this Champion/Essick Air model. Problem number 1: the back louvered panel offers the only access to the inside. After removing the single screw at the top (marked), we fought to get the panel off. It eventually yielded to the use of a putty trowel. The problem, as we discovered, was the incredibly poor construction of the parts. Problem number 2: during the set-up, we discovered that the float valve stem had to be inserted through the media in the side - and that the side panels are not removable without literally taking the box apart. Problem number 3: having managed to complete the set-up and fill the box with water, we plugged in the cooler. The pump operated well, but when the fan was started, a major issue was exposed. This is a design flaw, exacerbated by shoddy construction: instead of a single squirrel cage, this model has two, attached to either side of the motor and supported by brackets. One cage was properly seated - the other was listing to a degree that it knocked against the fan housing when it turned. This discovery led to problem number 4 . . . In order to access the motor/cage/bracket assembly, the ENTIRE box has to be disassembled. Why? Because: the screws that hold the fan housing are behind the front panel tunnel assembly . . . and the mounting brackets for the housing are screwed into the side panels, which have to be removed in order to disengage the bracket from the lip of the panel after it is unscrewed . . . but first you have to remove the top of the box so you can remove the side panels. After performing this vivisection on the machine, we discovered that the welded housing that holds the motor/cage brackets was crooked - which meant there was no way to adjust the listing cage. It didn't matter at that point, though, as we realized that the ""yearly oiling"" of the motor would require this same disassembly - that even replacing the pads would be a nightmare. Champion makes some good products - but this is NOT one of them."|Negative
Ordered 12 in. media on web & recieved 8 in. --Had to take to store for refund- Your Add is not correct-It states 12 in. & it is 8 in.|Positive
Low quality unit. Leaked water and even on outdoor and with a lot of fresh air blowing, it never really cool down even a small area|Negative
we had a porta-cool before at our big shops needed something smaller and quieter, found this unit figure I would give it a shot especially the price. Seemed real reasonable, been using it for a couple weeks it is great and its quiet I really like the oscillating feature. would definitely order more.|Positive
A little thinner than what I expected. Would not buy this item again but it works.|Negative
As expected|Positive
Came well packed, put together and ready to go. All I had to do was Fili it up with water and freeze the ice packets. Cooled my hot garage off enough to work comfortably. My wife is taking it to her I'll sister to cool her bedroom during the Brainhead fires here in Utah. Should do the trick. Very pleased with this cooler.|Positive
Cools the house very well! I have had it for only 2 weeks and it already is squeaking when it gets turned off and getting worse by the day. Probably bearings. Should last longer than 2 weeks!|Negative
worked just as it should, smell went away in two days and no problems|Positive
EXCELLENT Our bedroom has always been hotter than rest of house being on West side and next to garage. This unit has been a life saver! The water tank lasts all night!! Highly recommend!|Positive
The pads arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Each pad fit correctly and all the little fasteners were included. The smell of wet pads dissipated the first day. No problems here at all.|Positive
Was installed by professional and works well. No issues with the motor.|Positive
Bought a low end pump. Works well and does the job.|Positive
Works perfect|Positive
"Good unit, installed easily, works well. I use it in my garage which is not insulated, so it gets it ""less hot"" but doesn't really cool, not the cooler's fault, it does pretty well for it's small size."|Positive
Use it on my patio ( no walls ) when the temperature was 100+ and cools like a Boss! Friends and family were amazed!|Positive
5 Stars. This is perfect for a small space. It really cools. Different than a fan which just circulates hot air.|Positive
Easy to assemble but does not cool the area very effectively.|Negative
I got this to use in a small bedroom that I use as an office. It doesn't cool at all. It's comparable to a box fan.|Negative
Bought this Durango cooler pads a month ago to replace the old one.. It fits perfectly and installation hardware also included in the box.. So happy with my purchase..|Positive
I've had this for over a month now. It works fine at reducing temps in the garage until it gets over a hundred degrees, after that it just blows hot air. The check valve to shut off the water is temper-mental so make sure you buy a 25 psi water regulator or it will over flow. Water trends to dribble out the back, so I just used a piece of plastic to steer it back to its source. Overall a decent product for the price I guess.|Negative
Had to change it out four times.|Negative
It works so far|Positive
Very nice unit extremely cold Best shipping on a big item I ever received No dents perfect shape delivered to my drive way|Positive
The product does not produce cool air at all as promised.|Negative
It was too noisy and did not cool down the room at all. Putting ice cubes in it helped with the cool air, but the ice cubes would melt within 5 minutes. It also made the room very humid.|Negative
It worked great for about 20 mins before the fan stopped working. The unit has great ratings and I'm waiting for a new one to arrive Going to give it a second chance so look forward to my next rating for results|Negative
Product works good.|Positive
this really made our summer enjoyable, cool at night meant great sleep and during the day even with people over and in and out the house stayed very cool.|Positive
This does not circulate air at all. You're better off with a fan and an open door opposite to it.|Negative
Exact fit.|Positive
great price and you get four pads I don't know why but someone in sales for most companies only sell in packs of 3 when there are 4 needed|Positive
Just what we needed. Small and powerful! It works great!|Positive
What a wonderful change from the old evaporated coolers. This Frigidaire evaporative cooler has many different selections to make even the most picky happy. I love the silent and nature settings. Another great feature is the huge water tank. It means you don't need to fill it nearly as often, and when it does get low, the machine let's you know. There's even an air dry function so that you can make sure everything is dry before storage. The entire machine weighs less than 40 lbs empty so even with my bad back and shoulders, I was able to handle it myself. I would recommend this to anyone living in a dry climate.|Positive
the one we ordered was badly damaged so when they noticed they did not have the same one we were upgraded to the big one for the same price, it works great.|Positive
The pump should work fine in my evap cooler but it struggles would have bought a bigger one if I knew that|Negative
It fits and works great!|Positive
10+ thanks cools great. Pumps water to pads and we are a cool.|Positive
I purchased this product from another home improvement store. The product is easy enough to use. It took me a little research online to figure out how to add water to the coolers. It did not come with much of an instruction manual. The coolers do work great!|Positive
The product is good, I have this Bonaire system for 10 years.|Positive
Good Pads if they fit your cooler. I have 4 large commercial units which these are specifically made for. I got three years out of my last set. I've decided now to change every other year.|Positive
It works great|Positive
Is a great medium size machine, cooling very well for the space.|Positive
The pads appears to be a little thinner than the ones purchased at the store level when in stock.|Negative
It fit perfect. The fifth star can't be given till I see how long the pads last. OEM went years, last set not so much. This set I am hoping will last a few years. Great Price Super fast delivery.|Positive
They are as promised and are easy to install. There are very effective at cooling the air even in triple digit desert heat. I highly recommend.|Positive
Keeps our house cool.in this summer heat|Positive
It's really nice lamp and humidifier but for cooling the spaces it's not good|Negative
The pump works like it should.|Positive
Had to replace my old cover due to wear, this cover is great. Fits great, good construction.|Positive
These pumps work well for the price.|Positive
Very impressed with this evap cooler. It has made sitting on porch and my garage work manageable in the middle of July in south Louisiana. I highly recommend you buy this if you’re in the market.|Positive
Have an upstairs bedroom and a craft room that gets full south sun in afternoon. When filled with refrigerated water and the ice pack both rooms cooled down to a very comfortable temp. Has an excellent fan that can be either set on a stationary or sweeping setting. It is very easy to set up and use. Have already recommended to a friend for her son's bedroom.|Positive
Was not complicated; was quick to install! Don't know why I did not do it sooner.|Positive
We have to keep adding ice for it to stay cool. Of course I am not getting up in the middle of the night looking for ice|Negative
Purchased on-line at Home Depot as a replacement for a 30 year old Frigiking 5000 CFM cooler that just won't die! The order process was easy, fast and secure with Pay-Pal payment. Cooler arrived at local Home Depot store a week early In my opinion Frigiking coolers are the best money can buy.|Positive
easy to install but after 1 week of use it still smells and does not seem to be letting up.|Negative
Works great here in Arizona, (Keeps my home cool as long as humidity is low outside.) Fits perfect in my doorway of garage to hallway of home. No issues. Made of sturdy plastic so only 4 stars. This should pay for itself the first year with electrical cost savings. Water bill does increase, but nothing substantial compared to electricity. I would not keep this outside. I hooked up hose from outside under garage door so no need to keep adding water. I have had this now for 2 months and am satisfied so far. We actually get chilly running it at night. SEE PHOT0'S|Positive
The unit came on time and was what we expected. We use it in a bedroom as it is on the southwest corner of the house and gets warm in there late day. We turn it on about an hour before bed and it cools the room down a few degrees.|Positive
Clearly states 8 in stock and the location of the product! The employees and manger say they can't find it to just come back! This happens way to often. All these employees walking around but no one actually ever wants to assist you, or they just claim it's up in the bay and who knows when they can get to it. Horrible service! 60% of the time we end up going to Lowes. They are always helpful!|Negative
Stunk when fired up, I contacted the manufacture & they said this could last for a few weeks, they suggested adding essential oil or fabric softener. That is helping! Other than the smell when running pre additive, it cools well & makes a whooshing sound that is not to loud.|Positive
This cooler works so well that my house was cold when I came home after work when I left the cooler on the low setting. It has been so comfortable and I am really happy with my purchase.|Positive
This cooler is awesome in areas where humidity remains low. (Southern California) I rated it slightly lower on quality and value only due to its lightweight construction which may be looked at much more positively by younger individuals. This cooler produces very cool pleasant air and can move large quantities of air. This unit does require a full time pressurized water connection, and already has an internal float valve to control the water supply. I really like the energy efficiency and performance of this unit, but as an older person I miss the durability of enameled steel appliance construction of days gone by.|Positive
Easy to install,but I found a connection (purga pump plug), The owner`s manual don`t said where it go. After starting, the device started to throw water through the purge tube, for more of 2 hours, the leak coming from purge pump hose. And i was calling service department, i leave a mesages every day, on the sixth day, they auswered me..|Negative
This was purchased for a very small one bedroom apartment. It is no better than using a feather to cool off with. The feather would have been cheaper and most likely more efficient.|Negative
Not much on essays, product was easy to find, reasonably priced & it works as it is designed to do. Home Depot is easy shopping.|Positive
Does not cool as well as another brands cooler. Side by side this cooler has a 5 to 10 degree higher temperature output. I am in the southwest and have used evaporation. coolers for years. This one is a disappointment. Also the pads have a strong odor that has not dissipated with over 10 days us|Negative
Easy to install fits great and keeps the cold draft out during the winter months|Positive
Compact and very efficient. Worked so well I purchased another and plan to purchase a few more as gifts for friends.|Positive
Works great but it is too noisy and it disrupts my sleep.|Positive
Hard to keep them tied. Had to pick them up off the ground and go back up onto the roof a few times. A little bit to big.|Positive
Keeps home pleasant and our home is 2200 sq ft. Bottom of house is 75 degrees and upstairs is 78 degrees. Soon will install a thermostant on the unit|Positive
I owned a Champion evap cooler and used it for 30 years! Every summer, all summer. It was still working great but was looking really poor and was rusting significantly. So I recently replaced it with another Champion cooler. With the arid, dusty, pollen filled air and mega-drought here in the central Sierra foothills in California, this sweetheart works GREAT! So much quieter than my old one and the re-engineered squirrel cage fan pulls and blows so much more air than my old one that I was able to step down from a 5300cfm to this 4300cfm and be cooler and use less power than before!! Plus, this cooler adds some humidity to the house in this desert like heat and filters out most if not all the dust. Super product! Highly recommended!|Positive
Easy to put on and good material|Positive
good pads and best of all never had to leave my house to get them.|Positive
Fits fine , It is a belt what can I say .|Positive
Nice float|Positive
Exact fit for the failed OEM unit made installation a snap. Works fine.|Positive
This cooler replaced an earlier one of their units. The temperature outside is 95 and my 1400 square foot house is very comfortable. At times when it not so hot my wife actually turned it off and turned the furnace up because she was cold. WELL worth the money.|Positive
Basically a loud fan. There is no difference between the cooling feature and the fan mode even when loaded with ice and cold water set on high. At one point it began to spurt water when set on cool mode. Will be returning the unit soon. Do not waste your money.|Negative
Way too much humidity was released causing the doors and windows in my home to swell. But no worries, the fan broke after two weeks of use. Also the fan is loud.|Negative
worked great|Positive
I purchased one of these based on reviews being better than the larger Portacool. It worked great but wasnt quite large enough to cool our huge shop. I suggested buying a few more and the hubby insisted on purchasing the large Portacool. Well we did and this ONE Hessaire 5300cfm WAY out performed the other. So we took the large one back and purchased two more of these Hessaires. Now we have 3 and they keep our shop very cool. We can also direct the air better having multiples. A bonus was that the 3 of these were still cheaper than the one Portacool.|Positive
Love it. Keeps us so cool all through out the house. Didn't think we would use the remote...but we do...all the time!|Positive
Slow noice, great fresh air. Excelent for patios.|Positive
The air volume is great. The air coming out is usually about 10 degrees cooler than the outside air. Humidity here in Alabama is pretty high, I knew it wouldn't be as efficient as in dry air. It uses the tank of water about ever 6 to 7 hours on high fan. All in all it does a good job. I use it in my 1200 sq ft workshop.|Positive
good construction it was easy to put on the cooler|Positive
Belt is working fine|Positive
The controller lasted 2 weeks then failed|Negative
This was to replace a 12 year old cover which was starting to lose the waterproofing surface (yellow dust everywhere). 'New' one much, much worse. Covered everything with excess of this very poorly applied protectant. Cover is mottled where product appears to have been packed while still damp - result a cover I estimate will last 1-2 seasons, a big clean-up job on the cooler in Spring when I take this useless cover off, and a need to find a decent quality cover for next season. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless, like me, you left it so late in the season there was no real choice.|Negative
No cooling at all!!|Negative
This is an amazing evaporative cooler! It puts out more air than a bigger unit I was using prior! Also, the air gets much cooler do to the thicker and better media panels, over the old style thin cheap pads. Best money I've spent in a while! I'm very happy with the unit!|Positive
Easy to install. Instructions are easy to understand.|Positive
Fast and easy to install. Accurate within 1 degree temperature range after a few adjustments. Maintains set temperature.|Positive
The cooler itself when working works pretty good, cools my room with no problems. Now when it comes to working that is another story. Bought my cooler in May, didn't come with all the parts to begin with. Now 2 days ago(Mid July) the cooler altogether stops working. Not sure how a product just gives up after 2 months. Waiting on my replacement unit with fingers crossed.|Negative
easy to use and works well. looks good and efficient.........|Positive
Pads fit and work great.|Positive
This unit was purchased for a 12 x 16 workshop in Southern Arizona. An evap. cooler works best in a dry climate and when humidity rises an evap. cooler is less efficient. It's an import and is mostly made of plastic but it works as expected.|Positive
During the hot days that we are presently having in the bay area (California), I have used AF 310 to cool down the living room area, and it has done a great job, thinking about getting another one for the bedroom. Very happy with this product.|Positive
Cover material is of good quality. Better than expected for the price. Be careful when removing the cover from the package as it has a yellow powder that can stain cloths.|Positive
Works like it should.|Positive
So far they are fine. We'll see how they hold up after this winter.|Negative
Easy to work with and install|Positive
I use these anodes to zinc plate lantern parts. It is not the intended use for these anodes, but they work great in my zinc plating tank.|Positive
Does a good job of cooling. Water level gage is useless. Pump runs dry when level shows 1/2 full. I keep a hose connected at all times to eliminate the problem. Otherwise this is the best cooler for the money. I use it in the garage, patio and for a 12x12 shed making it very versatile.|Positive
Perfect fit. Heavy duty. Should last a long time|Positive
The covers were and worked exactly the way I needed for them to be. A good product for a good price and fast delivery.|Positive
haven't checked for leaks from the rain yet but seems to work. However, wish you carried a 23X23X23 cover as that is the actual size of my 2 ton A/C unit. But so far so good|Negative
It's been a pretty hot summer here and with my wimpy heat pump only a portable A/C unit would really keep me cool, but this product did keep my house a little cooler, especially when the ice packs given were rotated often and the unit was going in a relatively small room. I've gotten to using it in the mid-morning/early afternoon, as it keeps the room cooler longer during that time after opening all the windows and letting in cool air in the morning.|Negative
Fabric etc was great but l have to return it for a bigger size. I have to wait until I get out of the hospital and my daughter will return it for me. I will reorder a larger size from home. I was very pleased with the product!!!|Positive
Exact replacement for my ultra cool 5012 , fits perfect|Positive
My old pads lasted 3 seasons and I paid almost $100 from another vendor. I was elated to find them at HD online for a third less and with fast free shipping to my home. I am all set for next summer.|Positive
The cover fit well and is of good quality. Our last cover lasted 19 years. We’ll see how this one goes.|Positive
I set my central air to 78 and just run the swamp day and night on low. Most of the time my central air does not even have to kick in. If it is unusually humid out, then I'll set my Ac lower. Always remember to keep windows cracked for the air to flow through. I live in Las Vegas and my summer power bills are always under $80/mo and usually more like $60 and I live in a 2300 square foot two-story house. All night and morning my Bonaire cools the house and hat cool air Carries over to the afternoon. In the evenings my Ac may kick in for a couple of hours.|Positive
Great product. Cools a small room very well. Very easy to set it up and get started. Good quality. Just wish I would have gotten the bigger one now!|Positive
its just what I wanted and it came before delivery date.|Positive
looked all over for a small room evaporative cooler this fit my needs just fine|Positive
Bought a new air unit last September used it a handful of times and it stopped working. Contacted customer service and the representative Mark helped determine what the issue was and is sending out a new computer module to fix the broken one. Thanks for the help mark!|Positive
"The modern day version of a ""swamp cooler"". The item performs exactly as it says, it cools the air. It uses plenty of water (and ice for extra cooling) but it has cooled down our house during these periods of extreme heat that we are now getting. It is portable, the power cord could be a little longer but other than that we have had no problems with it. If you don't have A/C and want to stay reasonably cool this product is worth getting."|Positive
Great price|Positive
Works as advertised. Has larger water pipe fitting.|Positive
Shipping was quick. Delivery driver was pleasant and helpful where we needed it set for install. Product was easy to install and super easy to operate. Just what we needed at the price we could fit into our budget.|Positive
I just purchased my evaporative cooler about a month ago, unboxed it and started using it immediately. The unit has not moved from the spot I placed it when I took it out of the box and so far all I've had to do is refill with water and turn the unit on and off. It is now leaking all of the water out while in use and can't seem to figure out where exactly it is leaking and why it would be already leaking a month or so into use.. pretty disappointed.|Negative
"The pads looked way too small, but when I got them home, I could see they would fit just fine, and they did. They work great. We love the ""woodsy"" scent of the new pads. The old ones had gotten musty, so we didn't want to use them any longer."|Positive
Not a review - We had to return it because there was a big dent. Not usable. Then we couldn't get another because they were on back order. It was what we wanted, but we needed it without a dent.|Negative
Though this cover was intended for an evaporative cooler, it works GREAT for my outside air conditioner also! Heavy weight canvas, water resistant, and comes with draw string ties. I LOVE It!|Positive
Doesn't get real cool but the fan blows great!|Negative
Perfect for the chicken Hilton|Positive
The CA Gardelle (yellow) fabric is better than canvas. If the side strings are not suitable, they also manufacture a cover with hook and loop tape or rip-n-grip strip (velcro) for a tighter closure. That item is pricier and available by another blue competitor. I will use a strap at the base to secure that investment from flying away.|Negative
So we ordered this in May and have been using it for 4 months now. It cools down our house about 1,000 sqft. Which is nice if its 100 outside its 75 in the house but the smell is horrible. It has not gone away it went from a musty lake smell to a fishy smell to a full out sour milk smell. We spray febreeze on the filters which helps for a while but yeah the smell is terrible. For about three weeks in June it made a high pitch electrical noise constantly if the pump was on that went away though just as randonly. It does cool the house down and its convenient rather than pay 5 grand to fox the centeal ac so i give it 4 stars. If smells bother you though Id give it 2.|Positive
The dimensions were as listed. An exact fit.|Positive
Yes, I will if needed do business with your company again. I was more than pleased with the way my purchase was handled. A very great customer service Representative, Tracy is her name, handled my problem quicker than I ever expected. I had to return my purchase because of the plug leaking.. Within a week the problem was solved and the new one was here. Probably before mine got back to you. I was more than pleased. So nice to work with a company that truly puts their customers first. Gratefully yours Violet Davidson|Positive
"I purchased this slightly larger, bottom-discharge, instead of a side-discharge. I was able to cover the entire evaporative cooler, including the ductwork. The top is protected from snow and ice sliding off the roof, with a piece of 1/2"" plywood and a 2x4. Bungee cords and tie-downs, as well as the bottom draw string are used to keep the cover secure."|Positive
I ordered this for our bedroom in concord california that has been constantly reaching temperatures above 95° and i was excited to open the package only to find it was missing the plug to stop the drain hole. Soon after speaking to a helpful home depot customer care agent, i was informed that i would have to wait another 5-8 business days to recieve my drain stopper. Terribly inconvienient and disappointing. I will be using amazon for my order next time instead.|Negative
Easy Install and quickly cools our 1244 square foot home from our living room, down our hallway, and into our bedrooms with the windows cracked on very hot days!|Positive
Soft touch controls work well.easy to install & use. Unlike other coolers which do not come with a motor or wiring, this model is ready to run, just plug it in.|Positive
one lip broke about 5 hours after started running|Negative
It works great ease to pour the water|Positive
It was the perfect fit for my home|Positive
Simple to set up and effective. Kept our living room cool and comfortable|Positive
Can't speak to its durability yet, but it is doing the job! Just be sure you are asking it to do the right job. In this case, I live in a semi-arid climate where the humidity is running around 30%, so an evaporative cooler was appropriate. Then, I was trying to support my ac, not replace it. My home office (about 100 sf) is on the southwest corner of my house and it just bakes; to be comfortable in there in the late afternoon, I have to over-cool the rest of the house. And since I work in the afternoons a lot, something had to change. I didn't want the expense of another AC unit and didn't want to mess with venting. Enter this cooler. It came today, it was nasty in the office, I plugged it in and right away, it was better because I set it to blow on me, and after a bit, I could move it away as it had cooled the office so it was cooler than in the rest of the house. Downsides: a bit big, but manageable; a bit noisier than I would have liked; I'll probably need to turn it off when I'm on the phone, but if the room is cool, that shouldn't be a big problem for short spells. I would like a lower fan speed; it would help on the noise and be less likely to move papers on my desk, but that speed is necessary for the evaporation to work, so it is a trade.|Positive
It seems to be working real well & better on the roof top swamp cooler- then the old 1/2 hp motor|Positive
Bought this at local store. Product was returned as it didn't work. Replaced with the same motor as I thought that maybe I got a bad one. The second motor doesn't work either. Very poor product.|Negative
Nothing special, except maybe the price, for corrugated cardboard?|Negative
this product exceeded my expectations. I have bought 3 more since my original purchase.|Positive
This the third mastercool unit I've owned for different houses. The air feels much like AC in that it's cold like AC but not overly humid like your typical swamp cooler. Even during the humid monsoon season this unit gets us through quite comfortably! I've got mine connected to a thermostat and couldn't be happier!!|Positive
Exactly what I needed and at an affordable price!!|Positive
Works very well in my garage. 108 out in Az and I can still enjoy working in my garage.|Positive
This fan is good and is easy to carry. It's cooling ability is just what I thought it would be.|Positive
Easy install|Positive
this item started working fine in the first few days not the only thing that work is the fan. I filled the water reservoir since last week and the water still there I think the water pump is out .|Negative
Sprinkler pipe broke put yhe portacool on in this 100 plus heat to fix it really helped|Positive
looks good, perfect fit|Positive
did not provide any cooling relief - basically it was an overpriced fan-- I returned it after 10day of trying|Negative
I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. I use this product for my small 8x12' greenhouse. I must mention that I live in Central California where the outside humidity is often around 20% or less... and the summers can get to be well over 100 degrees. This cooler seems to be able to keep my greenhouse around 15 degrees cooler then it would normally be. I think the construction is as good as it can be for plastic. The only real problem I can see is, if you over-fill the tank the fan will dip down into the water... which I think is a bad thing. So don't fill it higher then MAX and you will be ok. I would purchase this product again.|Negative
"We used this unit on our patio, so the heat definitely did it in very quickly. The unit has a water level sensor that is part of the pump electronics and cannot be disconnected. After several weeks, the sensor failed to the ""low water"" state and prevented the pump from running even when the water level was fine. The company quickly shipped us a replacement unit when we called, but that unit failed faster than the first one. The unit may work well indoors, but it didn't meet our needs."|Negative
Doesn't run as long without water refill as advertised|Positive
home depot sells the cooler , home depot online has the part for sale and not available DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . THEY REFER YOU TO THE MANUFACTURER|Negative
Works well. Easy to install and adjust. Well made sturdy.|Positive
Your information on your product is extensive and has the information needed to make the decision on what you actually need|Positive
We expected the humidity to rise, of course however, the temperature of the air also rose considerably. We returned the product the next day.|Negative
Light weight and cheap. Does a fair job. Buy it onlybif your needs are limited to one small room.|Negative
Easy set up, everything works. It was 105° today. My patio was 80°! Not only are we ejoying the poolside patio more than ever, but my plants are loving it, too. I think they will all make it to fall for the very first time ever. I am very happy with this purchase.|Positive
Great product! Cools a large space.|Positive
It's took five different installers to get this thing working, but now it's finally working well.|Positive
After only a few months of use the first year, I started the second year having to replace the cheaply made belt which not only spewed black gunk all over the inside of the cooler but also started shredding apart. In addition, the pump went out at the beginning of the season. Cools great when it works but very disappointed at the cheap parts! GO AMERICAN!!|Positive
2200 sq ft ranch floor plan, bought two of these. Outside temp is 90 degrees, inside is 75 degrees.|Positive
Simply put, best value and best quality, far better than honneywell or luma comfort, this cooler is a beast at 2200 cfm and Holds over 10 gallons of water in the tank and comes with direct garden hose hook up, remember its an evap cooler not an air conditioner so you need airflow to make it work, seems odd to place it by an open window and open another window on opposite side of room when its 100 degrees but it works great, put it outside to cool your patio or inside to cool and humidify your home, no regrets highly recommend|Positive
Great Product, I use it in my warehouse and it seems to drop the temp by about 10 to 12 degrees. I plan on ordering a couple more since this seems to work this well to help cool the rest of my warehouse down.|Positive
It was time to replaced my 20 year old Phoenix (Wall mounted) with this new Champion. They just don't make um like they used too was may first impression...It is a lot lighter. 1) Pre-installation required the tightening the majority of hardware....loosened in shipping I guess. 2) The water inlet holes are drilled on the far Frame Support Bars. Isn't most water supply near the home? I drilled a new hole and installed float. 3) I also noticed the Air Inlet Tunnel was not squire to the main box. This would effect the leveling process of main box it not correct before installation. 4) I replaced the Aspen pads with CoolPad. Better water circulation. In the specs it states this is for Wall or Window mount. It is definitely designed for Window. Going into this I new I would have to slightly modify the wall opening or inlet tube. The unit is installed and working fantastic. We just had a couple warm days and the unit cooled the house faster than the old. Oh did I mention the remote control? Who says you need one... till you got one. Makes life just that much easier. Tried to add pictures but they say the pixel height is to short....huh|Positive
Use this to control water level in spill basin of our infinity edge swimming pool. Much more robust than flimsy plastic parts typically used by swimming pool companies. Surprisingly this superior part actually costs less than the “cheap plastic” ones at pool supply company. Works great!|Positive
The cooler cooled the house. Is was easy to get it going.|Positive
Don’t waste the money! Had it now for about 12 months and the controls don’t work so I just turn it on and hope. It’s a use a one time product at best.|Negative
Works just fine, Just wish they had a bigger model!|Positive
Easy to install and works fine.|Positive
Far exceeded my expectations. I just purchased another as a gift. Love the new lower price also.|Positive
Very affordable and easy to install. As long as you can reach the cooler and open it yourself, don't bother calling a repair person.|Positive
My house does not have air conditioner, it just has a rooftop Evaporative/swamp cooler. We do not use the rooftop swamp cooler as it is a pain to set up and take down. It also leaks. So we have been surviving the heat with just fans but wanted something more without the expense of AC. So I decided to try this portable Evaporative Cooler, to see if it could keep the house cooler. It was easy to set up and fill up with water. The unit was much quieter than my fan which is pictured next to the cooler. I really like that it has wheels to move from room to room. I am also able to lift the unit so I can carry it upstairs if needed for sleeping. The timer will be great for sleeping. This cooler arrived just as it was getting hot here. My husband was busy putting together a shelving unit for me and started to complain that it was hot in the house so I turned on the Evaporative Cooler. The room was about 250 sqft and it felt cooler. The air coming out of the cooler was actually cold. I liked that it cooled the room without air blowing in my face. The temperature outside was 90 and this cooler kept the room that we were in quite comfortably. When I stopped to take a break from working and sat still for a while I felt cold. When I placed the ice packs in the bottom, the air that came out was very cold. I will be using this instead of my tower fans as it does a better job with less noise. I also like that the cool air can be felt by all in the room and does not need to be placed close to a person to feel it. unlike my tower fans that would only be felt in half the room and blow air in your face.|Positive
The removable water reservoir makes it really easy to add water. Remote is a real asset.|Positive
I have now had two of these units. The first one the pump switch or pump was broken, which Home Depot gladly replaced with their floor model since it was the last one they had. The second one worked fine for awhile but has developed a leak somewhere. I will be returning the second unit today (7-24-18) and getting a refund.|Negative
This only cools if your sitting within 2 feet of it. It is a waste of money|Negative
IT COOLS MY HOUSE . I LOVE IT|Positive
A BIG DIFFERENCE I JUST LOVE IT.|Positive
No only because the space I had was too small and it was just too hot it couldn’t cool down the room|Negative
It's about an inch too short vertically, and your house will reek of wet cardboard for a couple days. Aside from that, it still works well and beats paying $80 for the next brand|Positive
Installed in less then half an hour!!|Positive
Fits our evaporative cooler perfectly! Very pleased.|Positive
It's been amazing|Positive
This is the biggest disappointment ever. Everything it says it does.......IT DOESN'T ! I have an old fan that is about 17 years old, blows out more cold air than product. I've poured ice water in the tank and it doesn't even produce much chill. I'm surprised HOME DEPOT would even allow this to be on their shelf.|Negative
Great product for money, does better job than port a cool that is twice its size|Positive
The cover fit our cooler perfect. Great product.|Positive
Cover fits great. Can't wait to use new cooler next summer.|Positive
Nice, clean R2D2-type design, intuitive controls/remote, easy to fill with water, easy to move around the house. Be aware that this will not cool an entire room if it's hot. You need to be right in front of it - in which case the cool breeze is great; however, it's noisy even on low speed.|Positive
We were able to get 2 units donated to us from Portacool. They were great. We had a couple of hiccups with the units that were swiftly and efficiently dealt with an excellent outcome. We are an FFA Chapter in Florida and our shaggy black steers for the county fair can get quite warm and hot at the fair. This leads to issues with my students trying to control a 1200 pound animal that is hot and cranky. We used these units on our animals and they seemed to react positively to their experience. Thank you, Portacool for supporting the FFA.|Positive
For as small as it is ...I cools very well, and I would recommend it in a bedroom it is so quiet, I'm not use to them being so quiet.|Positive
The low price is the reason for purchase I had a 4500cfm factory pump and this year the heat kept drying out pads So far this pump keeps them wet and house cooler|Positive
Solid and heavy duty, Solid brass construction means it will last at the valve.|Positive
We love it. It does exactly what it’s advertised to do. Summers here are near 98° with an avg 60% humidity. This has made sitting and playing with the kids outside bearable.|Positive
Waayyy better than expected, feature packed too!|Positive
string was a little small at the bottom|Positive
This really does’t cool, and the instructions were vauge. The fan setting works fine, but air never got cooler with water and ice used. I dont think it was worth the money just to use as a fan.|Negative
I bought this for my garage and thought the portability would be good inside the house as well. This is only good in small spaces and if you have a hose hookup nearby. I am filling this thing up every 2 hours. I should have bought a window unit. Install and turn on. I don't know the return process but I'm probably gonna sell it|Negative
We live in the High Desert so need cool and humidity. This works fairly well. We use a lot of ice. Fairly quiet and compact. The experience with the seller was perfection.|Positive
Fits my ac unit perfectly and very durable. My last one didn't have any strings to tie and blew away after 2 weeks. Cover is perfect for what I need it for.|Positive
Product was as expected . Good instructions and worked well The only issue I had was that for the first week of usage the cooler had a strong smell in the rooms from the cardboard I would recommend either fixing this or giving instructions to get rid of the smell. A cooler guy told me to add Downey fabric softener to get rid of the smell and this did help|Positive
I bought this for my office where it gets so hot I can't breathe sometimes. It circulates and cools the air to my liking without venting.|Positive
I just bouth this for the grandparents. Worked great. They both are very happy with it. I just wished it wasnt so costly. I would recommend this product.|Positive
The float was a good price. It was easy install and adjust. Very happy this item.|Positive
I put it on a thermostat controller and it works great I set it and has done exactly what we needed it to do|Positive
yes love it works well .i own 3 of them . works great in arizona dry heat . but not when humid|Positive
I live in Chicago where the summers are very hot and humid. My standard oscillating fan always did the job, but I had been hearing things about tower fans and how effective they are at cooling down a space. So i decided to give one a try. Ordered this one at a good price and waited for it to arrive. Oh my goodness it is wonderful! It pushes so much air at you its like a wind tunnel. It has a cooling feature which is quite nice, and an ion feature which helps filter the surrounding air. This is an amazing fan! I highly highly recommend it.|Positive
I am sooooo pleased with this portable evaporative cooler. It works Fantastic, nothing to do except add water, turn it on & enjoy!!! Love it! Use it every day!|Positive
"Easy to install and with this winter already colder than the previous, what an ideal cover to help keep the heat in! I always put the canvas cover on the outside, but this year the wind was pushing through the canvas and cold air was making the living room crazy cold. Just pop the cover on and ""Presto"" the cold stays outside where it belongs."|Positive
Stop rain from entering thri the turbines on the roof.|Positive
The Evaporative Cooler was not easy to install, but once we did, it was a relief to have working!|Positive
I thought this was going to be something I would need help with, but the product is light and very easy to install. The instructions were easy to follow.|Positive
Works great in 5 minutes had it covered for winter, DONE!!|Positive
I was hoping this was a solid shaft but when I received it , it was a hollow shaft so had to return it|Negative
I bought this cooler for my greenhouse during the summer months. It does help keep things cool as desired. Note: The switches were in spanish though. The product also came with a few dents. Also the vent wings were individually manually adjustable. No thermostat or water hookup kit is included.|Positive
It works fine. It is just like many others. Nothing t rava about nothing to complain. I just does its job|Negative
Now my Champion Cooler is blowing colder again. Perfect fit, easy installation. What more could you ask for?|Positive
Good quality.|Positive
"It's kind of loud, and didn't cool an 800 sq. ft. apartment that has a ""sun facing brick"" side all the way. :|"|Negative
Works great for my 3000 sf house up to outside temp of 105 degrees. Very happy with it.|Positive
Very small could not use it it has to be the bigger one|Negative
my cooler is 15 years old. the replacement i purchased fit like a glove|Positive
This unit is nice and slim but not very durable, within less than 3 months of use motor overheats causing it to shut off. I'm faced with having to buy a new motor, Phoenix Manufacturing won't replace, bad warranty.|Negative
The product did exactly what I needed it to do. It covered the swamp cooler with a little slack left (which was perfect) and I was able to finish the job within an hour. Very good product.|Positive
Moves air up to our work space. Couldn't make it through the summer without it.|Positive
"I gave this product one star for its mobility and one for easy functioning such as remote and side door for adding more water. However this product doesn't work and didn't cool a thing. We bought it to try because our AC went out for 5 days and we were trying to cool down the living room. Instead, our living room got 2 degrees warmer with this product and really muggy. We thought let's try it in the garage for our ""gym"" before we return it. That was useless too since all it did was blow around hot air, we couldn't feel any cool air even after adding ice. In essence, this product is simply a very overpriced floor fan! We returned it."|Negative
Haven't fired it up yet but water distributor spider broke & am getting a new one. (I always reduce the aperture on the tubes; too much water on the pads otherwise). Right-hand vent does not produce appreciable air. This is because the two fan wheels (squirrel cages) are misaligned. Could not realign the right one. But i think total air flow is OK. Looks like a nice unit all in all.|Positive
This is a great cooler for patios and courtyards. I cools some of my house also. I have the big one installed in a wall on my garage|Positive
Great fit in our 14 inch swamp cooler duct. Will insulate better than the various items we have used in the past (old pillows, foam from the craft store, etc...). The cover seems heavy and should stand up to many years of use and the occasional cleaning when necessary. The one thing I did notice is that this had a VERY strong smell when it first arrived, so you may wan to let it air out somewhere before you install it.|Positive
The part was well packed, arrived promptly and met all expectations.|Positive
It fit just right.|Positive
This is an amazing evaporative cooler! I wish I had purchased one year ago. A lot of thought went into its design, it runs quietly and automatically adjusts it speed or turns off as temperature conditions change. No more old school selector switch you forget to adjust that runs the motor full load day and night using a lot more energy. I don't have to climb on the roof to clean out the moss and stinky swamp gunk that often occurs at the worst of times in the old style coolers. This system is self cleaning by pumping out old water before it can turn. To add life to the MasterCool cooling media I installed a dedicated small 10,000 grain RV water softener. Neat, Neat setup!|Positive
Item met all expectations for size and quality|Positive
Easy to install. I added additional cord to reduce flapping in wind|Positive
The overall cooling ability is barely adequate for 600 sq. ft. It's noisy, the controls are almost impossible for an elderly person such as myself to operate. They are recessed and you have to stick your fingers inside to turn the dial. Very difficult. Also it lacks the most basic air flow controls. You can control it side to side but not up and down. I would give it a fair rating at best. Entry level evaporative cooling.|Negative
Unless you are sitting 3 feet in front of the machine, it's pretty useless.|Negative
It is doing exactly what it is supposed to do.|Positive
Easy to place on cooler and with draw strings makes it very secure. Covers completely and material should last for years.|Positive
The manufacturer states these are good for FIVE years but after only TWO summers my pads became brittle and started to fall apart. That amounts to $45.00 per year for the pads. If there was an alternative I would seriously look into it.|Negative
Opened it up, connected the hose, turned it on and works great! We love it.|Positive
Simple to install.|Positive
Started pumping right off. It was easy to install|Positive
Save Your Money. 2nd one I have returned due to a faulty water pump. Cheap Chinese Garbage.|Negative
Motor was frozen up and would not turn right out of the box.|Negative
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT EVAPORATIVE FANS I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT ITS COOLING ABILITIES.FEAR NOT IT COOLED A 140 SQUARE FOOT ROOM IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINIUTES. I HAD TOO LOWER IT DURING THE NIGHT IT WAS GETTING REALLY CHILLY.THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKED PERFECTLY I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF BED TO LOWER THE TEMPERTURE.A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT, I LIKED IT SO MUCH I PURCHASED A SECOND ONE.|Positive
It Belted like no Belt has belted before.|Positive
Replaced existing pump same model Works as expected|Positive
It leaks once turns on cool and it doesn’t cool very well|Negative
This cover fits perfect. It is well made and should last several years.|Positive
The water distribution peice came broken so I returned the unit. The design was really nice but I will never know if it really works. I am somewhat skeptical that the unit will really keep anything cool|Negative
These tie-down straps are real easy to put on your swamp cooler.|Positive
perfect fit|Positive
the cooler is good . If you pick up at store be sure to check under the cooler for dents if it s not on a cardboard packing crate. I took one that was unpacked and it had dents in the bottom from handling. I took it back and got one that was still in packing. Other wise the cooler is good, my other one that this one replaced has been on the roof for 20 years.|Positive
The faceplate is not on properly. It keeps coming loose. But the unit works well.|Negative
The cooler is working great to cool my 950 sq ft condo. Great price.|Positive
It’s perfect for my desk|Positive
We bought this and live in Colorado where Air Conditioners really don't work because we are so dry here. I have grown up with Evaporated coolers all my life, most of the bad reviews on here complain about humidity, this is going to be a problem with all of them because well, that's how they work. BUT this thing really is junk, I thought maybe it would help just a little, nope. We got it home, turned it on and it didn't do anything, the temp was the same. I was sitting about 5 feet from it with my bare feet toward it and I couldn't feel anything. You are better off buying a big fan, this thing hardly puts out any air or cooling effects. I thought maybe I had it in a too big of a room so I put it in a tiny bedroom with the door closed, nothing. It was just as hot but a heck of a lot more humid. It just takes up electricity and gives absolutely nothing back. We returned it to Home Depot for a full refund.|Negative
just the right size|Positive
good quality, great price and large enough to fit any roof vent turbine. exceeded my expectations except in color. Would have preferred silver or black.|Positive
Put this in my Port-A-Cool to rid it of bad odors. Still have the same odor. Did not help at all. All I can tell it has done is oxidize all the metal parts in the cooler. All the metal has a white powdery covering now. Can't be good.|Negative
Great cooler and fan, lower hum-so relatively quiet. It drips and is soothing. Good power, easy to fill and drain (plug is underneath), just roll it out to the porch. I'm very happy with this purchase.|Positive
Works well when it works. Fan has never failed, but replacement filters are 1/5 the cost of the entire unit. They recommend replacing every season I think, but I got 2 years out of them before it looked like they needed to be replaced. My biggest complaint is I have had 2 controllers fail in 3 years, now I have to buy a third. These slim line coolers are great, but I would recommend a different brand. I have hear of a brand called Bon-Aire. Might try that one if I experience a 3rd failed control unit.|Negative
The bearings are not real strong so you have to adjust your pulley to run the belt a little looser than you'd like or the belt tension causes the motor to overheat and turn off. The down side of a belt being a little loose is the fan doesn't blow as hard and you may have some excessive noise from the swamp cooler. But, it's the cheapest motor and it works as long as you don't tension the belt as much as you'd like. You get what you pay for.|Positive
The cooler is quite large. Better suited for outdoor use rather than indoors. Easy to fill with water and move around different parts of the house as needed. Fan can be considered loud, but not excessive. The cooler is much quieter when using the water pump and the pads are wet. Does the job. Yesterday well over 100 here in California and with the extreme low humidity lowered the tempature of the room it was cooling from 92 when I arrived home at 5:00pm to 78 within 45 minutes. Best to cycle the water pump though to avoid excessive humidity build up, even with a window cracked open. Only con with the unit is lack of timer to set auto shut off, otherwise pretty good cooler for low humidity climes.|Positive
works fine just what I needed|Positive
Good design with good material. It works as advertised. The only draw back is that it should have come with a owner's manual explaining just how the float/ water level gauge works. Using a direct hose connection set up I could only get the water reservoir half full. Only after taking the back off of it did I find out. The float shuts the water down when the gauge is at half full. I only use the low fan setting because it has a very powerful fan! I use it on my patio. It gets the job done!!|Positive
Keeps our small 1700 Sq Ft house around 74 degrees in 102 degree Hgh Desert heat. Installation only took a couple hours. Nice low-profile in the window. Runs smooth and quiet; and remote is extremely handy. We use high speed blower to clear hot air out, then put it on low to stay cool. With the 10% military discount, we paid less than advertised price - including delivery! Be sure to purchase water connection parts separately before starting installation. You will need at minimum, 10 Ft of 1/4 in.copper tubing and the appropriate supply-side hose-bib or saddle valve connector.|Positive
Everything went together nicely. You can actually take the unit apart and haul it up a roof if need be. Mine was sort of destroyed when I got it unboxed at home. It was going to be too much of a hassle to take back. Although it does look bad, it works, too bad I don't have all the time int the world to exchange it. Seems to get cool quick though and would have got a 5 star except for the damage and you have to buy a motor...but it is quiet and hope it don't rust...!|Positive
Well worth it. Fit tight and work good. The new pad smell goes away after the first couple of days.|Positive
This is the best product i have found that helps with the hard water build up on my pads. Ive been using this product since March 2017.|Positive
"We purchased this unit for our 1800 square foot warehouse in August 2017. It cooled the warehouse by least 20 degrees and we are very pleased. However, after 30 days, the water gauge quit working. Not a major problem and we can deal with it. Last week, the ""swing"" feature stopped working. This week, the fan stopped working. We got the fan working, but the gauge and swing still do not work. We can live with that. The machine has a great warranty; however, the customer must return the unit for repairs. This is pretty much impossible. It would have go to by freight. We do not have the pallet packaging and forklift to accomplish this. Plus that is expensive. I would think that this product should perform as advertised for at least a year, if not more. This is not a toy. It is a very large, heavy machine that should not break within 30 days. Truly disappointing."|Negative
The instructions mention if you have a hollow shaft (most are) you will need a shaft plug to use the puller. The plug did not come with the puller and the Home Depot where I got it did not have them. I had to improvise a plug to use the puller. After several more trips to Home Depot and back trying to find something that would work, I finally got the pully and bearings off the shaft. Also, not so great at pulling the rounded bearings off.|Negative
the item only had three sides not good.|Negative
It's the best ever swamp cooler I have had|Positive
Bought this unit for our office untill our air conditioner is fixed.We have 2 of these in our vacation house in Baja Mexico which really helps in the summer heat as we run them around the clock.|Positive
The cover is good but the assistance from Home Depot online support was excellent. They were very punctual in finding the information I needed.|Positive
The item was just as what and what we needed, no problems!|Positive
I really like the product but am only giving it a 3 cause the item I received wasn't new. The unit was scratched up and the water level gauge was stuck to the inside the box and not the plastic sheet covering the unit. It works really well and I would recommend it.|Negative
For the money this is the best bang for the buck! I bought this to cool my garage and to use in our warehouse at work. It does well to cool the section I use it for at work!|Positive
I am very pleased with this unit that I bought another one for another room. It does the job I need it to for the rooms I purchased them for. Even just using the fan alone did wonders. it is for rooms not whole house.|Positive
easy to install. does exactly what it should do.|Positive
Works well.|Positive
Used it for about 6 weeks then it began to leak. They did let me return it and now looking for another similar product.|Negative
Fit well and seems like sturdy construction.|Positive
The Evaporative Cooler Motor is running great, cooling very well, and is very quite. Thank you.|Positive
They work great cuz those r the only ones that will fit a Bonaire cooler that size. Thank u|Positive
Using this to cool off a 2 car garage in the summer heat. The garage was to hot to do anything. Since buying this, the garage is comfortable enough to get back to doing projects.|Positive
Used to cover a Tradewinds cooler. Fit OK, just a little big, but these things tend to shrink a little over time so it should be just right next year. It met my expectations.|Positive
I got this for my garage at the beginning of July. In Texas... My two car garage is a little larger than the square footage this unit claims to cool, so I expected it would not be a perfect solution. I only expected it to be cooler than a fan blowing hot air at me. Having been through two weeks of 100+ temps outside, I thought I should share the details. For clarity, I have insulated my garage door. And my office is out here due to lack of space in the house. With an outdoor temp of 90 or below, this unit keeps me very comfortable when using refrigerated water (I keep gallon jugs in the fridge). Over 90 degrees however is what it is. Challenging any AC unit. But I must say adding ice with a strategic method solves the problem. The key is, this thing holds a little over 5 gallons of water. It is easier to keep one gallon cold than 5. So I allow the unit to get just above the low level indicator (leaving somewhere in between one and two gallons) and add a ten pound bag of ice. That lasts for around two hours before the temp starts warming due to the ice melting. You could also drain it and start over after the ice melts if needed. So overall, I am very happy with this and I'd recommend it after making sure your square footage is within it's capacity. This beats the two fans I had at any level of comparison.|Positive
Love it. Cools the house great, even on low. It is a little loud, but it's in the living room.|Positive
Had to return it because the motor got overheated after the first use|Negative
This is the third swamp cooler we have had. I was replacing with the same model. The last one we only had for 3 summers, but I forgot to oil the fan and it froze up and burned the motor up. So let's hope this lasts longer. But what can I say it's a cooler like all the rest, there are not many choices. It cools our main floor which is about 900 sq feet.|Positive
Side-Draft unit is very efficient but I have a complaint. I seems to provide too much water on one side and not enough in the middle and right side.|Positive
I live in central CA and was looking for a cooling method to prevent AC usage. This unit is easily moved to different areas, although it's bigger than I pictured. Kinda like a dryer in size. Cools well and can be taken outside. Wishing it had an auto shut off when water is low. So you have to keep an eye. But it's lasted about 8 hrs when filled.|Positive
product was as advertised.|Positive
I Love The concept of this product, it did not Live up to reviews I read. It was way too much work to get cool going ice and the cool didn't last long. Definitely follow with this one Cross ventilation is a must.|Negative
Fit well. The only problem is that the ties are not sturdy enough in our wind prone area, so I had to use bungee cords to hold it in place.|Positive
Very easy to find through Home Depot online. All of my questions were answered by an associate over the phone, and delivered promptly and accurately. The motor has been installed, and is working great.|Positive
nice machine|Positive
this is an excellent cooler. we have a Bonair which is wonderful, and this one is also. the NewAir has more airflow than the Bonair and it is smaller, if size is a consideration for you. the Bonair is easier to fill with a bigger opening, but filling the NewAir is not difficult. they seem to cool equally. i would completely recommend this product.|Positive
Cooled my living room very fast and yes I would recommend this to anyone.|Positive
Product as described, fast delivery, great price!|Positive
Not really much to say. I installed the motor and it works just like it should. The one before this lasted about 7 years and I run it almost 24/7 in the summer.|Positive
The cover fit great & in my opinion was worth the money. Ordered it on line and picked it up at the store. ~~~~~~~~HAPPY,HAPPY,HAPPY.~~~~~~~~ ral.|Positive
Fit easily, instructions clear, arrived on time. Too soon to know how long they last.|Positive
I am currently using this for my room, it is not really cold but blows enough to not make it terribly hot. I live in El Paso and it is always over 100* degrees so you can't tell if it is working well or not.|Negative
I love my Swamp cooler. I have a 2100 sf house and it hit 99 degrees today it felt comfortable. Remind you it for a 1600 sf house.|Positive
It hasent worked right since i got it. Wanted. The Hisense but you were out of stock. I schould of waited for it to be back in stock.Your employee in your store helped me order it she was great. I love home Depot. Not this product|Negative
I have replaced this Dial switch about every other year. The first one (not a Dial brand switch) lasted for 20+ years. These Dial brand switches are cheaply made (but highly priced) and last only a couple of years. So lower your expectations. I wish home depot would carry a different brand.|Negative
Thiese are great.|Positive
Fit our Bonair Durango 5900 perfectly. Lightweight but strong. Happy with this purchase!|Positive
"I tried it in the window first on the second floor of a quad level house. The main entry, garage door, rear deck door and laundry room are on this level. Each level is connected by a split level stairway in the center of the house. The bottom level is partially below grade and stays pretty cool on its own. The upper level master bedroom gets the southwestern exposure and is farthest away. After a good window test of a few days, I put in the north wall next to the washer dryer. The dog ( a very thick haired golden retriever) uses the laundry for home and has a dog door to the deck. She loves the cooler air from a few feet away. I keep the window closed on this level and let some of the air escape on the main level at the patio/deck door and kitchen window on the third level. The remainder of the cool air pushes up to the fourth level and out the window of the master bedroom. By this point the air is not as cool but still doing a half decent job, considering the cooler is on the low setting. Cool air naturally wants to drop but didn't make the lower floor cold (good news). The largest window opening on the fourth level allows a good portion of the cool air to move upward and i couldn't ask for a room unit to do any more than this. I am very pleased that it performs this well under these conditions. I will have an A/C unit on the upper floor master bedroom for the hottest days (upper 90's) with the door closed and will enjoy the fresh air from the cooler most other times. I chose the lower floor location as the unit could be placed at the back of the house in an inconspicuous location next to a water tap. I din't want to have to do maintenance from a ladder if I didn't have to. The unit is easy to install with good directions and can be done with one person(easier with two). I installed a 20 1/4"" wood framed box for the fan tunnel to pass through. The front section lifts nicely after four screws are removed. I was a bit concerned after reading reviews as I am very chemical sensitive. There was the normal slight scent of wet paper and no chemical oder at all. The water bleed off is a plus in any cooler and should not be obstructed. This is what will keep your cooler smelling fresh and keep the pads clear. The water loss is minimal. VERY PLEASED"|Positive
"Weak in cooling; and virtually impossible to service motor bearings -- two ""squirrel cage"" fans and non-removable sides add up to there being no reasonable way to oil bearings -- and very minimal directions indicate that the bearing may or may not need oiling. My first cooler lasted two seasons before the motor froze up. I trashed the cooler."|Negative
so far has been a great addition to my trailer, havent had it installed long enough to see any real energy savings as yet. next summer will tell the story|Positive
I'm using this evaporative cooler in my garage workshop to help keep the air circulating in there and to keep me cooler while working on DIY projects. I don't use the evaporative cooler option because my garage already has a lot of humidity and has had moisture/mold issues before, so I keep the humidifying option off. I like that it's forceful and keeps things circulating in what could become a very stale garage! Good quality unit and very easy to transport due to the wheels.|Positive
Love my Luma Evaporative cooler! Cools my hot cathedral ceiling room very fast and blows out lots of cold air, especially if you use very cold water on very hot days. After three months had a problem with a part and Mark in the Customer Service did a great job to get it replaced. He was fast, friendly and thorough. Great ac and great Customer Service!|Positive
I had used for 20 years a conventional type downdraft steel body evaporative cooler with a two speed 3/4hp motor with a squirrel cage blower. When comparing the noise between the two evaporative coolers. The noise is a little different but not noisier than a conventional evaporative cooler. Bonaire uses a Axial fan instead of a conventional belt driven squirrel cage blower. The high speed fan setting is only temporary upon initial start up on a hot day but will get the indoor temperature down quickly within minutes then drops down to a lower fan speed to maintain a lower indoor temperature. I have this model Bonaire 5000 CFM evaporative cooler on my rooftop of a 1500+ sq. ft. tri level house.and it will maintain indoor temperature around 71 degrees on low fan speed throughout the day when outside temperatures have reached 75 degrees or higher. This using a 1/3 hp fan motor saving more money using less power. I mated the Bonaire evaporative cooler with a Masterstat digital temp. controller that has a media pre-wetting feature before the fan turns on. Together with this temp. controller the evaporative cooler works really well and I won't have to worry about this evaporative cooler rusting out like my old one did. Time will tell how many years I will get from this evaporative cooler, but so far I am impressed with the performance of this Bonaire evaporative cooler.|Positive
It doesn't seem to cool the room much better than a fan. I use it in a small bedroom|Negative
Great quality, timely delivery, excellent value!|Positive
This tower fan is pretty easy to install and operate. You need to fill the water tank to use the cooling feature. It also comes with a gel cooling pack, which broke apart on the first cooling cycle. This is not a big deal since you can use other gel packs as well. However, the one thing I did not like was that fins are pretty light and they tend to make creaking noise when the swing mode is on. Other than that the fan is pretty efficient in cooling a medium sized room. I liked it for the fact that I do not have to use a separate humidifier in my place where it tends to get drier during the hot weather. Overall its a decent fan if the creaking noise does not bother you much.|Positive
Works very well but does seem to be a little noisy.|Positive
It gets the job done but when it is fully tighten the spout is faceing the wrong way.|Negative
Easy to use snd blows good|Positive
"Pretty good quality cover, fits well, easy to install. Seems kind of thin but is real canvas so I'm positive it will last several years unlike the last 2 covers I purchased from different manufacturers. I am pleased to find a good quality canvas cover again. It would be nice if it came with a couple of ""wind straps"" to wrap around the middle but I came up with something easy enough. Overall very happy with the purchase including a decent price."|Positive
Not a very good swamp cooler I’m in northern Cali and in the heat of the summer 0 percent humidity would not cool down a 500 sq fr yurt we bought a win to swamp cooler and it works great. I would not recommend this product|Negative
We got this for our central a/c condenser unit outside. It installs quick and easy with a draw-string The Heavy-duty Hurricane fabric provides maximum all-season weather and UV protection for evaporative coolers, or a/c condensers. A bit big for our A/C unit but it works Keeps dirt, debris and weather out of the motor, prolonging the life of the a/c unit. Looks attractive, holds up to big winds and rain. Very happy with this!|Positive
I have had nothing but problems with this model. A few weeks after we purchased this product it just stopped working and had to be exchanged...same model but another unit. I figured maybe it was just a bad unit, it happens some time. No, I now believe it is just this model. It worked for about a month or so, and then it began working intermittently. I will have to purchase another pump for next season. I previously had a different model by the same manufacturer and it worked like a champ for about 3 years!|Negative
Fit was great|Positive
So far so good, it’s about a month of usage.|Positive
Perfect fit. Works great.|Positive
great cover, really heavy duty canvas. I only gave it 4 stars because the draw string needs to be a heavier gauge, cover is a perfect fit,very heavy duty|Positive
It does not change the temperature of a 10x12 room. There is slightly cool air if you are seated right in front of it and use the ice packs, otherwise it's no different than any other nonevaporative fan out there. Very disappointed|Negative
Great product!|Positive
I was surprised and disappointed at how flimsy and cheap the plastic is - especially at a price north of $400. When I got it home the water level meter didn't work, the pump sounded as if it were on it's last leg and the hose water inlet wouldn't let water in. The fan moves a terrific amount of air but the actual cooling power was unimpressive and seemed to disappear if the water level dropped to less than half and having to continuously pour water in the front flap just reminded me constantly of how the panels fit poorly because of how cheap the plastic is. It's supposed to be plug-n-play so I went straight to work in my 110 degree Arizona 2 car garage and while it was better than the portable air conditioner I had tried, and way better than nothing, I was left feeling it could have been better. Not wanting to admit I had made a bad buy, I took a panel off to poke around inside and found that the water pump had come out of it's mount and wedged upside down against the float for the water level gauge while the water inlet float hadn't been installed correctly and was stuck closed. There was also a shocking amount of debris floating around inside from the factory and I was fishing pieces of plastic and the pad media trimmings out of the bottom from around where the motor was supposed to be. Once the components were situated correctly and working properly it got much better. It cools better and pumps much quieter now, the hose inlet works and is very convenient and the smell that many others mentioned went away with the debris I had washed out of the bottom. The tool tray on the top is surprisingly convenient and this thing now comes with me wherever I'm working outside as we're still in triple digits but I no longer have to wait until the middle of the night for it to be cool enough to do anything! It's still cheap plastic that puts out so much air that its own directional vanes will flap in it's own breeze, but I'm happy with it overall and would recommend it.|Positive
The cooler is very easy to operate and cools like it should. I don't have a complaint yet. its perfect and does what its supposed to.|Positive
It's cute and it looks good in the room but I wish I would have got the next size up for more power and cooling. When I put in the water it doesn't seem to make that much difference and the fan only|Negative
The fitment was excellent, and it loogs great, but wow what a noxious smell!!|Positive
Horrible product, will be returning!|Negative
easy to put on and remove, and does the job.|Positive
The cooler works great. the reason I marked it down is champion does not box the coolers so they do not get damaged in the shipping. This is the 3rd or 4th champion that I have bought and all of them came damaged. With a hammer I got it to work, although the doors will always be difficult to take on and off|Positive
So far so good. Next Week we will be having a heat wave of 119 degree temps so that will be the big test. Thank you!|Positive
was so happy to get my cooler so quick, it was very easy to set up with the motor and wiring. my son and a friend put it on the roof and hooked it up in about 15 minuets. love it , it keeps my house nice and cool. thank you|Positive
bought this for my patio and it blows out really strong wind. I place it in one corner and the wind can reach most of the patio. Keeps us comfortable especially during bbq season.|Positive
I ordered this water cooler to use in my garage which can reach 100-degree temperature. I was afraid my freezer would overheat in this high temperature. I ordered the larger unit to be able to handle a 3-car garage. I monitor the garage temperature and turn this baby on when needed--you need to provide some air flow (a door open and garage door up a bit). So far this is a great machine and cools wonderfully and rolls out easily. The only thing that would improve it is a timer on the unit and more suggestions on how to keep the water fresh. I did find an additive for the water, on Amazon, to keep bacteria down.|Positive
Works great on our Patio.|Positive
This cooler is wunnerful!! I keep it on low as it puts out so much COOL air clear across my cabin low setting is all I need. You will love this cooler! It is very quite too. About the same sound as a regular box fan and so cool. Feels almost like a regular air-conditioner without the shocking electric bill at the end of the month. This is the BEST one I have ever had and I've had LARGE roof mount ones before. This one is MUCH cooler!!|Positive
Denser more expensive pads r better but these r good enuff|Positive
It's a little involved to install, but works and looks great.|Positive
I recently bought this cooler for my condo in Denver CO where it’s hot and extremely dry during the summer. From what I read that is the best place to use these kinds of coolers. Today is the first day of 90º heat and the cooler has been running in my 10x12 bedroom all day. I’ve been dumping as much ice into it as possible and it’s sitting next to a window that is cracked open. I’ve read that is what you need to do to get this cooler to work. Well it’s been on the high speed since 7am and the temperature on the cooler right now reads 88º. It’s climbed up from 73º this morning so needless to say I’m not impressed with this thing in the least amount. It also leaks water out of the rubber drain plug so I have the whole unit sitting in a plastic storage bin so it doesn’t leak water onto my carpet. Pretty bummed with the performance of this thing or the lack of performance. I can’t believe New Air’s website states with using ice cubes it can cool a 300sq ft room by 20º - 30º. Haha yeah right. A better option would be for me to stick my head in the freezer. This item will be going back to home depot for a refund this weekend. Don’t waste your time buying this thing. If you really need cooling I’d say spend the extra cash and buy a portable A/C. This New Air 1000W is nothing but a massive let down. It’s truly nothing more than a very expensive ($160) fan. The $16 box fan I have does a better job at cooling.|Negative
This system appeared to have all of the features I was looking for, including the ice tray, but I found it had more going against it. I expected and hoped for more out of this machine, but it did not deliver. It's very loud, even in the sleep mode. The demonstration video showed a baby sleeping. It's definitely too loud for that. It would be nice if it had a slower more mild speed. The size was manageable and it held a decent amount of water. As for cooling, it was fair at best. The machine had a very strong “plastic” smell that was emitted while in operation. The instructions said to run it for a couple of hours to remove the smell. I ran the machine for several days, but the very strong odor did not seem to weaken. The instructions were also incomplete. There is a user guide and a maintenance guide. While reading the instructions, there was a topic that referred me to the second booklet. The second booklet had exactly the same content referring me to the first booklet. The information was not in either of them. I returned the unit due to the strong plastic smell and lack of cooling capability.|Negative
This pump works fine and the price was reasonable. Shipping is a little slow but got it in a timely manner.|Positive
My fan broke and I didn't want any ordinary fan. Texas heat is no joke. Easy to use. Just love it!!!|Positive
The fan works great & overall is a good quality product. The fan was cooling if you sit directly in front of it but it did not cool off the room at all though as a whole. Better than nothing but not a substitute for a/c.|Positive
It’s perfect size, works great and nice clean color|Positive
Great unit! Really cools my 25x20 garage down and now I can work on my projects out there in the Texas’ summers and enjoy doing so! Highly recommend|Positive
Worked great to get my swamp cooler running again.|Positive
Easy to install and works fine|Positive
Works okay as a fan but not as cool as I expected. And pretty loud.|Negative
The cover is doing what it's supposed to do, keeping water out of conditioner.|Positive
I bought this for my enclosed balcony which gets the morning sun doesn't but this fan doesn't cool as much as they said it would so I was a little disappointed so I feel like it was a waste of money.|Negative
Very happy with this purchase. We cool an 80 degree great room for cooking in evening and it is wonderful. A bit noisy, but it is a powerful fan. Going to buy another for a family member.|Positive
"It's perfect for my needs on our outdoor patio. When it comes from Honeywell, it's GREAT! With the ""swing"" feature, it supplies great air movement over a large area."|Positive
I would recommend this product as a humidifier with fan for a nursery grow room. Make sure it's not used even in a box that's taped up. This unit keeps my grow room at 55. As another reviewer wrote, you can not refill the tank easily as the bucket only pulls out 2 inches. It's an evaporative cooler so don't expect it to work miracles in the cooling department. And be very careful when buying boxed items especially at HD. The box of the first unit I took home looked original but inside at home a bug crawled out, there was scum in the bucket and the packaging was missing. Who re-boxes things and puts them for sale like that? Really incompetent. The effort to return the unit and get another cost HD more than they made on it.|Negative
It was the most expensive one listed, and the only model in stock! .....It was needed the same day, so I bought it even though it has more quality than I needed... Nice that it has a bleeder outlet to keep the water fresher...|Positive
only gripe was that the filter stinks. tried to wash it but it continues to stink like....like turtle poo. It comes an goes, i just think in need to clean it more often...after a clean it smells good for a day. other than that, half my house is about 10 deg cooler. It needs more fans along it's path to help distribute the cool air around the house. another gripe is the wheels. installed them but they are hard to turn at times.|Positive
Very happy got this before the fire in Northern California. It is God sent. I was able to sleep at night because of it. Also, it keeps the air clean.|Positive
Arrived two days early. Installation was quick and easy. Cools home much better than the old one it replaced. Quiet operation. Very satisfied.|Positive
easy install and was not as heavy as I thought it would be. got it on roof be myself hint- take off the side panels.|Positive
very easy to operate. Works great...better than any we have owned. Love the oscillating feature. On rollers makes it even better.|Positive
Well made. Great casters so it is easy move! Easy setup! Cooling works great in areas of low humidity!|Positive
The Max Cool was easy to install but, you should high light the instructions a little better to wash and clean the filters before installation so that the smell would go away a little faster.|Positive
Nice heavy canvas and fit well over my cooler!|Positive
works great,easy to install,and even at 100+ degrees it keeps the home cool.|Positive
Excellent, a total life saver in the 104 plus heat in my shop|Positive
Cooler works great looks nice and is perfect for a small bedroom.. I bought it for the living room and eventually it cooled it down after an hour.. unless you sit 5 ft in front of it I would not recommend for a living room or a family..|Negative
can sit on porch in 95+ degree weather|Positive
This fan has helped us get through a Calif summer without air conditioning. Only changes the room temperature by a few degrees but makes you feel very comfortable with the fan blowing in your direction. We have had to cover up at night because we get cold. Would definitely recommend this fan, plus it has had no noticeable effect on our electric bill. The timer feature is very convenient.|Positive
Recently bought a new Mastercool ADA71 and could not find a cover anywhere in town. Found this one online and the order process and delivery was quite easy. Purchased and it fit like a glove.|Positive
the product is pretty red, but doesn't blow as cold as expected. fan is good|Negative
Even with ice water filling it in my dry Colorado climate, this does next to nothing for cooling. Does a fantastic job making the house super muggy and humid though. Just not any cooler|Negative
It's a swamp cooler cover. It covered the swamp cooler the way I expected it to. That's why I bought it.|Positive
I really wish Bonaire would make a directional that replaces what this one has. A set straight air one direction only is what I have. The directional you have does not cover the whole front. This is our 5th year. Love it.....with the exception does not have directional.|Positive
It does keep you cool in your personal space don't expect whole room cooling . Water refills depends on how high you have it example high speed 3 hours low speed mid 6 hours.also keep in mind if the temperature outside is 95 or 100 degrees and your house is hot the breeze you get is minimal. Works good in 80 to 90 degrees. Overall it is the next best thing to a air conditioner for your personal space . So if you buy this cooler don't expect miracle.|Negative
ties came on time, they were long enough and user friendly|Positive
The AC did not cool as much as I expected it to it works okay for the price|Negative
Our Swamp Cooler specs were 1/2 HP 120 amps but we purchased this one that was 3/4 HP 115 amps and it worked great. Our cooler went out in 100 degree weather so we took a chance on the different specs. Come to find out that 115 amps and 120 amps are interchangeable, Im a girl so that fact was not obvious to me. So happy with this product and with our chilled out house.|Positive
This product is solid, well-made and does what it says it will. If you're looking for full heat-exchange A/C capability on the cheap and without venting, It Doesn't Exist and, indeed, this product is not that. But its two advantages over simple air movement ( 1) using evaporation to cool and 2) using ice to make the evaporation source that much colder to begin with ) will buy you an extra 3 degrees F or so in cooling. Timer, speed and oscillation options add to the products value, which, for less than $100, is high.|Positive
"The cover itself fits well. Securing the cover to the cooler is another matter. One of the cords to secure the cover was way too short and effectively useless. I added another cord to make it usable. Also, the cord around the bottom of the cooler runs through 6 loops added to the bottom hem of the cover. Would have cinched up tighter and been more secure if they had run the cord through a channel sewn into the bottom hem. They used this method to run the cord around the side-draft, but used the ""added on loops"" around the bottom perimeter of the cover. We'll see how it holds up to wind and weather."|Negative
The cooler works great! Better than expected. On a 5 star, I say plus 5! Great price, delivery was before given date! No problems, no complaints. I recommend to anyone.|Positive
Relaced 4 sided swamp cooler. Hands down outperformed. Much cooler in kitchen.|Positive
MY HOME IS 1100 SQUARE FEET SO I BOUGHT TWO UNITS AND THEY DO NOT WORK WELL AT ALL I WOULD RETURN THEM BUT i INSTALLED THE IN THE WALL SO CANT RETURN THEM|Negative
I was just happy that I did not have to cut the pads down to fit. I was also surprised that there were 4 pads in the package and not just 3. I double loaded the extra pad to see if it would help with the coolness. I do wonder which pads last better than others. Marge Murdock|Positive
The best cooler we have bought! We have a back deck that catches the west sun and this thing feels like a real A/C. Much better than the Portacool we have and half the price!|Positive
unbeatable qulaity and price delivered on time easy to clean blows ice cold air !|Positive
This is a great product- much better than other portable coolers. The low rating is because the pump switch at the touch button burned out within 2 weeks. The manufacturer wants the entire unit shipped back for inspection, but shipping a giant, lightweight box is cost prohibitive. I just need to replace the circuit assembly. Also - instruction manual not thorough|Negative
Not very cooling at all - a great fan but for $250.00 not worth it. I will be returning it!|Negative
I live in a dry area and this cooler didn't cut it. With 2 windows wide open, the cooler wouldn't really cool more than 5 degrees over the course of 5 hours. Also made my house too humid. I only had 600sq ft to cool.|Negative
the unit was easy to assemble. It was basically plug it in and, add some water and watch it work.|Positive
I expected it to get cooler, but it is fulfilling the purpose at this time.|Negative
Works good. No modifications needed. Took almost no time at all to swap it out.|Positive
Price was reasonable fits on cooler like a glove material looks as it will last a long time very satisfied BOB WYETT|Positive
I never felt any cool air at all Ijsust sweated six inches away with ice horrible|Negative
yeah , you need a strong breeze behind this thing|Negative
We will see what it will do in the cold weather.|Positive
Well worth the price. Plastic valves just don't do it. Thx|Positive
Fit the evaporative cooler perfectly and was easy to install.|Positive
Excellent unit. Relatively easy install but need two people to lift and hold in place. Could provide some larger and longer screws for different install locations and window configurations. Very quiet except on high speed. Also would be nice to have weather stripping included to fill in any gaps around unit. Highly recommend product and is UL Listed for safety, too.|Positive
Very reliable and usable.|Positive
Better quality than the one that originally came with our evaporative cooler|Positive
Doesn't blow air very well.Also there is no place to put the ice packs,that are included.They just float in the water.Even with the ice packs,it doesn't blow cool air.I returned it and got a industrial fan.|Negative
It didn’t meet the requirements needed to keep my apartment cool.|Negative
Performs very well in El Paso I use one in my bedroom during the night setting the timer. It cools the master bedroom very well and do not have to use main full huse evaporative cooler|Positive
Work fairly well in my small garage work shop(considering it is 110 degrees outside, Fort Worth)|Positive
In an indoor temperature of 100 degrees, the output temperature was only 89 degrees.|Negative
Husband says they fit nice and seem to be a better quality than we had previously. So, hopefully that means they will last longer. Price seemed very reasonable.|Positive
I have a very large cooler...pump keeps the pads soaking wet so wet the birds drink from it...I would recommend this to any one with a evaporating cooler...I live in the middle of the desert were the temperature average is 100 degrees or more...|Positive
This cooler makes outdoor activities much nicer during the hot Texas summer days!|Positive
Had to return the first cooler. It was broken upon opening the box. The cooler does a good job cooling. A water control valve would be useful to control the amount of cooling. Unit moves easily with wheels provided. The fan is quite noisy. For the money it is a good cooler.|Positive
Easy to install and cooled us right down. Just wish I ‘d done it sooner|Positive
This digital controller is great and it works perfectly!|Positive
My neighbor bought the traditional 4 pad cooler and I bought this one with the copper plate instead of a pad. His cost about $400 less and works much better than mine. His is at least 10 degrees cooler. Don't waste your money on this product. Buy a traditional swamp cooler. Trust me you'll be much happier.|Negative
"I bought this for friends who live in the desert, who had previously used a window air conditioner. Their home is small, so it worked well, but the electric bills were getting outrageous! According to them, a ""swamp cooler"" would be just as effective but less expensive to run. Although I can't provide specific details, I do know that they're very happy with the 2800 CFM 2-speed cooler, and I was told that installation was no problem. Incidentally, I didn't realize until I started researching these products, that it isn't at all uncommon for them to be sold without a motor, requiring you to purchase one separately. Not this one...it includes the motor!"|Positive
It's not quiet but who cares when you're nice and cool on a sweltering hot summer day!|Positive
Super heavy and durable. Fit perfect and we liked the drawstrings to hold it on. Would recommend!|Positive
Has done what I bought it for.|Positive
It is cooling very good pushes enough air to every room.|Positive
Very strong fan and it pushes out a lot of cold air. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their room nice and cool.|Positive
it leaked profusely around the bottom half gasket. we applied silicone around it and it stopped.|Negative
Easy to setup. Most effective for hot summers.|Positive
This motor is EXTREMLY NOISY, It sounds like it needs oil.... But its an enclosed unit so no oiling required.|Negative
I live in southern California's Mojave desert and the cooler keeps my upstairs between 75 and 83 degrees depending on the temperature outside and time of day. The cooler works well; has heavy duty cannisters to move around easily and can run 6-7 hours on low before needing more water. Unfortunately it is cheaply made, the water gauge seems off, it is all made of plastic, but it works great for the price.|Positive
These units work great and are much more affordable than other brands. We’re using them in a big open garage to keep work stations cool. I can walk about 20 feet away and still feel the cold air, although it feels much better if I’m standing within 10.|Positive
I love it|Positive
buckles work well ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo|Positive
The unit did NOT cool down any area!|Negative
Does what its suppose to do, Definetly cools down.|Positive
Cooled a little but not as much as I wanted. My room was just a little larger than rated so that contributed to the lack of cooling.|Negative
"I live in the Desert Southwest in Las Cruces, NM. I put the unit to test on July 3rd when the outside temp. on my patio was showing 106 degrees F with 15% humidity. I use the unit to cool my garage workshop. At the start of my test the shop temp was 97 degrees, partly due to a hot car being parked in the two car garage about an hour earlier. I removed the hot vehicle and cranked up the Hessaire unit with the garage door left open about 6"". One hour later the temp was down to 82 degrees. I measured the temp of the air coming out of the cooler to be 68 degrees. Moving 1100 cfm at that temp cooled it down quicker than I expected. After two hours the temp was down to 79 degrees. Thank you Home Depot for making this unit available."|Positive
We used our cooler all summer in our front room during the day and early evening then easily moved it to the bedroom to enjoy while sleeping. Our home is equipped with a/c however it's inefficient with the layout and wastes $ so we use only when the temp is very high(2-5 days per year). I recommend this cooler to anyone who would be using it in the proper humidity zone, check the map because if you live in a zone which is too humid this cooler will not cool your home!|Positive
This evaporative cooler cover is nice and light weight making the climb onto the roof so much easier than with my old canvis one. It fit perfectly. Of course, since I just bought it, I won't know for a while how it holds up in my windy area. I used extra 2 ropes around cooler for wind safety.|Positive
I've looked at these for years and finally decided to get one for the back porch --- We love it! Not only does it provide a cool breeze on the back porch, we've been able to open the back windows and swing the cooler around and provide a fresh cool breeze in the house.|Positive
Exactly what I needed and does the job it is made for.|Positive
did not even cool master bedroom..one minute cool air from water dripping then no water and only warm air...plenty of water in tank but just stopped cooling..water level meter worked less than half the time...would definately NOT reccommend this product|Negative
More of an expensive novelty item. Uses a water soaked filter and a small fan to cool. Does not blow cold air. Returned to store.|Negative
A little disappointed in the quality of the unit, the inlet screen does not fit very well and for a new unit it seems a little noisy, but much better than the old clunker I had on the roof before. It looks like it will be much easier to service. Not a quality issue, but the unit had a pretty good sized dent on top which I discovered after I already had it on the roof.|Negative
this cooler is a excellent buy|Positive
WOW! This is fantastic! Installation was simple, though I did have to fabricate a frame to mount into the window opening. Once set in place and connecting the water line and plugging in to an inside outlet, I was amazed at how quickly I had cool air blowing me away! Literally! Even on low speed it gets very cold super fast. It ISN'T an A/C unit to be sure, but very functional at what it does - make cool air. Kept inside temp at 72 while it was 95 outside recently. And it doesn't take a lot of space like conventional coolers do. Cool, quiet, comfortable. What more could you ask for?|Positive
It is slightly cooler but it gets the furniture wet. Better off with a good fan.|Negative
We live in the target climate for an evaporative cooler, and this cools our living room significantly. It saved us this summer.|Positive
My new Brisa evaporative cooler was easy to install, and easily cools my 1200 square foot apt. It's quiet and powerful, and inexpensive to operate.|Positive
Cools my 24 x 36 shop down about 20 degrees when it was 100+ outside w/14% humidity. It's not A/C but it makes bearable.|Positive
Installed nice|Negative
It looks like to proper one. It is my back up motor since I live 2 hour drive from a place to replace.|Positive
The surface area of the evaporative cooler is fairly small so temperature change is not great, but for a small room it works well. It seems well constructed and the remote is very nice|Positive
works well, not too loud. My warehouse is about 2,000 sq ft so not really big enough to handle this size, but I imagine it works well for smaller unit|Positive
great price|Positive
Why even manufacture a portable evaporative air cooler that doesn’t cool? I followed the instructions to a tee, ran it for a couple of days only to discover a $20 tower fan works just as well if not better because at least the air came out with so much more power. Don’t waste your money.|Negative
It was really easy to assemble but it doesn’t get as cold as it was promised. My tower fan gets colder then it does|Negative
"EXTREMELY NOISY! Adjusted belt, pullies, alignment, etc. Ran with and without belt. Nothing helped. 3 - 4 times noisier than my other motor. So bad that after 4-5 hours I took it off! I would NOT recommend purchasing this motor! If only ""zero"" 'stars' were an option!"|Negative
Just put them on. They were easy to put on haven’t had a storm yet to see if they stay on.|Positive
FIRST TIME USER AND IS DOING THE JOB PERFECT JUST WHAT I NEEDED|Positive
Easy start up.|Positive
All went very well|Positive
Very disappointed in this units performance. No matter how you adjust the waterflow the air delivered is not cooling. The air moves...it is cool only at the point of leaving the grid. Even five feet in front of the unit the air you feel...is warm. Had I not trashed the box...i would have returned it.|Negative
Fits perfectly. Keeps outdide air out. Highly recommend it to anyone.|Positive
Works exactly like we expected. Cools down our bedroom in the evenings!|Positive
The only thing that is annoying is the amount of water this takes.|Positive
great product. will last a long long time. sure beats using trash bags.|Positive
Easy to assemble, easy to use & very powerful air force. A little on the loud side, but can live with that. Keeps most of the house very cool. Replaced our swamp cooler with this cooler & wished we'd done so sooner.|Positive
This unit is big, loud, and ineffective. I'm returning it. Also, in the middle of the night, it started sounded like someone was crushing ice. I got up to see what it was and the unit was spraying water all over the place - soaked my carpet. It works no better than a good fan.|Negative
I give it a mix of 5 star and some 1 star rating. Good thing: It is large. It puts out a lot of air. This is really a garage cooler. It has good rollers and can be moved around easily. It cools 750 sq ft easily. Bad thing: It is large. And ugly. (Think of a portable dishwasher, grey). It takes some room and needs to be near a cracked window. Good thing: It is plastic, pretty light, won't rust or cut. Bad thing: It is plastic, not durable, parts don't fit together perfectly - the bottom was pushed out of shape by the weight of the water and the water ran out on the floor. Good thing: This is a real cooler, just like one you would put in a window or on the roof. It has three cooling pads. Bad thing/ Good thing It is a real cooler, just like the one you would have in the window or on the roof. So now you have that in your living room. It is very noisy. Bad things: It requires a lot of water. It uses about 1 gal per hour. That means you have to carry 24 gallons of water to it, and pour it into a little tiny opening every 24 hours of operation. It does have a hose hook up, if you are using it outside, but don't trust that in the house. It requires maintenance - If you don't want to be taking it apart with a screw driver and cleaning the pump, etc, don't get it. The pump gets clogged up - I don't remember ever having a clogged pump in a cooler before - this pump looks like something you have in a fountain rather than a cooler. The paper media has an odor and sheds into the water clogging the pump. PS - When you get it, the wheels are in a compartment with a screwed on cover , under the cooler.|Negative
it was easy to assemble but it will be not easy to take care of it because one person can not do it,so I do not like it.What else I do not like is this cooler does not have exterior and interior covers what is very necessary for of season|Negative
The imagine of how to place the wires was very small, could not really read it to well.|Positive
Relatively easy to install. No issues with performance so far. Good overall purchase.|Positive
Much better than trying to tie a rope around my cooler cover|Positive
If you have a 20 inch square vent, it should work fine. Mine is not square and is larger on 2 sides than 20 inches, so it was not a good fit and I returned it. The picture on the web site does not look square and I was hoping to replace an old metal grille that has to be taken down, stripped and repainted every year with a nice light weight poly.|Negative
Product6 was in exekent condition, well shiped and wraped. I was happy about the time of delivery and they shipped it to my home, I was not home at the time but they left it at the back of my parking stall right where it should be dropped. I am empressed on the effeciency of home depo people who I talked to on the phone when I messed up on the internet purchasing. She was nice to me and covered all the bases mto makle sure it came to my home. Thank all of you for the quick responce. Tony .|Positive
We like it , just what I was hoping for|Positive
I love that it rolls around and can fallow me around my home... My Son Call it My 747 Turbo... Works Awesome Easy to Maintain|Positive
Haven’t had it very long, time will tell regarding maintenance and durability. It does a good job cooling. I wish it were less industrial looking, and blended better with my home decor, but the cooler I had that looked nice also leaked. No leaks on this one so far.|Positive
We have been using this cooler for less then 2 months and the bottom has cracked. My husband is a professional woodworker and made a dolly to place the cooler on to give it support and to prevent this from happening. I had read from other reviewers that this could be a possibility, so we weren't going to take a chance and it still cracked. Additionally, there are only 2 speeds, which I had also known. But I wasn't prepared for how truly loud this cooler is. It is like a freight train. You can't have a conversation anywhere near it and speak at a normal volume. Perhaps this would be best served in a wear house where you don't have to speak to anyone, but then there is the cracking problem. I have called home depot and they said we could bring it back for an easy return, which we will be doing tomorrow.|Negative
Recently purchased a new Luma Comfort for my large Den. Given our Summer days in the mid- to high 90s, I've been impressed. We've also greatly valued our larger New Air, for cooling other spaces in our small, rural Home. Highly recommended Coolers. Barry Trout Lake, WA|Positive
Works real good, makes my garage three to five degrees cooler..|Positive
I bought this controller to replace another Dial controller. I was replacing because it would not keep no where near an accurate temperature. The temperature would climb if using the cooler. Bought a new one and BAM!!!..the same problem. My home cools fine but my cooler will run indefinitely with this controller. Definitely not worth the money.|Negative
Works great , just like the ones I had as a kid!!|Positive
My husband and I bought this for my mother in Tucson. It was very hot and dry there. We followed the manual step by step and it did not work at all. Four people tried and three hours later, no luck. Will try another brand.|Negative
A real cooler must blow massive amounts of air in order to cool. This cooler states it flows 2800 cfm. The way to check this is to stand in front of a 5000 cfm unit and feel the pressure. Then turn it down to half or low. It still blows very well and it could be at 1000-2000 cfm. The so called 2800 does not even come close to that. Technically this unit is a humidifier because that is all it can do. The motor and fans are under sized and in all reality will never be able to produce 2800 cfm. I have a 99 dollar 8000 BTU window AC unit in my office that blows harder and cools faster for this application. If you really want a cooler, spend another 100 bucks and get a real one. This cooler is not even worth 100 bucks since it cant even keep up with a small window AC unit. Also when the motor freezes, and it will, It would be very expensive put the money into to it to make the repair if you could buy a new motor.|Negative
Fits nicely and good quality. Has one edge that is can be opened and closed with Velcro for easy installation.|Positive
5th email about rating this product after returning it within 2 days.|Negative
Great for the area intended. Easy to operate.enjoyed the cool air without refilling the water tank for 8 hours.|Positive
Installation of the filters was easy|Positive
this is very nice cooler. It works perfectly, I do not need to have it next to a door or window. I'm glad I purchased it.|Positive
Even though after shipping it is a bit pricey. I love this thing, my husband complains that it gets to cold! My house is 1,400 sq feet and it cools every inch. I live near Phoenix AZ where its a dry and miserable heat, this machine keeps me comfortable all day and night. I havent seen the electric bill for this month, but it is supposed to be very energy efficient. It looks a little cheap because of the basic tan color choice and it sticks out pretty far from the house. We have it in a living room window and we needed to plant 3 trumpet flower bushes to cover it up. If you dont have help, Id have the driver drop it right where you plan on installing it. When the motor is on high, its a little loud but nothing that should deter you from buying this. I love it, overall one of the best purchases I ever made.|Positive
This cover has so far lasted through three winters. Cover receives about four hours daily direct sun exposure, but no rips, tears or split in any seams. Thin material, but holds up well, and I expect it will last many more years.|Positive
This cooler is all that is advertised. It is much quieter than I expected considering some other ratings. It is actually quite quiet. I have installed many over the years, this one was very easy and all parts were provided|Positive
I use it in my spare bedroom to keep my cat cool wooks great|Positive
Great for midday heat in Seattle Washington! Not so much at night|Positive
It is a little smaller than the one we had, which is good. Easy to put together, but installing it in the window was difficult. Have to take it apart to get it in and out and am not sure how to shut if down for the winter. Has kept us very comfortable on these 90degree days,running it on low.|Positive
"Received the item on time, the price was good and it fit my Mastercool 2 perfectly. Compared to the cover I was replacing, this one seems a little ""flimsy"" in regards to material quality. My previous cover was made from a pretty heavy canvas material and lasted 5 years. This one is a lot lighter and the material does not feel like a true canvas fabric. Time will tell if it lasts or not."|Positive
Exactly what I needed for my swamp cooler|Positive
Returned this product as it came damaged and it didn’t cool a small room at all.|Negative
If it is really hot it only cools the room about 10 degrees. When the temp is in the 80s it cools much better, about 20 degrees. I use it in the sunroom. You must leave the windows open. So far I must say that it does help to make the room comfortable. I also use the ceiling fan. Use ice cubes and cold water|Positive
quickly cools my 1250 sq ft house cheaply made parts weak don't know if it's worth the money yet pads are weak don't yet know if they will last the season can't recommend yet|Negative
I made the decision to install this cooler myself after several bids from contractors that I was not happy with. Free shipping was very attractive and the cooler arrived within 1 week. Home Depot and the contracted shipping company did a very good job informing me when and how the cooler would arrive. Between my online order and a couple trips to my local Home Depot store, I had all the parts required to install the cooler on my roof including ducting, vents, electrical, plumbing, and roof mounting. The cooler itself is very simple in its construction which was more attractive to me than a more full function more expensive unit. All replacement parts are available on the shelf at the store. The only negative about this cooler is the thermostat will wait up to a 4 degree difference from setpoint until it kicks from low to high. But this might be to prevent frequent switching of blower speed. Low speed is very very quiet but high speed is noisy, mostly because of the diffusers and I think any cooler would be noisy on high. Without going to a more expensive variable speed motor model, I believe that this cooler performs very well. I measured 66 deg output temp on an 85 deg day with 35% humidity outside. One other important note was that I was able to completely assemble the cooler and cart it onto my roof in parts. Overall very happy.|Positive
Easy setup, works well in direct proximity, very portable.|Positive
Thirty years of in place service. While our neighbors enjoy $400.00 electrical bills ours seldom exceeds $150.00 even during the hottest months. The water box retired after 25 years and was replaced with a Master cool unit at no great expense. Same with the motor but 25 summers in California will put a load on any unit. We stuck with the MC original equipment even though a bit pricey. We have used these units in the home, shop and office and all perform better than any in the neighborhood. TJE|Positive
"I took the wrong size should have been 65"" not 68 im sure belts are of good quality as i have purchased before"|Positive
soaked them in water the 1st day before installation to help against sagging and installed them the 2nd day. Nice smell the first few days too. still look brand new after 3 months of use. so far so good. These are the best wood style I ever used. I have used the blue Synthetic Pads mostly.|Positive
The product is good but when we removed it from the box to put it on the roof, it had several dents in it.|Positive
Purchased a month ago and cooler exceeded our expectations. First, unpacking was a easy. Unit came assembled with the exception of the wheels, which are in a compartment on the bottom of the unit (FYI). We use this daily on our back patio to help beat the Phoenix heat. It’s awesome!!|Positive
Did not cool, had to return it, tried ice cubes and ice packs|Negative
was a gift says works good|Positive
A great deal for a good part. Helpful staff makes for a great experience.|Positive
excellent product|Positive
the fan is a little weak to drive the cooler in a small living room. More of personal cool.|Positive
Fit perfectly and is easily folded for storage.|Positive
This product keeps you cool as long as you sit directly in front of it. Do not buy if your intention is to use it as an alternative to air conditioning. It does not keep an area cool so much as it keeps air flowing throughout the area. It is definitely not meant to run as often as an air conditioner. It is high maintenance, and mine is now broken from normal daily use after 1 month. Not worth the money.|Negative
Works good as expected, good quality, worth the money.|Positive
This switch is easy to wire and to use. Problem is...it only lasted 2 years before it failed. First, the high speed setting stopped working. Eventually, you couldn't get it to turn off.|Negative
"I've never had a water cooled cooler before. If I remember correctly, we purchased the mid-sized unit (seems like there was a smaller and larger one) Usually, my philosophy is ""bigger is better"". But, due to space constraints (this is still a pretty big unit) and cost of the unknown, I scaled back some on this purchase. Since it did't have a compressor, honestly, I wasn't sure what to think. The biggest adjustment I had to make to my expectation was that it didn't cool an area. It isn't made to cool rooms, etc. This unit operates like a misting fan. It is just self-contained. Keep in mind, if you aren't in front of it, you're not going to get much benefit from it. That being said however, we did take it to the hottest football game tailgate we have ever attended. And people were coming from neighboring tents to cool down. This thing was a lifesaver! We went through about 32 gallons of water in 6 hours, but it seemed to keep up. For the price, no complaints here! The only other thing that I noticed was that the first few uses generated a pretty foul fishy smell. No clue of why that was since we used distilled water out of the gate. Still, my wife is into the whole essential oil thing, so a few drops later and the entire tent smelled of lemongrass. Ha. Good times!"|Positive
"It works, just as advertised, and was very easy to set up. No ""installation"" is necessary, and no exhaust hose to the outside is necessary. The only quibble: the water tray's ""maximum"" level is not visible while the tray is being filled; it's only visible from the front of the cooler."|Positive
This product is great. It was made with me in mind because I do not like to bring unattractive appliances into my home and this unit fits just fine into any room I place it in. I love the safety features and many modes/speeds it offers. The palm tree setting makes me feel like I am really catching a breeze from the tropics. I will recommend this product to my friends because it has allowed me to have a cooled home and is saving energy all at the same time.|Positive
They are much thicker the the ones you get in stores|Positive
The fan blows strong, however, needs ice in order for the air to be cool.|Negative
After a few months the motor is already making noise. It's still running but not sure for how long. Thinking of returning the motor before the warranty runs out.|Negative
We bought this unit 2 years ago and the pump is already gone. I have looked for a replacement pump but no luck. So there is $500 gone and only got 2 years out of this unit. Luckily we had it covered but we are getting a discounted amount back|Negative
We are using this evaporative fan on our boat and it works very well. it takes up very little room and when you put ice cubes in the reservoir it cools very nicely.|Positive
Looked good and fan worked, but pump did not work.|Negative
For it's original purpose, I have no comment as I was trying to repurpose it for rural cooling. The problem I had with it is that it sheds fone pieces like a piece of Shredded Wheat!|Negative
Stays nice and cold , but only downfall is you need to put it by a window , the whole purpose of me getting this one instead of an ac unit , is because I cannot access my window in the room|Negative
The product was fine, but the box was busted and falling apart when it was delivered. The little clips and washer things were not secured inside of a bag so they were just all over and fell out of the broken box. Fortunately I had enough to still attach the pads just fine, but what a mess.|Negative
I love this thing! You have to remember that it is an evaporative cooler and not an AC unit. This cooler puts out an abundance of air even on the low setting and will blow itself across the room if you have tile or hardwood floors on high. I found that out just the other day. I hope my luck with this product continues. I would highly recommend this.|Positive
I like the ease of installation.|Positive
The price for this motor was very good, and the fact that it was in stock was wonderful. The only low point with this motor is that it is quite a bit noisier than the original. Not bearing noise, but 60 Hz hum the original did not have. It works great, and since it's not right in my ear, I can overlook the hummmmmm. A reasonable purchase.|Positive
Good for desktop -- cools area quickly, but the larger the area, the poorer the cool. Water must be added after 3-4 hours. It is overpriced-- One should be able to find another for about half this price. Delivery time was correct, about 7-10 days|Negative
It has been running great, no problems in performance. And all for a great price.|Positive
Whew. I was afraid I’d have to replace the whole cooler. This installed easily and works great!|Positive
I'd buy them again too, I recommend them. They work, it's heavy canvas, with a drawstring, they smell of a chemical used to treat the canvas to weatherproof them I suppose, but if you don't crawl up on your roof sniffing them real often, you'll not notice it except when installing them, must easier than plastic garbage bags... I suppose you could use a garbage bag under and/or over them too if you want to. It is easiest if before getting on the roof draw the drawstring up tight, you can loosen it if you need to on the roof, but the first time you try tightening them, the canvas is pretty stiff, so draw them up before climbing the ladder, you'll see what I mean, it saves time. Good product so far.|Positive
simple and easy to install|Positive
This fan is a nice addition to our patio. It's quiet and the features come in handy. We bought a cover for ours to keep pests out.|Positive
I returned it. It did not cool more that 2 inches. My mobile home is 400 sq feet. It should have cooled the whole place. It did not.|Negative
This might work in a patio or porch but is terrible for indoors. Even with a window open and ice in it as recommended it barely pushed any cool air. I would say that a high quality fan would work better. Another problem with it was that there is no way to turn off the humidity so it is also making the room humid while barely cooling it. I had to return it.|Negative
Great product slot more reliable than old one|Positive
Easy to install. Seems to be doing the trick.|Positive
Tank holds a lot of water, but it also puts a lot of humidity into the air. Louvers rattle. Fan is loud. Returned this product.|Negative
made my swamp cooler run quieter and smooth and when I needed the part it was in stock thanks homedepot|Positive
Works great but kind of loud. We use it all over and can still watch TV but have to turn it up a bit louder. It has 3 speeds not 2 and you can use just the fan without the pump on and that cools off to. If we have it in the livingroom it does use more water but if we have it in the bedroom it's smaller and doesn't require as much. We have a nice size bedroom not huge and it works great but you do feel a bit damp.|Positive
23 Aug: 2016: Tuesday: Hello Folks: This 4000 CFM Champion swamp cooler is perfect to cool my home!!!! The free shipping to store also was a selling point. My last Champion swamp cooler lasted me about 7+ years. So I told myself to go with Champion again. Thank you all @ Home Depot for excellent service. Also folks, purchase the black tar for coating the bottom pan!!! I believe my last unit lasted so long, was because I coated the pan every year with black tar to prevent rust. Our water here in Calif. is very hard on steel. The black tar comes in one qt cans & is a blue & white colored container. It is manufactured by {{{{ Dial }}}} out of Arizona. It takes about 25 minutes to coat the bottom pan. A one qt can will sell for about $5.00+/-. Buy a 3 inch wide paint brush to do the job. Best/Wishes Charles..|Positive
This cooler is working terrific for me. I don't like air conditioning, it dries me out and makes me sick. This evap cooler works similar to a portable heater. I set it near me and it blows cool (NOT ice cold) air on me and keeps me comfortable in my 85 - 90 degree house. It doesn't cool down a room like an air conditioner would, but it tempers the heat and makes working at home comfortable. Fans blow around hot air, this blows cool air. It rolls around pretty easily, even when full of water. I don't mind the moisture it adds to the air, but some may not like that. For me, it helps my sinuses. I'm in San Diego and it's been 60 percent humidity and the cooler has still been effective, only raising the humidity level about 5 percent in the room. I've had it for two weeks now, and no problems so far. I use it my sun porch, as stated, near an open window, with an exterior door open for exhaust path. The fan is pretty strong, but not unpleasantly loud. I've actually been running in on low and it's enough. I do like the sound of the water running over the pad, to me it sounds like a water fountain, peaceful. If you want a portable cooler, this is great. But it is NOT an air conditioner that will cool down a room 10 or 20 degrees.|Positive
I recommend this product as it was easy to install, well made and provides excellent protection.|Positive
Fits our Bonaire Durango model. Works fine.|Positive
Draw string on the bottom is hard to tighten and leave residew on your hands. Needs middle strap to take up extra material. Great quality material.|Positive
Frigidaire evaporated cooler is easy to use! I used it in the kitchen and the cool air blast into the room. All I have to do is add water on the top of the unit. I opened the flap and pour the water into the container. It goes straight into a bin at the bottom where cooler shows me the minimum and maximum level. Then I turn on the cooler and that’s it! It works fast! There are different settings on how cool I want the room. I can have the fan and the cooler running at the same time! It is a quiet and portable machine. The cooler has wheels at the bottom for me to move the machine from room to room. I love it! A great alternative to AC! A must buy!|Positive
The finish had some sharp edges all over since the casting was not cleaned up but the pulley functions.|Positive
This large evaporative cooler is wonderful. It is easily moved, even when full, with the solid rubber casters provided. Puts out a huge powerful force of air....feels like wind, really! I think 3 of these will cool my 9,000sf barn easily.|Positive
Packaging was easy to remove and installation was simple and quick. Been running smoothly doing a great job since installed.|Positive
This fan works well for me. I put ice in the water tank along with the freezer packs that is included for extra cooling. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and haven't had any problems. It operates as designed, and as expected.|Positive
The first problem is the water pan. It does not come out for cleaning and re-filling. In addition, the compartment for the ice-pack is not easily found. The air output is not as cool as it could be. However, it is much better than a fan, since it cools the room more effectively than a fan does.|Negative
it came with a big dent in the top i didn’t see it until I opened it. It was more work to take it back than it was to take a hammer to it.|Negative
it was obviously a return or floor model and should have been labeled that way. it still had water in it, the pack material was just shoved in the box. now it makes noise and sprays water at full speed. i don't know if it was put together wrong or is missing something.|Negative
Came out of the box all ready. Nothing additional to buy. Works great!|Positive
The unit is what I expected. The only issue I have is to install the optional motor. I have to buy a extra keeper collar and modify the fan pulley to line up with the motor pulley. You might have thought it would be plug and play.|Positive
Just like what came with it , but better. The main pad is one piece instead of two like the originals.|Positive
Easy to use and assemble. Cools very efficiently|Positive
This is my third pump. The first one lasted about two years. The second about two months. I need now a third one. My only advice: DO NOT go 220V. Pumps and motors are too cheaply built. When you get in to industrial it gets too loud. Don't waste your money.|Negative
This is a great cooler. Quiet and efficient. I got the RWC35. The only thing to know--before you buy--is that this is a remote and therefore a timer, like one used on lights, will NOT work. A timer will work on manual units. I bought this unit and brought it to my remote location only to find out after a lot of research that the remote control units aren't turned on by a electric timer. BUT it will turn the cooler off! Wish the company would put this out there in literature as a consumer it seems like the right thing to do.|Positive
My rooftop swampcooler needs work I can't afford so I purchased this free standing model in lieu of repairs. I think it works well as long as I turn it on before the day gets to hot. Unlike air conditioning, this cooler requires that the window are open to get a cross breeze...otherwise my house just gets hot and humid. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it|Positive
An ordinary fan cooled the room better than this product. I have been trying to return it. Guess i will have to make the two hour drive to do so. It is not easy to return an online purchase.|Negative
Rigid Cooler pads fit perfectly easy to install no problem at all thank you.|Positive
Great value for the price. The pads were easy to install and fit very well. I would have given it five stars if it were not for a shortage of mounting clips, only six supplied, not enough for a secure mount. Also these pads don't seem to cool quite as well as the originals.|Positive
Highly recommend this unit to everyone.Buy it you will glad you did.|Positive
Belt is making noise after one week! Even after adjusting tension.|Negative
Unit did not work and it was returned. The fan was weaker that any I have bough in the past. It did not cool any area.|Negative
Good purchase|Positive
Worked great.|Positive
I bought this unit at Home Depot Antelope and did the installation myself. My house is 1600 sqft. but in a matter of 5-10 minutes it cools down. I drilled a 3/8 hole to drain the basin's remnant water and plugged it with a rubber stopper. I'm less worried now for my electric bill this summer.|Positive
Doesn’t really do much to keepCool would not recommend or purchase again definitely did not meet my expectations|Negative
Liked it so much-bought three. use them to keep the pets cool outside and one for the garage|Positive
Works ok|Positive
Precisely what I want.|Positive
Definitely assists in cooling the area.|Positive
Unfortunate mistake. Due to money reasons, I had to buy this. This cooler is a joke. It's noisy. The vents don't close to keep air out. There is no internal Grille cover for it. I called the company. Although HD sells one that's supposed to be for it, it's not. I will be returning the cover, and figure out how to cover the vents when needed. Right now I have two pillows in it. But you have to remove the Grille to put them in. Not convenient.|Negative
Installed easily and operates well.|Positive
I wanted to reduce my electric bill during the summer here in Phoenix and, with the very dry climate here, I thought that the best thing would be to get a swamp cooler. However, there is no way to install one in this rented unit so I thought the next best thing would be a portable high quality powerful one. This did the trick. I have a patio door that I open (it has a locked metal screen) and I place the unit there and it works great. Sure, in August it will be too humid to be efficient and I will use the central air, but for now the other 4 months of the summer it works great and has greatly reduced my electric cost. The best situation is the one I have -- a patio door. Having just a window I do not think would work. Good luck!|Positive
Great price and very satisfied with online customer service.|Positive
Easy to install and works great|Positive
I'm using one of these in my shipping container shop... really works well! I use it from the side door flowing air to the end doors and it is a really nice little addition to the shop. Casters work well and it even looks pretty cool too ( I got the red color) Oscillating function makes for nice distribution of air flow too. Will even be trying this out in my greenhouse later to see if I can extend it's usage into the warmer months:)|Positive
just blew hot air|Negative
great cooler for the space, would like to have a timer but can manage|Positive
The pump was easy to install and brought life back to our swamp cooler.|Positive
This unit is extremely loud and doesn't do a good job cooling my small 500sq ft apt down. It was only 80 deg outside and it couldn't get the job done. I'm not sure how it got so many good reviews other than the company paying people to leave good reviews. Home Depot let me return it without a problem but I just wasted the time it takes to go pick it up and then go back and wait in line to return it.|Negative
Pretty flimsy|Negative
This evaporative cooler delivers on its promise to provide cool air over a fairly large interior area. Only one problem: the water level indicator sometimes sticks. This resulted in our overfilling the water tank to the point that an overflow occurred, spilling water onto our hardwood floor. Also, taking the device apart for cleaning is a bit cumbersome. Portability is a big plus.|Positive
the cover is thinner than other covers I have had and generously cut beyond size so it fits looser. I will look for something else likely next year.|Negative
This is the best thing I have ever ordered. I saw it in the owners manual of my new cooler and ordered it. With my old cooler I covered the inside with a piece of foam rubber and held it in place with a large elastic band. This is so cool, it slips right on and I can stand in front of it and not have cold air come in through it.|Positive
"To be honest I tried harder to like it because I wanted to avoid repacking and return process but had to. I bought it for my garage and water consumed in 3 hours still I wasn't feeling any difference between regular fan and this evaporative fan. To me it wasn't worth it spending this much money to feel no difference in air quality or feel just a little equal to none. Air blast speed is not sufficient either, the max felt like at slow. So I returned it in 3 weeks. Even with water it wasn't cooling enough to make say "" Wow""."|Negative
I am really impressed with this portable evaporative cooler. It is very easy to setup and does a great job cooling my office space, and bedroom. It comes with 2 ice packs for more cooling power, but they aren't required. I have found that the water bin does stick when I try to pull it out, and the handle isn't big enough to grasp, which makes it harder to remove. I think with an actual handle, it would be much better. However, this doesn't affect the quality of the cool air it is dispensing. I have a laser temperature gauge, and I used it to see the temp of the air coming from this cooler vs the home a/c. I was more than surprised to see that it was blowing a comfortable 77* while my house a/c was set at 74* I will say that I experimented by filling the water bin with half water and half ice (unsure if this voids warranty, but it works) and the air was significantly cooler than it was with even the ice packs. I love how easy it is to move from room to room, and the size of the fan itself. Overall I am very ipressed with this item, and would definitely purchase a second!|Positive
This unit was great when I first hooked it up but within the last two weeks or so it stopped working but I just found out as I was cleaning my swamp cooler getting it ready for winter shut down. The only reason I bought this stupid thing was because of the test button. However with this kind of last-ability I will go back to using the cheaper models without the test button. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|Negative
Pump is well built, was easy to install, and moves more water up into the system than did my old conventional pump thus allowing the cooler to work more efficiently (colder air now blows through vents).|Positive
Missing parts, Unit did not have a drain plug. Called bonaire just answering machine, left message, No response. home depot does not want it back. If not for Tractor Supply having parts to fix it, the thing would just be a $700 dollar paper weight. Put water in it seems to blow.....|Negative
Nice cover ,I like the velcro on the open side, seals up nicely .|Positive
When you need it, nothing else will do. Old unit froze up with corrosion; this one should last at least through its one-year warranty.|Positive
Does what it is supposed to do for the most part. Bought this to replace a older one. Could be better , when closed is not a great seal wind still blows air through.|Positive
This has worked out great for my cooler, so happy to find quality product at a great price!|Positive
Bought this to cool my office at the end of our home which the central air conditioner doesn't cool enough. Performs beyond my expectations. Not only will it cool my office but many times now I use it in our family room and can save turning on the ac. This will cool any space you have if not very hot. Have run it all night in our BR and no issues. The only thing is you have to remember to keep filling the reservoir. Do not hesitate in buying one, they are great!!! Thanks Home Depot.|Positive
Got this for my grand daughters apartment bedroom. Thee appartment is a 2 bedroom 2 bath & kitchen. The bedrooms are pretty good size, not huge but not small by any means. Theres 1 A/C unit in the livingroom, kinda like a motel would have near the floor and blows straight down the hallway to one bedroom but thee other bedroom is off set so doesn't really get cool. So to save on electricity we got this water cooler in that room and it really does help to cool it down. Its not cold in there but theres no sweating any more or tossing and turning all night. We live in SoCal so we do get a little occasional humidity so on those nights/days its not the greatest but still it helps beat the heat! Oh and it is a good looking cooler, space saver and has a low water level warning beep also. Do try one, you'll like it!|Positive
It took a little more time to install than they thought, even with the combined efforts of my husband and son and son-in-laws, but it works well now, aside from being a little noisy.|Positive
This unit works great, installation was fairly straight forward, looks much better than a traditional unit, and it cools our house very well. Haven't had any issues with leaking unless the two bottom screws that hold the pad cover in place are not installed. I installed a normal pump, for about twenty $ for the purge and love that option, it keeps the water fresh and clean. The purge pump option from champion is a little to spendy IMHO but it does come with a bracket to hold the pump in place, but that's not really needed. Fan is a little lound, but no worse than a box fan so not an issue for us. Just a tip, check your local hardware stores as I got mine from ace for about 15% less than HD. Also, I wouldn't recommend leaving the auto siphon hose in the drain, it wastes a lot of water, just set it in the tank or take the tee out and run some new tubing, not very much $, and install the purge pump.|Positive
Pump fit perfectly, very easy to install and works properly. Cooler works like it did new.|Positive
I bought this product for a sun porch in Tampa Bay area and returned it within several days. This product did not cool the area as expected and in fact it could have added heat through the humidity but I think it could work well in a southwestern US climate.|Negative
But don't expect wonders. Bought a used return from the store. It cools the air by a few degrees with a waterfall effect behind the fan. Unfortunately, for our situation, that is insufficient. Just get a good fan instead.|Negative
Not very good-keeps turning off after awhile. House is under 1000. sq ft and does not seem to cool house. Looked up on site what size of cooler to buy and took the suggestion. Not satisfied. I had it professionally installed.|Negative
seams are not great, had to duct tape one side. but for the cost worked GREAT!! the dial adjustments are hard to read I had to listen for the pump to come on to tell for sure the setting. owned for 2 months. happy with it. I wish the louvers would turn sideways, they only adjust up and down. in the center.|Positive
Awesome cooler. Arizona is hot from April - November. Home is kept so cool that I need to wear long sleeves during the summer.|Positive
I run double aspen pads on my cooler and this pump provides the correct water flow for them.|Positive
It meets all expectations. Fits nicely.|Positive
This is the first time I have written a product review. This fan is fantastic. I am very pleased with my purchase. With no a/c and record breaking temperatures, this fan has allowed me to keep my cool. If you are considering this purchase, do it. It does a wonderful job.|Positive
These have too short of a lifespan and better options would be great|Negative
The product was a perfect fit and came in right on time , witch made the customer happy and Mr Electric.|Positive
I replaced an old pump for this one which had the same rating and found that it works much better than the old one, is much quieter and super easy to install, this is the best at this rating.|Positive
Great Product ; 10 minutes setup , 48 Hours free shipping from CA. to UT. , Digital read out display for the timer and current temp . This is it . Thanks Air'n'Water.|Positive
Great product, ended taking back because it didn’t work for my specific context, but nice product.|Positive
Although I bought this product some weeks ago, I finally hooked it up and filled the tank yesterday, June 21. I got this machine for my wife, and she did use it last night from approximately 2:00 am to 6:00 am. She said even at low speed it did provide sufficient cooling but did admit that she'll have to get used to the noisel Thus far it seems that we have a keeper!|Positive
Perfect fit, generally these will last 5-6 seasons.|Positive
Excellent Product. Moves air very well. Cooled the porch down by at least 10 degrees.|Positive
Metal is always the first to go with these.. first rust and corrosion, then the motor bushings. This one looks to be more protected than my last one of the same brand. More importantly, and as others have said.. the more water on the pads the better.. so open up your water passages and let it do it's job :) Working very well so far.|Positive
This is the 3rd one I've had, last one lasted less than a year. Unfortunately there isn't an alternative that I've found. Temperature response is terrible since it generates heat which fools it to keep the cooler running after the house as cooled down.|Negative
After hearing great things about this unit I purchased one. I left it on for about 2-3 hours, then I noticed a damp musty smell in the room. Also it wasn't cooling the room fast enough. You need to add water to it, but maybe you need to add ice water to get it to blow out cold air. The smell in the room was enough for me to return it. I bought a GE window air conditioning unit instead which worked out great!|Negative
Great product but I'm weird about holes need to create clamp to window frame like I did... no holes unit works great, I personally put a set of vice grips on black tube... wasting water is not good wasting water and touch screen is the death of human race... how many a diggers touch that auto soda machine at wendys.|Negative
"I bought a AF-310 in May 28th of this year. By July 20th of this year (2018) it started leaking out of the bottom. I contacted NEWAir support and was told it was covered under warranty. Great I thought. Oh but wait you have to pay them to ship you a replacement unit really your website says on your home page ""ALWAYS FREE SHIPPING"" i paid it waited 8 days no replacement unit no tracking info NOTHING but you surly took my money. Then I call again to find out that Customer support failed to note that is was a cross ship item. So yet again I continue to wait for my replacement unit. BAM second shipping charge to my CC. I call and ask to speak to Customer service manager who then tells me I am wrong and my bank is wrong. But yet I can see it in black and white. I ask to speak to someone from Corporate office and I am told sorry I can't do that I can't give you any of that information. So I get doubled charged for replacement shipping and still not replacement unit. I wonder how this company has stayed in business. I will never buy another unit or anything this company makes. They will not back up their products they are not Customer friendly. The units won't even last 60 days. I am sorry but maybe you should go back to design team and tell them to fix the issue. Then fire you whole customer service staff cause they fail to understand the first word in their titles are Customer (means to help the people that buy your products) not treat them like they are lairs and take their money with nothing in return. If I could go back in time I would NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT. TOTAL JUNK!"|Negative
Effectiveness will vary with your humidity level, but in the Desert it is working great. One Caveat is the float for the built-in water supply; it's set so that the water fills to the middle of the tank (and not the top), which means that you will get the sound of dripping water when using the supply hose. I push the float down with a rod so that the tank fills up all the way - no drip when the tank is full. I would rate it one star lower for this, but most portable evap coolers don't even come with a water supply attachment, so it wouldn't be justified. The float is specially designed and doesn't look like it can be adjusted. I'm guessing this was an engineering decision to make sure that there's no chance of tank overflow when using the garden-hose connector. For the money it's a good value. If it's really drawing only 0.7 amps, then it's by far the cheapest way to cool a small room.|Positive
easy to install and I liked the extra ice packs. I will tell friends|Positive
It turned out perfect. I just slipped it in there, hooked it up and all went well|Positive
I ordered this online for pickup at my local store. I had the same model on my Phoenix house for 18 years before the cabinet rusted through and needed replacement, so this one was easy to just put up in its place. The pads last for years at a shot, so you eventually save money over Aspen pad models. The sections (wet section and blower cabinet) are able to be separated for ease of transport and I was able to get the entire thing in the back of my SUV. All in all a very high quality unit.|Positive
The shipping was fast and it looked great but with ice and water I could not get more than four or 5° delta which is the difference between incoming air and I'll coming air. Even at a lower fan speed. Wouldn't recommend it|Negative
THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK TO COOL DOWN ANYTHING IT SUX WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY IT BLOWS AIR OUT ABOUT 78 DEGREES WITH ICE IN THE BIN AND DOES NOT COOL IT JUST BLOWS SORRY AIR DONT BUY THESE STAND UP UNITS BUY WINDOW MOUNT ONLY IF U NEED TO COOL A ROOM|Negative
This item works great for our 700sf room.|Positive
Cheap and well made, I have several of these and they have saved a ton of scratches on both stock and custom helmets. And they don't cost a fortune, like the others.|Positive
Cheap flimsy plastic. Save your money and get the better metal one. To bulky. Only bought it to get mr by.|Negative
I've been using Swamp Coolers for about 10 years. And I live in a dry hot air (Las Vegas). They're awesome and they've saved me hundreds on my electric bill. This one cools really well HOWEVER, the indicator that tells you whether or not you've filled it with water? One of the cheapest engineering designs I've ever seen. The bob in the tank rises up and pushes this little piece of plastic up. The piece of plastic sticks and doesn't move half the time.. you reach in to pull the bob up to get it unstuck and then plastic piece comes unloose and drops to the bottom of the tank. It's just useless. You might as well just eyeball it. I recommend the product (does cool off a room) but it's a little pricey for this kind of cheapness in the design. (I mean it can tell if the water level is low and turn off the motor but you can't put an indicator in for the amount of water in it???)|Negative
The motor overheated and died after 2 summers. Lowest priced but also lowest quality.|Negative
"Only 1/2"" thich...quickly wore out...needed a 5/8"" belt...but this works well in a pinch..."|Positive
Not what I expected. Air (average, not cold) comes out through a narrow window on the front and the ice pack does not enhance the quality of the air (fresher). They say there is a 'chamber' to place the ice pack, but even though I talked to a representative to find out how, she could not tell me about that chamber and the thing is that the ice pack remains loose in the water.|Negative
Canvas shroud fit perfectly and looks durable. Expecting to get several seasons out of it.|Positive
Product is alright. But I had a unit that was just a 1/3 of the cost and it did a better job cooling off my garage here in vegas. Giving this one a few more days and if I dont see a difference I will be returning it.|Negative
Buy the one made for your swamp cooler this one doesn't have the same media at the top where the h2o enters and spreads across the full screen.|Negative
I live in Phoenix, AZ and this cooler has been awesome. Highly recommend this cooler if you live where it is not humid.|Positive
This product is nothing more than hay in a bag.|Negative
When our old canvas cover wore out I tried to find another canvas cover and could not, so I got a thinner material, which promptly blew away during the first winter storm. I found this one this year and it is similar to what we had before. It is heavy and stayed secure during the high winds we have had. We also put a large bungee cord around the middle of it to help keep it in place. The old one lasted many years, so I expect that this one will too.|Positive
Good and nice and cool|Positive
This is a great addition to any home with or without central cooling. Our home is equipped with a central cooling; however our patio area isn't where we entertain family and friends. the 250 CFM 3 Speed Tower is our answer to the summer cool down.|Positive
The Hessaire 5,300 CFM 3-Speed Portable Evaporative Cooler (Swamp Cooler) for 1,600 sq. ft., Gray works great in my large living room with vaulted ceiling. I just run it real quick and point it at the ceiling after work so it's not radiating heat from the day into the room.|Positive
Needed to replace my cooler motor. Old one said it was 1 1/2 HP, when I went to store they helped me select a lower HP and cost motor that was a replacement for the old motor. The 3/4 HP has been keeping our home cool even on the lower speed. Very happy with the product and help I received from the Home Depot staff.|Positive
Does what I want it to do, works great in my enclosed patio.|Positive
This was worth every penny and more ! It keeps out the noise and air what an ingenious idea.|Positive
One of the best products that I have purchased in a long while. Works better than expected. It's been running around 100+ degrees here lately and this product has allowed us to spend time in our outdoor kitchen area in comfort. It really is a wonderful product.|Positive
Cooler is very poorly made and you better coat the bottom before you use it because in the first season the paint was gone on the bottom.very upsetting|Negative
Saving so much money on a/c! Will recommend to everyone I know here in Arizona.|Positive
Works great for our patio space|Positive
I have a well and the water is slightly acidic. It will eat through brass ends of hoses and the brass arm of the cooler floats. I always keep a spare so that I don't have to run to the store to replace the float. About a month ago, in the midst of July 100+ heat wave, the arm rotted through and the water was running into and out of the water pan wasting water like mad. I grabbed the spare I had and easily replaced it. House got a little hotter because I turned the cooler off during replacement, but it wasn't off for the trip to the store and the replacement time.|Positive
Very sturdy unlike the esick air unit this one replaced. moves a lot of cool air , very happy with unit|Positive
Cover fit good. Good material for the price.|Positive
THE MEDIA PAD SET UNFORTUNATELY WAS THE WRONG SIZE. I HAVE ALREADY RETURNED IT TO HOME STORE IN LA QUINTA,CA.|Positive
I ordered the Master cool 5000 CFM side draft cooler for my three car garage in southern AZ. I ordered the cooler online with Home Depot and picked it up in the store. I received a notice the next day the cooler was ready for pick-up. Cooler was received in good condition. I now have it installed and working with no issues. The cooler does as I expected and works great to cool the garage.|Positive
I was replacing my Dial controller and the change over went smoothly|Positive
Returned to store because of excess noise.|Negative
It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but it really does do the trick. I love the quality of this cover. That alone makes this purchase well worth it.|Positive
"This cooler works great in the dry climate! We just bought this unit 07-18-10. We live in a 35 ft class A motorhome. The square footage is 352. We wanted to stay cool and be economical. Using the motorhome's air conditioners was not an option due to the costs of running them while plugged into my sisters house. They use at least 24 AMPS. This unit pulls about 5.5 AMPS which is going to be very cheap to run. We have it on a stand on the outside of the drivers window. Cut cardboard to fill the hole. We use a fan on the seat to blow the air back to the kitchen in the coach and then another fan in the kitchen to blow it back all the way to the bedroom. ( leaving bedroom window open 3 inches) Evaporative coolers need to have the air directed so the air can flow. A good rule of thumb is to turn the ""PUMP ONLY"" on for a good 20 minutes before you start to use it each time so that the pads get good and soaked."|Positive
I have not used it for very long to tell how well it works. Replacing old calcified honey comb filter improved the cooling and stress on the fan motor tremendously. They need to provide one more wider sheet of Styrofoam. It took me two sheets on each side wall to cover the gap. I used one of the old sheets for that.|Positive
worked great. easy to put on.|Positive
I purchased this for my bedroom only. I just moved to HI and found out that I do not have AC in my apt. That's ok because I am never there anyway. So, this product is used at night. I like it, it's quiet but sure does collect the algae so to speak... Have to make sure you clean the water bucket type thingie... Also, maybe someone can answer me on this, it's making a gurgling sound even when the water is full, filter is clean and so forth. I thought It may have been dirty but wasn't... It comes and goes.. Other than that, I am happy with it for the most part...Just trying to figure out that noise...|Positive
The water pump broke down after 3 days of operation, Dont take a chance.....Buy American!|Negative
It's a float valve! It shuts off the water line I piped to my console humidifier so I don't have to add water to it with a bucket every day in the heating season. Works well and consistently so over all I'm happy with it. As far as reliability or longevity I can't comment yet. It seems solid though.|Positive
Great unit, keeps my house cooled off, Kitchen, Living Room and Bed Room if I keep the door open. It uses a good amount of water if on High, but no so much on Low speed. Live in the AZ desert and it has made my days cooler.|Positive
worked well|Positive
good quality. great price.|Positive
This is no A/C, but as a swamp cooler, it does a great job. I live in Phoenix and daytime high is in the 110s. I have this unit on my porch and with this blowing in my face I can sit outside and watch the world cup. The low setting is still too strong for my taste. The mid/high is bit loud. Those are the only cons.|Positive
Fit like a glove... that's the second one. The last one made it 15 years! It out lasted the cooler!|Positive
This Portacool evaporative cooler is an excellent addition to an outdoor patio, or in a workshop if you can get past the quality control issues. I bought mine about three weeks ago for a patio party. The unit came out of the box covered in mud spots, and had dirt in the water tank. The hose connection was loose and had to be tightened. The water tank leaked when the pump was running due to a hole drilled through the water tank at the factory. Once I performed the necessary cleaning, flushing, connection tightening, and hole sealing, I set the unit up to run. As the instructions state, it must be level. It pushes a good volume of air, and cools the air. On the day of the party, the ambient air temp was 96 degrees, and air coming out of the cooler was 75 degrees. It's easy to roll around on the big casters. It's an outdoor unit, so it sounds like a big box fan. The drain is large, and allows the water tank to drain quickly. With a hose connection, the water level is self-regulating. The tank will hold about 8 gallons, which allows for several hours of use. For what it does, I recommend it, but be prepared for some quality control issues.|Negative
These covers are very well made and last for 5 years or more. My last one I had for 15 years. Plus, they have the greatest inventory of sizes and shapes. I will buy again.|Positive
I work as a service advisor in a dealership. They do not offer climate control so I purchased this product to help with handling a hot summer day in July in Texas. This fan makes the heat more tolerable. I don't think I could make it through the shift with out a portacool. Highly recommended.|Positive
excellent product and as always fast delivery.|Positive
Very pleased with the amount of air this unit moves. I've owned a comparable portacool unit in the past. I think this unit is better. I think the large amount of surface area for the media helps it perform better. I'm using it in a 2400 square foot warehouse with 100 degree plus weather for perspective.|Positive
Would buy it any other day, great material, good servicemen|Positive
It's terrible – – keeps coming off. The ties inadequately tighten the cover. I even tied it around the waterline, but during a breezy day, it came off -- would've lost it. I even put duct tape on the inside to adhere to the unit, but it still got blown off. Ordered another cover – – different brand.|Negative
Works great and its not very heavy only took two people to install.|Positive
The straps have stayed on through very windy weather. I would recommend them.|Positive
Definitely a plug and play item that is easy to install. The increased water flow greatly improved the amount of cold air.|Positive
Good product at a great price!|Positive
It would have been really useful if it had a something for the screw to go into. We tried to use a washer but the washer ended up not being strong enough. It’s a cool concept but in the end we had to just use a hammer and knock the wheel down and then clean off the pole and pull it off ourselves.|Negative
So far so good. Top fan setting fan makes noise|Positive
Good quallity fit perfect very satisfied|Positive
Worked fine. Turns on and cuts off water precisely.|Positive
I had to return this because the water trickling noise was too loud. also it really did not cool down the room as much.|Negative
Works great! Only took about 10 minutes to put the castors on, hook up hose, and ready to go. Puts out good supply of air and is fairly quite. Will have to see how it works in my garage in July here in Arizona. That will be the test!|Positive
I have a large evaporative cooler and this cover worked well. The corners didn't fit exactly but my evap is old and is probably a slightly different size than the newer models. The material it is made of seems strong and I was able to secure it well with the tie downs I bought separately.|Positive
easy to install and keeps the house cool as we need it|Positive
I found that the cooling effect was very limited during the first 3 weeks. Now there is now cooling effect except for the fan. For some reason the water is not being pumped into the evaporation media. This is a fail. I need to have this failure repaired.How do I gat it repaired?|Negative
The cover is made well. Unfortunately it is a bit difficult to install because the are no holes in the cover to attach the chains that hang the cooler in place. The canvas appears to be strong enough to last for a number of years..|Positive
Easy fit and work.|Positive
Drops the temp. 20 to 25 degrees on dry days. Great for my 700 square foot house in zone 3 I think it was.|Positive
Easy to install, make sure it is on square as the cover and cooler are rectangular. Also, get the straps.|Positive
This cooler does help keep inside temps bearable,at a fraction of the cost. I was a bit disappointed with the Chinese craftsmanship....not the highest quality. You get what you pay for.|Negative
works good for me out in the Mohave desert trying to cool 1100 sq ft i just move it from living room for daytime an bedroom in the evening. Casters make it easy to move on any type of flooring. Place cooler in-front of open window and open another window on the opposite side for circulation It uses about 10 gallons of water every 3-4 hours. Run it off a 1200 watt generator with no problems.|Positive
It was a lifesaver last summer when my air conditioning went out...it made a lot of 100 degree plus days a lot more bearable. Overall, it works great...love the red color & it is relatively quiet so it doesn't keep me awake at night.|Positive
the float valve worked great, honestly better then the last one I bought|Positive
It works great. Its the first time to replace the Bonaire cooler filter.|Positive
Works really good. Adding ice to the water makes it cool even better !|Positive
This is a good quality, heavy duty cooler cover, that should last a long time. I'm satisfied.|Positive
I recently purchased this unit after receiving a shockingly large electricity bill. I had heard several co-workers rave about their evap coolers and I was eager to try it out. I have a smaller house and this cooler has no problem keeping the entire house around 78 degrees. It's a little noisy but works wonders.|Positive
After years of use (6) the old one failed. The new one seals around the electrical and water lines by virtue of sewn-in hook & loop tape that replaces the old strap eyelets on the open edge. Much better!|Positive
I live in Hesperia, CA (high desert) and the only way anyone could cool off was to put it about a foot away from them. Even adding ice to the water bucket did very little to improve the temperature of a 10x10 room with a stand fan and a box fan in the room as well. You're better off spending more to get a window unit that will do what it's supposed to do rather than trying to save a few bucks. I had this unit for two weeks and just exchanged it today. I purchased a Champion Cooler (2800 CFM window model) that will be installed tomorrow.|Negative
It works as adv.|Positive
Heavy canvas material which is very good. Yes the coating does rub off some but that's to be expected for a water repellant item. Yes the color is bright. No big deal! There is no velcro corner seam! So if your electrical connection is at the top of one corner this probably won't work for you. Mine was, so I had to return it. Wish it would have had that provision.|Negative
The good, Quite, Compact, Filling is easy. Not so good, Can't come close to cooling 250,sq,ft. Water level indicated should have a visible float. Good little unit for a super price.|Positive
I’m very happy with the unit|Positive
I love this product! It works awesome, cools the air down very well.|Positive
Exact replacement for original. Drop-in installation.|Positive
I have a 2000 sq ft. 2 story house. I installed this 2 years ago no problems at all. Great unit runs quiet. People cant believe I have a Swamp cooler still. Of course I laugh all the way to the bank monthly. My French doors and windows are always open. Couldn't imagine a closed up prison...I mean house.|Positive
I use a single 4,500 CFM model Durango to cool my 1,100 square foot home. As long as I leave the windows and interior doors open, it does a fantastic job, and when it's hot, this unit can literally cool down the entire house in minutes. I mostly use the low setting, which draws about 200 watts. It's sufficient to maintain the house at around 74 degrees, depending on the outside humidity level. When I need more cooling or faster cooling, I use the medium setting, which draws about 350 watts and can get the house down to 70. My per-hour cost to run it on low is 5 cents, including the price of the water it bleeds off! That's a little more than 50 cents total on extremely hot days when it runs for up to 12 hours. Love it. One drawback is the noise. On low, it sounds like a box window fan. And it makes an almighty racket on the high setting. Luckily, I've never needed to go beyond medium. But even on low, you'll notice it, probably because unlike a roof or ground-mounted cooler, there's no intervening wall or attic filled with insulation to moderate the noise. The background noise is not irritating to me, but could easily become unbearable to someone who is very sensitive and demands a noiseless home. In this case, a ground-mounted MasterCool might be more appropriate, even though it will cost about double to buy and operate compared to this Durango. One final thing to note: This cooler is huge and heavy; probably much larger than you might imagine based on the picture. For window use, mounting it is a two-person job. I opted to permanently mount it through the wall. If you do this too, you'll want to insulate the cavities in the square neck so that it doesn't become a source of heat loss in the winter. It could also help to put a plug of rigid insulation board in the round section.|Positive
Was delivered in perfect condition and early. Works excellent in my garage workshop.|Positive
Delivery was convenient and start up a snap.|Positive
the canvis cover was easy to install but it should come with extra tie down straps. It took to long to get them when I ordered. I had to go back to the store because they did not come at the saame time as the cover even though I ordered them together.|Negative
On my cooler the Celdek was missing so i was useing a reg.cooler pad .Before i buy the Celdek i want to know if it really work and how well|Positive
Excellent low cost cooling option - can be supplemented to Air Conditioning. We didn't use AC last summer.|Positive
I've used this cooler 3 times so far and it seems to work well. It's fine for the 600 sq ft space that I use it for but would not recommend for 1600 sq ft but then that's probably true for almost all portable coolers and A/C units.|Positive
This valve replaced an identical unit that had deteriorated. Easy installation! TLW|Positive
Works great.|Positive
Fit great. Only suggestion would be for them to have more elastic around the bottom. That would make securing them easier.|Positive
Well built unit that works as it should. I am impressed with the company and satisfied with money well spent.|Positive
The cover is well constructed and windproof. However, many evaporative coolers, including mine are 48” x 48”. The closest size that will fit from Home Depot is 50” x 50” and it is overly generous. Also, it needs tie-downs and could use built-in horizontal cinches as well.|Negative
It installed easily, works great. Will probable buy another one in a couple of years to keep the parts new and working well.|Positive
The only problem I found is the water level indicator doesn't function (no biggie, I am running it from the auto-leveling hose hookup). Product performance is noteworthy and efficiently cools my large (34' x 36') tall garage and workshop (14' x 24') area very well and I live in central Florida. Not summer yet, but still only use the unit on low or medium.|Positive
Unit works great to cool down a room. Placement is critical because it needs air to work. I placed unit next to screened sliding glass door and opened windows at the opposite end of the room. The movement of cooled humidified air made the room feel cooler by 7-10 degrees. It felt cooler but the room temp didn't change. The honeycomb media got mildew after 2 weeks and it hasn't been the same since. Worse, I used only distilled water and scale was all over the inside water well. Took it to my backyard to spray down the scale but got the motor wet. That was it. The bearings started making whining noise and I knew it was kaput. Paid $230 but next time it will be a portable a/c.|Negative
Works great, fits perfect, sturdy. My only problem is the smell. The cover smells like oil. A strong odor that seeps through the vent. After putting the cover on I had to take a shower to get the smell out of my hands|Positive
Purchased motor, got home and prior to installing found the motor was seized. Had to exchange with new one which was easy to change and now works great|Negative
The cooler put so much humidity in the enclosed room (no windows) that it felt like a locker room after a sporting event.|Negative
Here are the pros and cons: *CONS* POOR QUALITY. Within a month, the fan started shaking and making noise when in the highest mode. Also, the pads on the side have an air gap, so air bypasses the pads, reducing efficiency. I had to stuff insulation to minimize this! NO PROVISION FOR TEMPERATURE CONTROL. The electronic control module that does not allow devices like the Lux WIN100 Thermostat. I called Mastercool and they said there were NO options for any type of temp control. POOR WATER DISTRIBUTION TO PADS. The water distribution unit does not place water over the pads equally. This is evident by the dry spots on the pads. *PROS* MASTERCOOL CUSTOMER SERVICE. These people were outstanding and responded to every issue I had, sending me basically all the insides of the unit: a fan, pump, tubing, water distribution unit, and even a remote.|Negative
This thing does not work!|Negative
We live in a one bedroom apartment and we purchased this unit thinking it was going to work for our little apartment or bedroom and it doesn't cool anything down. It makes your place musty, hot and smell like mold. You have to continue to add ice just so it will try and blow cool air out which only last maybe 2-3 minutes. This is not a product I would ever recommend to anyone! Make sure you definitely look into it before spending all that money on it.|Negative
We had one room in the house that was always several degrees hotter than the rest of the house. It's on the west side and above a garage. If my son was comfortable in that room the rest of house was too cold. This unit solved the battle of the thermostat. Everyone is happy.|Positive
It was just a “heat pushing fan.|Negative
Ready to use out of the box. Easy to use. Not quite capable of the 250 sq. ft. Water tank lasts about 6 hours. Kind of small. You have to wake up at night to refill the tank.|Negative
I am not sure what an evaporative cooler is, or why these straps would be packaged to indicate they are made specifically to hold down that kind of cooler. I am using them to hold down a car cover. They are long enough to completely wrap under and over my car to fully secure the cover, and the fabric weave strap material looks to be strong, durable and fairly weather-resistant. The metal cam buckles spring tightly closed, but the spring is exposed leaving some concern about it rusting and leading to eventual failure. I suppose only time will tell, but it doesn’t look encouraging (see picture). The 17’ length is reason enough to recommend it to others.|Positive
This cover will fit a bonair durango. I liked that it fit perfectly and keeps wind particles from coming in during windy season.|Positive
The cooler arrived packed well and without any issues. I have been using it for about three weeks and so far it has worked perfectly. The air output is very good, and the coverage area is much better (wider) than a comparable portacool unit. The plastic on the unit is not very thick, so time will tell how the durability is, but considering this unit is half the cost of the portacool the quality is still very good. At this point in time I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.|Positive
I like that its portable and can be moved around the house as needed. It takes alot of water. It puts out nice cool air. I like the timer on it and the different adjustments.|Positive
Got the unit from home depot and have it running for about an hour the most, then some squealing noise from the fan/motor then just stop.. seems like inside the motor bearing or something after run for a little bit get hot then grinding noise. Anyway, gonna return this junk back to its owner.. Hessair!|Negative
Nice.I bought one of these last year and they work very well!|Positive
This machine was easy to function and works great. Thank you!|Positive
I bought two of these coolers and have used them now thru an entire summer in Northern California. Temps here can and does hit 108F frequently. It is a dry climate and these coolers have worked much better than I anticipated. I did not turn on my expensive heat pump at all.The only minor draw back was a little motor noise, but it's not real bad.|Positive
Easy to follow instructions , you will need to purchase small crimp on round hole connectors for new wire install to the screws on the back .|Positive
Looks Nice, but wants distilled water to run on. Great for raising the humidity, but unless you sit right in front of it, kind of useless.. Took it back , and got an LG air conditioner.|Negative
With the fan on low this evaporative cooler constantly spits water 4 or 5 feet. On high, it continuously sprays water. Admittedly, I only used this device about 6 hours, but in that time everything within about 6 feet of the cooler was soaked. The carpet in front of the device was drenched. I know, you're probably thinking the dumb *ss overfilled it, but according the the water level indicator, it was never more half full. Manually filling the water reservoir was awkward at best. I tried several different containers. None were satisfactory. There is a connector to allow a garden hose to be connected to the cooler. I didn't use that, but possibly the results would be better. Additionally, it spewed an odd smell. It wasn't a fishy smell which you might associate with an appliance using water. And it wasn't a plasticy smell. But it was strong, pervasive, and continuous, and again, I only used it about 6 hours before boxing it up and returning it. This might be acceptable in an outdoor environment such as on a deck or patio where the water is not an issue.|Negative
This pump gives me the right amount of water flow making my evaporative cooler more efficient.|Positive
Frigiking 28x29 Aspen pads, P/N 5-2-217, are correct for my Brisa BW5002 coolers. There was some question about the thickness, which is about one inch. Some reviews said a two inch pad, or two one inch pads were needed, but I called Brisa/Frigiking/Phoenix Mfg Co & they confirmed the part number.|Positive
Works well!|Positive
Great. As advertised. Fast delivery.|Positive
Great fit, great price, and best of all, made here in the US.|Positive
Not much to say. It fit.|Positive
Weak and leaked under normal water pressure|Negative
Easy to install. Working okay so far.|Positive
A little difficult to put cover back on. Took 2 people to get it on tight .|Positive
I did not like the airflow doesn't seem to cool very much at all wish I would have got a bigger one|Negative
This was easy to set up and works great! I would purchase this swamp cooler again.|Positive
Easy adjustment mechanism for belt tension.|Positive
Nice item. Easy to install.|Positive
Good cover and fits well; a bit hard to tighten and pull tight, but not to bad.|Positive
Bought this cooler for a small bedroom about 12 x 10. Works pretty good. If you want a big difference you have to keep ice or freezer packs in the bucket.|Positive
I purchased this amazing Air Conditioner because we had our electricity go out on several occasions due to sand storms. One of them lasted 3 days and was over 110 degrees in our house due to the sun melting our electrical box. If I had a portable Air conditioner at the time, my neighbors would have helped us out with a cord, so I am prepared now and have enjoyed every ounce of this bad boy ever since.|Positive
It would work good for a sun room or closed garage but not an outside area. Because of the low CFM (1062) it really can't handle even a small patio area. The person sitting directly in front of it will feel cool air but no-one else. I will buy a 5000 CFM swamp cooler instead. The price is almost the same and you get 5x the output. I would recommend this unit but for inside use only!|Negative
So far so good! I've had 2 (different brands) break down. I'm hoping this works out!|Positive
Just returned a portable a/c unit from costco that couldn't cool a room ,no less a two story home,like this new Champion Cooler Window Evaporative Cooler I just got.I just put it in my nook area in my home 2 days ago,Easy installation ,a little odor in the beginning ,getting better,was told this is normal!!It is working better than expected .It works quicker than my central a/c.Like I said just got it but very happy right now,will keep you posted|Positive
It worked wonderfully for what I purchased it for. No complaints.|Positive
Needed a replacement for my Master Cool Pads, these fit perfectly. Now I have to wait for warmer weather to see how they perform.|Positive
"After spending a hour cleaning and prepping cooler for winter, I got out the cover I had to get online (because Home Depot only sells this cover online) out of the package and slid it over my cooler. First thing I noticed was the top panel was two pieces stitched together. Then I realized that although one side was correct the other side was 3"" to long. If they carried this in store I would have returned it, but I ended up folding material and securing it to finish the job so as not to wait for another one to be delivered. So I am upset about my cover, but I will say material and construction do seem adequate for the cover. Just wish I didnt have to order online for a common seasonal item"|Negative
Alright let's face it I'm cheap..So my central AC went out and since I couldn't get a free estimate from anyone in town. They wanted at least 100 bucks to just show up. That was not happening. So the husband says get one of those swamp coolers. After reviewing some and researching for a few days finally decided on this one, decent price good amount of square footage..ok done add to cart. it got here within the week and wow this made a difference. Air is cool and cools the room in a good amount of time. People we complaining about a bad smell, I didn't have that so that was nice. We have a second floor and we just kept taking it up and down depending on the hours of the day. So I just bought another one for the upstairs to keep the cats cool, they looked pretty uncomfortable. Well the second one had a smell but went away just by running on high for a few hours. I thought about a larger one but did't want it to be to loud. I just sounds like a large fan, no big deal turn up the tv! It does get a little humid depend on the day and the airflow from which windows are blowing in or sucking out. Fix that by running on fan only for an hour or so. If your reading this just listen to your spouse and order it. You won't regret it.|Positive
They use them in factories, they use them on athletic fields, now - use them in and around your home, be it bricks and sticks or motorhome/RV. Evaporative cooling - cools with no gases, no noisy compressor - just plain ol water, a radiator and a high speed fan. This jewel works like magic. Imagine sitting on your patio on a hot summer day with a cool mountain breeze blowing in your face - that's what this is like. No unruly vent hoses - just plug it into a 120vac outlet - fill the water tank or connect your hose for continuous water and you are all set. I have only used it outdoors in South Florida in the winter with temps in the mid to high 80's and high humidity - >51% but I can't wait to try it this summer up in the TN Smokys. Not a whisper quiet unit on high - but pretty quiet on low - great for indoor use too and much less costly than your typical room A/C unit. I highly recommend.|Positive
Cover fit my Bonaire cooler perfect|Positive
I like the finish of the cover which is not as thick & sticky finish as previous ones I have had. I am concerned about the fit. It fits tight which means after a winter or two any shrinkage will be a problem.|Positive
Fit as it should|Positive
very good price and easy to install|Positive
Received exactly what I ordered! Delivered in the time line as promised! Did comparative shopping, including from the factory, and Home Depot was the best bang for the buck with the shipping included!|Positive
The cooler is effective, but the water tank is quite small and must be refilled often. When the tank gets to about half full, the cooler makes this irritating sucking sound. There are other coolers that have a very much longer lasting time frame for cooling. I don't think this cooler would make it overnight despite the top 7.5 hour time limit. It's too bad because I really like the way it cools a small area.|Negative
The Aspen Snow pads worked out really well, fitted just right. The right size. Will order this item again next year.|Positive
The cooler is good, but it was a little banged up. The local Home Depot wouldn't give me a discount because I ordered it online. I would've had to lugged the guant heavy beast back to the store, which would then ship it back to wherever it came from, and wait for a new one.|Positive
Size wasn't quite right, didn't come with enough spacers.|Positive
Order W826464862.Est Delivery Mar 20-27. on Mar 27 informed Est Deliv Mar 30 or Apr 02. Now April 2, 2018 at 5:40pm PDT. No word and NO cooler. Where is it?|Negative
Fabric was average. Don’t know how it will hold up with coming winter weather.|Negative
Good fit and heavy, quality, canvas! Great investment and should hold up well!!|Positive
was what I needed|Positive
Arrived on time and was easy to install. Great!|Positive
I have a window unit and this doesn't work like it's supposed to because mine had to be hung with chains like any window unit and there is no way to use this properly with my window unit|Negative
I bought this for my backyard, it gets pretty hot in Phoenix during the summer. I couldn't be more pleased. Looks good, is really quiet and really cools the area down.|Positive
The cooler is quiet as compared to other box type fans. The air is substantially cooler than without. I recommend this unit.|Positive
pads were too thin,but do work.|Negative
We use this in our garage we use for outdoor living. It takes the temp down by about 15 degrees which is welcome in Texas!|Positive
Works great! Great for when you might need to replace or upgrade|Positive
the motor that came with the Champion Evaporative Cooler had a vibrating motor in it. This motor replaced it and it is now running smoothly.|Positive
After putting ice in the ice bin (which is a super cool feature btw), my room gets significantly colder than the rest of the house. And that's only on the low setting. When the fan is on low, the nose is reasonable, but the higher settings can get a bit loud. I also don't mind the sound of the water pumping. It's like my own personal quiet waterfall. The water tank is large, so I only have to fill it up once a day and it will run all afternoon and most of the night. You'll have to fill the ice bin a couple times to keep the air cooler though. We'll see how it holds up this summer in the AZ heat. Just make sure to leave a door open or crack some windows or the humidity will build up.|Positive
I have used this product before and for the price , you are getting your money's worth. Tha one before lasted more than six years and you just can't beat that!!|Positive
I bought this unit for work. I am a auto repair technician in a large shop. It kept me cool all summer. It moves around easily and even holds parts on top when needed. Two other techs followed my example so we all had personal cooling. With all of them going the overall shop was cooler than ever. I already had a 120 at home. The 130 was the necessary size for the bigger space.|Positive
Easily assembled. Great cooling!|Positive
The fan speed is quick. its a good product for any house. much needed for the summer or hot weather.|Positive
Durable and strong material, soft enough to be very manageable. A good product in general, I am satisfied.|Positive
This pump works great, I will buy again.|Positive
Its easy to install,but very difficult to clean main filter. It's very helpful for room hummed,thanks.|Positive
is is a great product to use in my shed. Really cools down the shed on a hot day. Movable on its caster legs to put anywhere u want too.|Positive
This brand of cooler cover is made of high quality materials and the velcro corner makes a much better air seal than the lace-up types. The shipping was very fast too. I will be back.|Positive
2200 sq ft home. Air flows around all corners to the open window in the back of the house. Hay it's a swamp cooler yes it's noisy at high speed. Time will tell on quality of unit.|Positive
This is basically a kit that fits multiple swamp coolers. I wasn't super happy with the quality, but with the ease and convenience of having it delivered to my house for free, I would purchase it again.|Negative
Does the job. Lowers the air temp by 10-12 degrees. Need to load water every 4-5 days after running most the night.|Positive
Disappointed with quality - the plane of the pulley was not flat, and it was not perpendicular to the shaft mount hole. As a result, the pulley perimeter wobbles at least ½” when spun on a mounted known straight shaft.|Negative
it does a good job|Positive
This cooler works better then I was told it would. Cools down the house quick and keeps it cool.|Positive
It stayed at 88 degrees Day and Night even after adding ice. Pads barely got wet. I'll be sending it back.|Negative
Works well, just has to dial in the correct amount of airflow through the room.|Positive
Will work but needs to be constantly refilled.|Positive
this is an attempt to save my cooler from the damage of Phoenix hard water. So far (this is the first season I am using it) it seems to be helping with the calcium build-up on the cooler pads and interior.|Positive
The panels fit probably and are working properly. The only problem was the damaged shipping container which resulted in damaged panel. Oh well, probably got damaged by shipper|Positive
The cover was delivered fast and was easy to use.. love it..|Positive
Does make working in shop somewhat better in this hot weather.|Negative
Went on like a glove. Looks good. Material looks like it should last more than 1 winter.|Positive
Just started using this and am quite pleased. Easy to fill and not heavy. It cools nicely. I would recommend.|Positive
We have two, one for each of our girls and so far they are quite pleased. The units are not noisy but have a very pleasant white noise quality like wind which they both enjoy since we now live in a condo and are used to an actual home with less noise. The oscillating feature is great. Rather than the whole unit moving, just the directional slats move which may be one reason the unit is so quite. I only gave a 4 on ease of use because a couple times the unit has been on without water. Not the fault of the unit, really but I wonder if, for future units, there would be a way for them to shut off when the water runs dry. That said, I was very pleased to note the number of useage options the units offer and even without the water, as long as its set to fan rather than cool the cooling effect is quite good. The timer was also a nice surprise...not terribly intuitive but still very easy to learn. since the tank runs out over night when the weather is particularly dry, we find the timer to be a good way to keep the unit from running with en empty tank. Overall we are very pleased and have recommended it to others and are likely to purchase a larger one for our living room. Overall value, too, is surprisingly good. I can highly recommend this unit and am so glad I found this website! PS - we live in a hot climate without a/c and these units have made life a lot more pleasant.|Positive
These are terrible. The plastic looks cheap, and the louvers won't stay attached to the body of the diffuser. I'm going to take mine down and put up another brand.|Negative
Light weight and cools relatively well. Fan is noisier than I had hoped, but the cooling makes up for that. At first the water tank would only empty half way before it would act like it couldn't suck up any more. But after using it daily for a little over a month, it is now sucking up almost all of the water before acting like it can't suck up any more. The small ice packs are okay, but we find that keeping a water jug in the refrigerator so the water we put in it is cold, and then just dumping the ice maker box from our freezer into the cold water, works best.|Positive
I love this fan that does exactly what it is supposed to do in cooling my small living room. The building management switches the A/C over to heat from October until May every year. Denver, CO experiences so many hot days in October and part of November as well as March and April every year. I have a smaller evap. cooler in my bedroom so I reallly wanted a slightly bigger cooler for my living room. I was not sure if this evap. cooler would work against the heating system that radiates from the piping in the wall in my living room. I am so happy as this NewAir-310 Tower Evaporative Cooler cools the room down from 86 degrees to 78 degrees. I am an older lady over 60 yrs old with Asthma so I cannot be overheated. I love alll the settings as well. I put mostly ice with the ice pack. This was an excellent purchase. I am very happy I bought this fan especiallly since this is a dry climate!|Positive
Unit was easy to install and operates well.|Positive
Works wonderfully|Positive
This was given to me as a gift and I can tell you this things worth it's weight in gold. It's really easy to set up and I've got mine strapped to a furniture dolly so it's portable. I live in Las Vegas and with 100+ weather being the norm, I'm greatful to have it. We use it on the back patio, in the shed, and the 2 car garage. It keeps us cool and we put a block of ice in it for extra comfort.|Positive
I read the other reviews prior to purchase. I found them helpful. I agree the documentation is not great and should be revised. However the unit itself is great. Installation is easy except for replacing the front cover is a bit tricky and manual was useless, however it was not hard at all. Installation hardware well other than plenty of screws included are provided. The unit comes fully assembled out of the box however I was not able to locate any serial number on or in the unit. The pump and motor is included. (Not the Purge Pump) The unit is well built, but just a tiny bit loud a noise baffle could be a nice asset but not needed. Great air movement. I will update this review on this units to 5 stars if Rigid Media proves to be great after it has been in use for a while. The company did not have the saturation percentage for the media any where to be found after doing research and talking with their support folks they claim it to be about 85% which meets the requirements by Excel Energy for the Rebate program, AND IT IS LISTED on Excel Energy's 2013 approved equipment list (YIPPEE) This makes the cost of ownership quite small.|Positive
Need some basic knowledge of valve assembly. A little difficult to clean up inside of the cooler. Needs to unscrew all 4 screws to open it up. However, it works very well and is able to cool down the rooms fairly quickly. Stylish looking.|Positive
Son said it was easy to use and fit well|Positive
so far so good! Checked the net and found this to be my best buy after timely consideration, a broking ac unit on a 106 degree day made my decision for me. very happy with the investment that will pay for itself here in the high desert of California. picked it up at the store here in Lancaster, CA. i would recommend this product to anyone living in a dry climate. right now it is 81 outside and 77 (started at 88 about 3 hours ago)inside on the first night. that is in a 1588 square foot house. bedroom doors open, ceiling fan on and windows cracked. defiantly worth the investment.|Positive
The Cyclone 3000 was a great choice for keeping my horse cooler during the super hot/humid Texas summers. He was having problems dealing with the heat during the day. My vet recommended getting a Portacool for him. Its set up in front of the stall, the stall door is open (and a rope across so he can't get out), and it is effective in keeping him more comfortable. All the barn windows and barn doors are left open; and even in high humidity the portacool works to keep him cooler. We've tried using just regular fans in the stall, but adding the portacool too has helped tremendously. I highly recommend it for barns, sheds, kennels, to keep your animals cooler in the summers. I also like that the pump automatically shuts off when the water has run dry. You can have a hose connected to it to always fill; or if no hose is available you can fill it manually. It does go through water quickly though and needs refilling every 2-3 hours if no hose is connected. Being in a barn, the spray bar does clog frequently and just needs to be rinsed out. Portacool customer service is great- the fan switch toggle came off and we couldn't get it to work again- so they sent a whole new fan/pump switch unit for free since it was still under warranty. It is expensive, at $800, but worth the investment and my horse loves it!|Positive
So far it is still going around. My shaft had Keeway with odd key. No one had the right one so I turned it 180 and trimmed to fit. Need new cooler next year!|Positive
I ordered this item on line and it was delivered ahead of the scheduled delivery time. The cover was an exact fit and of good quality. Very durable and good looking.|Positive
Fits absolutely perfectly. Don't know how durable as I just received it.|Positive
We ordered two for our facility. The first one I opened was fine and worked well. The second one out of the box had the vertical strut laying inside the case and the water valve twisted so the float didn't work. Instead of sending it back I just fixed the two issues. A few days later I realized that the second one wasn't wet on the back pad. Opened it up again and found the tubes were twisted and kinked so no water would run. Fixed that and it's working OK. It did overflow once and I could not figure out why. They both cool pretty well now. Build quality and quality control is lacking. They are very cheap for the price charged. Probably only worth half what they sell for.|Negative
Seems to work pretty good. But haven't used it much yet.|Negative
Excellent cooler|Positive
Very happy with the quality and value of this product.....|Positive
Get a sharp knife to cut. Great look and very durable. Will replace any fill|Positive
I've had this cooler for over a year now and I was happy with it for the first few months. It cools nicely and holds alot of water. The water gauge did break quickly, but you can check the level by dipping your fingers in the filler hole, so not such a big deal. It also does not have a start timer, just a shut off timer. And, if you use it when you aren't home (as I do for my pets) and the power goes out, it does not automatically turn back on when the power turns on due to the electronics. I've also found the back dificult to remove and the medium doesn't appear to be easy to change. Now for the deal breaker. The motor that runs the fan started going out after a few months. Now, it won't turn at all. I paid quite alot to get just a few months use out of it. I'm buying a new one for this year, but DEFINITELY not this brand or model. Too many things went wrong. It's junk.|Negative
This is the second one of these we've purchased for our home and I've purchased about 6 of them for my office. They work very well for an extra bit of coolness|Positive
This is a great product, but at $95.00 is horrendously overpriced.|Negative
This blows COLD !!! The bedroom is the hottest room in the house and hard to cool w/ the AC. This has cooled the room down tremendously and is a huge energy $ saver! Home Depot's free, next day shipping made the deal even sweeter. It will pay for itself in the first month, for sure. I HIGHLY recommend it!|Positive
I was looking for a cheap replacement float valve for my furnace mounted humidifier. When I ordered this one I knew it was too long for my humidifier. I shortened up the float arm to fit my appliance, installed it and it works fine. Humidifier is back up running fine and wife no longer complains of static shocks.|Positive
It was easy to get it started just by adding water and turning it on. I was surprised that it was blowing cool air within a 20 min wait. I bought a 2nd one.|Positive
High quality product, excellent service and shipping. Was disappointed that the product was no longer carried in store. But the fast shipping made up for it, you can't go wrong with an excellent product!|Positive
Easy to use right out of box, I just added water and turned it on. It cools the part of the house that needs it and I am very satisfied with this product. I love having the timer.|Positive
work good|Positive
Great evaporative cooler. Cooled the rooms down quickly and quietly. Easy to use and move about.|Positive
Easy to install. No real adjustments necessary. This float will last for many seasons with minimal maintenance.|Positive
Since we don't have sash Windows, there are too many ways to install an air conditioner. This is a bit noisier than we'd like, but the air is cool.|Positive
If you’re expecting some great cooling for a single room or house this won’t do that, 1000CFM isn’t what is passed through this unit. It will help supplement your evapcooling but as a stand along I wouldn’t purchase again. Cooling a 10 x 12 room was never accomplished with this unit.|Negative
I was very skeptical but this product works very well. I have it in my bedroom and it’s down right chilly in there now.|Positive
Purchased and installed unit in June of 2017. Here we are in July of 2018 and the water pump just broke. The warranty is 1 year for parts. Missed a warranty claim by 1 month. The 8 year warranty is only if the unit rusts out. The previous unit lasted for over 15 years before we had any issues with it.|Negative
Had to return it. It just spewed out water and did not cool the room down. However, it was a good fan.|Negative
I live in Az and it's very hot and dry! I work from home and love this fan!|Positive
We purchased this cooler for our 500 sqft garage to make the AZ summers more comfortable for my husband's workspace. It has done a great job in keeping this space cool. Would highly recommend.|Positive
Dad anda i love it!|Positive
Exactly what I needed. Happy with my purchase|Positive
Slipped right on, a perfect fit.|Positive
the electronics on one of them went bad in about 14 hours fan is stuck on one mode and 3 fan speeds are lit up which is not possible,, pump already broke|Negative
Every time I need a swamp belt... Here ya go! Enough said...|Positive
This unit works well for the price and size, it was easy to put up and maintain, no problems with operation.|Positive
Good Air cooler for the price. Shown exactly as received & no problems with shipping (well packed). Overall, very satisfied with this purchase. It really does cool down the room & adds moisture into the air.|Positive
This is just like the original that came with my swamp cooler.|Positive
Port -A-Cool Cyclone 3000 works great . Keeps me cool in the Texas heat. Ralphie loves it too, he's a Cyclone hog! This machine has been serving me well for over five years now and going strong.|Positive
Since it is the purge pump that the manufacturing recommends yes it work fine.|Positive
The filters work great easy to install. Have a bit of a wet dog smell for the first few days, but after the filters get saturated the smell goes away, and filters work great!|Positive
Nice light, good quality pulley to modify my band saw to cut metal. Perfect fit.|Positive
After putting it together I noticed got that that oscillator did not work and made a very loud noise. I contacted home Depot let them know I was going to bring it back. But unfortunately I just had surgery and I can't left anything heavy.( hence, why I had it delivered to my house in the first place) bummed and super hot here!|Negative
The unit is not good. After I istalled it on the faucet it leaks right away(dripping water). Right now I put a bucket undernrath to catch water. That is why I am not happy with the product.|Negative
It does above and beyond what I expected although it is for a small to medium room it does the job well. Everything works fine timer, remote, triple speed and swing fan. I like it most because it is portable easy to move and you don't need to hook it to a hose it holds plenty of water for good 8 hours plus.|Positive
Fits very well and easy to put on|Positive
Really works great|Positive
Works perfectly, no issues.|Positive
Unfortunately the packaging is weak and so the unit is susceptible to damage which of course the one I picked up was make sure you check the unit before you leave the store|Negative
Seems to be doing a great job for us. However, quiet it is not. Very noisy.|Positive
Great evaporative cooler for a bedroom. Easy to install.|Positive
It's a lifesaver, Use it daily in warmer weather!|Positive
The cooler use to much water &it also doesn’t cool the room, I wasted money . Would not recommend it to any one,|Negative
Fits Mastercool Ultra cool ADA70 as advertised!|Positive
The product is ok built kinda real cheap Where to put water and ice in is not very sturdy. Water pump works soso. Fan part is very good great air flow|Negative
Didn’t seem to work any better than a regular fan- I will be returning it|Negative
easy installation - great product. Cools our house down very quickly|Positive
These pads fit correctly and easy to install.|Positive
Had unit delivered, installation was easy. Turned unit on low cool for several hours. Didn't seem to be doing much. Turned it on high cool. Sounded like an air boat was going through my house. After about 15 minutes the fan quit. Went up on the roof and felt the motor, which was blazing hot. After letting it cool turned it back on low and ran it for a few more hours. Never did seem to cool much. Didn't dare try high again. Finally just turned it off and returned it a few days later. They [Home Depot ] gave me a full refund, which was good. But was very disappointed in the cooler. Went back to the old squirrel cage.|Negative
took it to Torreón Mexico, 95-100^ weather, and it worked great !|Positive
The Mastercool 5000 CFM is perfect for my 1600+ square foot home. When operating, it is whisper quite. I don't believe you could get a better cooling unit for the same price.|Positive
We live in western Washington where evaporative coolers are not normally used. The summers here normally have middle level humidity, but this summer has been unusually dry. I decided to try an evaporative cooler and have not been disappointed. It cools the house 10 to 15 degrees cooler than without the cooler. It had been 90° in the house at the end of the day, now it is anywhere from 68 to 78 depending on the outside temperature. The quality seems okay for an evaporative cooler, which is basically a water pump and an air pump inside a large metal box.|Positive
My evaporation cooler is more then fifteen years old. It still works great after hearing replacement cost made us we just want to protect it from the leaves and weather. Hoping if we keep leaves and dirt out of the motor should help us keep it going as is for a while longer. The Hurricane fabric is engineered to be up to 200% stronger and 80% more water-resistant than cotton canvas. Two vent panel reduces inside condensation and wind lofting. It has adjustable side lacing system for a fast and secure fit. Advanced fabric does not need to be wrapped, this one Fits 40 in. W x 40 in. D x 31 in. H.|Positive
this unit produces a lot of noise which makes it impossible to stay nearby.|Negative
This is by far the best cooler we have ever bought. It does an excellent job of cooling the area in the garage. It does have just one minor problem that should be addressed. The hose input connection and fittings should be made a little longer. The brass fitting does not tighten enough to keep it from leaking. Solution should be to change the washer to a thicker one, OR as I did, use some plumbers tape on the threads to seal it well. The description says it is 2 speed, when in fact it is 3 speed, a real plus. The unit puts out a great volume of air, so be prepared .... we love it and would definitely buy another if this one ever dies.|Positive
I have had this item for a few weeks, it looks good, runs quiet, takes the edge off stifling heat in a small area. The small footprint is good. I ordered this on line through home depot. It came with a leaky water tank but the Luma people sent me a new tank promptly and I was able to install it. The only down side was that there were no instructions for removing and replacing that tank. It was fussy, requiring some analysis, but I like taking things apart. I plan to get a second one.|Positive
Fit well|Positive
There was a forest fire close, so we needed something to cool the bedroom because we we unable to open our windows. It did the job but is very loud.|Negative
It met my full expectations and it is strong and quiet. JW|Positive
Works great, using for camping lowers air temperature where your able to enjoy being outdoors.|Positive
I'm not sure I'd call this product excellent, but it gets five stars because it does meet expectations. I've had similar units before.|Positive
It fit my swap cooler that measured 36 x 36x 36 I was afraid it would be to small but it was not|Positive
"We live in Southern Colorado at 7500 ft. Hot and dry here in the summer. Our house's second floor has poor window placement to allow for a cross breeze. Since the laundry room was upstairs, I was able to run a ""Y"" from the washer supply and run a hose to the unit. It was 90 degrees upstairs and within 30 minutes it was 75. Now it's routinely around 68-70 by the time we the grown ups go to bed. We turn it off in the morning and back on in the afternoon. Of course we leave windows open as instructed. Amazing product. It's no exaggeration to say it really changed our life in the summer time."|Positive
We used this cooler all of last summer and we are very pleased with its cooling. I believe one of the major problems is the cooler lines clogging up with water residue from bacteria and algae or similar and therefor like all other coolers should be fed with an antibacterial agent. We will definitely buy a second Arctic Cove 500 this year.|Positive
I was really hoping for a better head pressure, oh well.|Positive
these never last more than 1 summer in kern county, ca.|Negative
it fit and it blocks the wind..... its great|Positive
I bought 2 of these before I got one that wasn't cracked in the bottom--had to remove and take back to store 2 times!!! Then when installed water leaks thru mounting screws at the bottom. I found a way to slow the leaks with calking. But I still like the cooler being slim. This unit needs more Enginiering.|Negative
The Cooler is working great at this point. I am disappointed in the quality of the workmanship and would hope that as an American Made product the people doing the Assembly should get together and decide if they want to continue working at the plant ? I expect when I go out searching for any product Made in America (which is always my first choice) that I can be happy with that product and not find Loose and Stripped out screws and missing nuts and bolts. Along with Dents and dings that show me workers tossing around what will be My Cooler for many years. Take some PRIDE and make sure we are satisfied with your work....|Positive
The pieces were the correct sizing and there was not special fitting required to make the item work correctly.|Positive
This cooler was a replacement for an old one that rusted out. It's outlet is exactly the same size and shape of the old one, so I reused the fillers I made a decade ago. Installation was easy, there have been some changes, mostly relocation of internal components. My wife loves the remote control. She can control the temperature easily. I recommend this one for anyone that lives in the desert like us.|Positive
The product does not expectations and I will return it. It does not always wet the pads when it is primed. Not happy.|Negative
works well with the extreme cold temps currently the area is having. keeps attic warmer making the whole house warmer|Positive
Received fast way faster than anticipated. Would use this product again|Positive
Absolutely love this purchase. Purchased a second one for our upstairs. Definitely would recommend. Cools so well.|Positive
Fits the unit like a glove, great durable material.|Positive
This cooler works wonderfully on these hot East Coast days. We were pleasantly surprised at how easy is to use. It has a small footprint so it does not take up a lot of room. It keeps our living area quite comfortable without making it freezing cold. It is quiet. Love it. If you are looking for icy coldness this is not that. But for us it is fine.|Positive
This evaporative cooler is great! It was a cinch to install (although you definitely want at least two people to move it--it's heavy-ish and unwieldy). According to the info for the unit, we are in zone 2, and our house is almost 1800 square feet. This cooler keeps it cool enough that it can be almost chilly! We installed the unit on the second floor where it was hottest, and placed it over the stairs. It keeps the entire house cool, no sweat. Get it? NO SWEAT?!|Positive
I received this product complimentary and I just love that it was easy to use and even more so to set up. It does cool down the space and I feel like it started to feel different in my room within 15 minutes of using. It is not 100% quiet, but is silent enough to calmly be used in a room while sleeping and it did not give me a headache while running. The size is good for the kind of product and it fits nicely in a smaller section of the room. I am going to look forward to using it more so in the hotter months. The style and design is very appealing to look at and it was easy to clean which is a huge plus for me. The brand is great and the quality is there.|Positive
We currently live in a rental home that has an old a/c unit and old, original windows. We've done everything we can to seal up windows and doors, but the a/c unit is old and tired, it just can't keep up. We keep the thermostat at 80 degrees and the air conditioner still can't keep up. We needed this evaporative cooler for some additional help through the summer months and since this home is a rental, we didn't want to spend a lot of money. This evaporative cooler is the best investment we've made! Upon bringing the box inside from my porch, I was shocked at how light weight it is. It was packaged nicely and very easy to remove from the box. It's a very simple set up and not at all confusing. It holds a ton of water that lasts a few days before needing to be refilled. I absolutely love all of the options. There are multiple fan speeds, it oscilates, it has a timer on it. This can be used as just a fan or as an evaporative cooler. Upon using this for the first time, our a/c thermostat in the house dropped a degree within 30 minutes. I was shocked and so very happy. It has kept the inside of our home so much more comfortable. This cooler is very quiet and helps us out so much! 3 days of using it and I'm still extremely excited to have it. I love that it comes with a remote control, too! This cooler is also on castors, so it's easy to wheel around to wherever you may need it. I can't say enough good about this thing, it's been a game changer for us. It cools our living room, dining room and kitchen with ease. You won't be disappointed!!!|Positive
It fit well. The only short coming is the draw strings would be nice if they were longer to give a tighter wrap.|Positive
This small Air Cooler is amazing. I use it when I’m applying makeup. I highly recommend it.|Positive
I've had the unit for 3 summer seasons now. DIYA installed, not a big deal. Water and electrical hookups were straight forward. Have the 1HP motor to really move air. As far as what it's made for…it does a GREAT job of cooling the house, even on low. Far superior to our old 4-sided downdraft evaporative cooler. I ***HATE*** the start up and tear down of this thing in the spring and fall. It's such a HUGE PAIN IN THE BUTT to get into. If I want to fully access the water tray to clean out the dirt and minerals, or the pads, I have to take off the full cover of the unit to do so! The side panels remove easily by the fly-wheel, so I can easily unplug the pump and blower motor and reach in for the water valve…but to remove the side panels where the water tray and pads are…I hate it. This could have been remedied with a better design, but it wasn't so now I find myself wanting to pay someone else to get up there, except I doubt they would take the top off to thorough clean and prepare the unit for the summer cooling or winterization.|Positive
The unit works very well! Never had any experience with this type of product and are very pleased with its performance!|Positive
I bought one of these 2 weeks ago. The box was sealed, but the instructions and remote were missing. HD opened another box and replaced the missing items. The unit worked for a week, then the water pump went out. I took it back to Home Depot and got a replacement and after a week, the water pump went out on it as well. I have made multiple calls to Mastercool but it seems they are always in meetings and are unable to return phone calls. I will be returning this unit and buying a different brand.|Negative
The cooler came with everything it said and on time. There was a small dent in one of the panels but works great.|Positive
Air flow not what I expected.|Negative
This unit cools the house great. It is no noisier than an oscillating fan. It will run as a fan and an evaporate cooler and can be easily moved from room to room. Great bargain for the money.|Positive
The cooler worked well, it cools my upstairs by about 20 degrees. The water tank has to be filled at least twice a day and it is also a humidifier so, things in it's area feels slightly damp.....but overall well worth it.|Positive
Recently purchased this Newair swamp cooler because my portale ac just takes up too much room. This cooler is much quieter, and the tall narrow design takes up very little space. It actually cooled down my living and dining rooms by 15 degrees. At night, I move the cooler into my bedroom. And even at the lowest setting, it's strong enough to help me sleep comfortably.|Positive
I was nervous about getting this but the family likes it. We leave it in an open door and it cools the house well. It is loud, as all coolers are, but does push the air through and out the back door and windows in the bedrooms. We cool 1400 sq/ft in an extremely well insulated ICF/Foam board house. If you have used coolers then this will please. For AC people it is NOT an AC so go find a friend with one and see if it is what will work for you.|Positive
Tearable product and tearable customer service.|Negative
This evap cooler is very nice looking and came as stated on the order. However it didn't put out enough cool air to cool the room. If I sat right in front of it I was cool but that was the extent. It didn't seem to matter if I left a window open a little or a lot or not at all. The remote was nice. I returned it to the store.|Negative
It was wrong product no good for me|Negative
Just got mine last week, panels are thin and flimsy, one was dented, there was no drain bung , blower is out of balance and noisey!!!|Negative
have not put them in yet, waiting for the cotton to stop flying from cotton wood trees as it clogs the filters|Negative
Unit was easy enough for handyman to install to replace existing but he did a poor job. Motor included would have been nice as former tenant stole the motor out of the old shell. Looks good and works well.|Positive
Cooler works OK but case is rather flimsy.....water door broke almost immediately,,,fixed it with velcro, It also is rather loud for use in a mobile home, It does work OK though and cheaper than regular A/C|Negative
Works great as a fan that creates a cool breeze. A reminder it is not an Air Conditioner the cool moist breeze is great and I really like mine. I use it on a covered porch and outdoor kitchen.|Positive
Product is good. Have 4 of them used in greenhouse application. Lower rating because unit had been dropped, pulling fan assembly away from unit body. This required a good deal of extra work pulling the fan back into proper location and re-drilling and bolting fan back in place. The unit was inspected at pickup but you could not tell that it had been dropped without completely removing the box from the unit. It had been dropped flat, no dents. I could have returned the unit but I couldn't really afford the turn around time so I fixed it instead. I highly recommend very careful inspection on pick up.|Negative
The cooler was exactly what I needed, easy to install, minimal adjustments and performs as expected.|Positive
This evaporative cooler motor is reliable and is made well with heavy duty housing. Two speed switchable motor and semi-quite operation.|Positive
Not real good quality.|Negative
Very quick to assemble on my roof.|Positive
Not cool enough...|Negative
did the job and was easy to install.|Positive
I got this to help cool the 900 sq ft garage with no insulation and 100 degree weather. Honestly nothing will cool that beast. However it will send enough cool breeze my way that I can stay in the Cave longer in a smaller space. If the temp is less than 90 it cools the entire area and is nice. All in All I am not the least bit regretting this purchase. North Texas and medium humidity.|Positive
Well I did use the A/C about two weeks ago but now I'm not worried about the unit overheating and it's getting cold and rainy so goodbye Indian Summer. This cover is so nice, heavy duty and simple to install that it's hard to believe this size was under $10. That's twice what the installer charged me for the plastic one that lasted one winter. It is double stitched and has openings for venting that are fully netted. The material they call Hurricane fabric feels much like the same fabric my mower cover is made of which has lasted years. It has a drawstring on the bottom to tighten it down and mine came with an additional length of rope for extra security. As I still had my old evaporator strap I used that halfway up as well because it does get very windy here. You might want to pick one up at HD they are not much and just in case it's much better than trying to find it after a storm or watching it fly like a kite. If yours has a lip under you might not consider it necessary as you can get a better grip with the drawstring.|Positive
Use this in our mechanic shop. Rolls easily to where it is needed. Large capacity tank makes it easy to fill and move without hose across the floor. Three speed fan makes airflow adjustable to fit the area we are working. This is almost all plastic so rust should be less of a problem. Guys like it.|Positive
Very unbalanced, had to throw in trash|Negative
Fits fine . The tie cord could be a bit larger diameter , that would have made it easier to tie . The one supplied did the job. I did add extra ties to secure the top and upper sides .|Positive
You definitely get what you pay for. This is one big fan and Swamp cooler. It just didn't meet my expectations to chill our medium size bedroom a few degrees. Works better with constant ice at the top.|Negative
I got this product, and use it in my office and upstairs hallway. It keeps my small office nice and cold. It helps so much with our upstairs hallways where there are no vents for our AC to reach, helping keep the upstairs comfortable during warmer days. Its lightweight and really easy to use. The ice packs dont take too long to freeze up when you need them, even without the ice packs, this fan has some power to it. I recommend it to all my friends and family.|Positive
"This unit does a good job of cooling. My living/dining area is the SW corner of my home and probably totals about 600 sf with vaulted, poorly insulated ceiling. Climate here keeps outside humidity generally around 10% and my inside humidity will range +/- 5% of 30%. On days in the mid 90's, my living/dining area will easily reach 95 degrees. This unit, with the help of a couple other fans to circulate air through the house (drawing dry air in and expelling humid air) has kept the rooms below 80 degrees. Pros: *Cools well. *Tall cabinet circulates cool air around the room and oscillating fins aid that. *Great control panel conveniently located on top with LCD indicator that shows timer, oscillations of fins, fan on/off/speed, and pump on/off, all features controlled by separate buttons. *Audible beeps warn of low water level is reliable and works independently of mechanical visual water level indicator. Cons: *Little door for adding water isn't convenient unless you use a hose to fill it. *Back panel needs to be opened to change media or repair internals. Very, very difficult to open. Should be hinged. A redesign is needed here to make it ""lift and swing"" to open. *Mechanical water level indicator is sticky and unreliable, even after lubricating with silicone. I would attempt to fix it, but opening the back panel is daunting. *Cheap hard plastic casters mar my hardwood floor. *Fan is noisy. *Water running off media and dripping back into tank is surprisingly loud. Can be drowned out with fan set to high."|Negative
I made a comparison between this and the Luma comfort EC45S. This is 500 CFM (cubic feet / minute) exactly twice the volume of the smaller model. It's about twice the size and blows a lot louder and stronger. But it has much greater cooling power. I use it mostly for exausting the living room / kitchen / dining nook. But it will cool people in any of those rooms with a cooler pointed directly at you.|Positive
This unit works great! It keeps my main living room area comfortable in hot degree weather. I live in the high desert area, strong heat on some days. Construction is sturdy enough. It has a large water reservoir, will run for 6-8 hours on a very hot day, before needing a refill. It does NOT have wheels however, although it can be lifted with water in the resevoir. I never got the water fill gage to work properly though. It does need to be in a well ventilated area with the back of the unit facing an open area with lots of ventilation. I have it placed near a large sliding glass patio door. I am very happy that I purchased this cooler. It does what I expected it to do which is to keep the main room in a small upstairs southwest facing apartment , more comfortable and cooler. I do not use A/C in my apartment. I have had this cooler for about one week.|Positive
Perfect fit for my Champion Cooler 5000 CFM .|Positive
easy to use and made cooler cover much more secure in wind|Positive
For the price, this unit did not perform as I had wished. The cooling effect was not much better than a high powered fan. I will be returning the unit to the store for a refund.|Negative
The cabinet, motor, and pump are fine. The controller however; barely lasted one season.|Negative
Good quality canvas material. Will cover my cooler when winter arrives.|Positive
Works great for my application.|Positive
It was slightly damaged due to shipping, the water pump for the evaporate cooler had to be replaced it did not work at all when I took it out of the box. I replaced it at Home Depot and its too big for it, it will blow water on med or high settings regardless of the water blow by. Little struggle getting the outer housing on and figuring out the water pump lines, but once it was setup in the window it really works well and cools the entire upstairs of my home, approx. 1400 square feet even on its lowest setting. I like it.|Positive
We use this inside out 5000 sq/ft shop and it works great!|Positive
Bought 4 weeks ago and works very well on my patio. Had to install the wheels the rest was already assembled.|Positive
I normally do not write reviews but I felt inspired this time. Purchase the Champion 5500 side draft swamp cooler. After 1 month the pump motor went out. The side panels are very hard to remove especially the side where the electrical box is located inside the unit - door rubs the electrical cords - no way around it. I have a feeling that if I get 5yrs out of this one I will be lucky. Not sold with a motor - what is up with that? Certainly not worth the $500 I spent for the thing but could not find anything much better in my area. Fortunately Home Depot normally is good about exchainging bad parts and that is why I shop there. If you can find a different brand - check it out !|Negative
We purchased these pads for a different manufacturer of cooler with similar dimensions. Everything worked out great.|Positive
Cheap plastic toy. Not worth the price. Worthless!!|Negative
Works well. Pretty quiet.|Positive
not as helpful as I expected|Negative
Works great. Run on low cools very well. Have not had to turn up to high.|Positive
it meets expectations, the use is inside an area of 600 sqft , it is intended for half of it, there is no way install a hose, and it did not call my attention at first, but it has an opening were to put water into the tank. it works well|Positive
Good product and price I'll recommend and buy again|Positive
very easy to install|Positive
this product is very good. It arrived in good time. thank you|Positive
I'm using this to fill an outdoor water trough for some small animals from a gravity fed supply line. Once mounted it has performing exactly as I needed it to. Every time I've checked it there's about an inch of water in my tiny trough. I'm not sure the variance, but there has always water there, so it's not a worry for me. It's been in use for several months now without an issue.|Positive
This product came in handy since I live in AZ and have only a swamp cooler. This portable unit was fantastic especially with the ice packs. I love it.|Positive
The reviews were really accurate and I am grateful....I purchased this to give me moisture and cooling at my summer job of being a fire lookout (fortunately I have electricity where I work) The tower is made of metal and can be 10 to 20 degrees hotter than outside temperature which take it sometimes to 100 inside. I have done this job for 32 years and the dry has taken its toll on my 70 year old body so moisture this summer has been really important....I truly love the feeling on my face and skin that this machine creates for me....to experience the coolness I place it 2 feet away from my body and listen to the waterfall aspect of it while feeling cooler moist air.....it makes my days so much better than ever before. If I had the money I would have purchased a larger one and chose this one because the ease of carrying it up 39 steps to the 14 by 14 cabin of the tower..... Next season I will get a larger one....I am pleased with the simplicity and ease of set up of this unit and would recommend it to anyone who wants to use it in a room within a house or insulated structure for cooling and moisture....my tower is not insulated and wall to wall windows so less viable for cooling yet wonderful for moisture.|Positive
I live in a dry climate so this actually does a decent job of keeping the house cooler than outside. Not A/C cool, but it's cheaper to buy and operation and it's quieter than A/C. The major downside is that it WILL EVENTUALLY LEAK. I had mine leak twice last summer and once so far this summer. And it will leak all the water it has left in the reservoir. I'm not sure what causes it, but I would have bought something different knowing what I know now.|Negative
This spring when I remove the cover, I will install a zipper on the open side so I do not have to cope with those rinky dink d-ring lacings. It looks as though the fabric in yours is far better than the old canvas ones.|Positive
Very noisy and not happy with the cooling from this cooler|Negative
great for small places, efficient and is very quiet. The cooling mechanism works quite well. It is perfect for an office.|Positive
We bought this product to help cool the basement when we had company over to do karaoke, This does the job and more. We were so happy we got another one for the bedroom so we didn't have to turn on the big unit. With Ice in the unit it is almost to cold when the fan is on high. Welove them.|Positive
Good sized pump.Good value. They generally last about two seasons. More so if you maintain them in good clean working order.|Positive
Like a previous review, will be helpful to apply on a day when there is no wind. It is a light shrink wrap product and near impossible to apply on a windy day. It does wrap nicely and stick to itself nicely to wrap and seal the outside of the swap cooler before you place the canvas cover.|Positive
worked well keeping 165 Sq ft cool as long as the outside temp was cooler than what you were trying to keep the room|Positive
"Paid $1000 for this to be installed. Worked fine for 12 months and 2 week. Then the fan stopped. Looked at it and the bushings, and they've disintegrated. Called Home Depot, ""Sorry, we don't service what we sell. Call Champion"" (ie: we don't stand behind the products we sell) Called Champion, ""Sorry, we don't honor anything after 12 months"" (ie: we don't stand behind the product we make and sell, after 12 months and 1 minute)"|Negative
Did as it's supposed to!|Positive
Works great on a 2400sq ft home . Double story. Knocked electric bill down as well|Positive
I will be returning the item. Too noisey to sleep while running. I am afraid I would forget the water.|Negative
"I love my Up-Dux! Now, I don't have to have the windows open to operate my evaporative cooler! Particularly good at night/overnight. Also, since I can keep the windows closed, I can have the EC operating while I am gone so I don't have to come up to a hot house. Cools off the attic too which I think keeps the house cooler longer when you turn the unit off. And since my water lines run through the attic it keeps my cold water tap a little cooler. Will have to do more attic venting if I get any more than the two I bought. Offhand it looks like a flimsy build (one unit I had to return because it was broken out of the box) but it is suitable for the task. Especially when you consider the fire draft closure mechanism built into it, it was worth the $50 I paid for each. Insert looks flimsy and cheap and there is no info in the instructions about it, but it slips in nicely and seems to work well. I will go up in the attic and cover the tops if I really want to insulate in the heating season. Keeping that cool air you are blowing out the windows on the premises (the attic) has got to be better than blowing it outside. Cons: - The vent lid is very light so heavy winds/attic drafts can make it bounce a little (with it bouncing on the weatherstripping, there is no noise) - so be careful on location selection - Doesn't seem to lower the house temp as much as I had hoped - just a degree or two. Does seem to ""even out"" the house temp more. (Not as big a temp difference in rooms.) Last words: On a hot day at 3 PM: Attic with no evaporative cooler running: 130 degrees Attic with evaporative cooler running: 115 degrees (EC ductwork cooling the attic) Attic with EC running and 2 Up-Dux: 90 degrees! The attic coolness has got to be good for the roof, too."|Positive
Worked as expected my swamp cooler is now operating.|Positive
I had to use some of the shims to fit my unit an they came included.|Positive
We had a floor cooler,then we got this cooler less than a month ago ( and besides it going down in price almost $50),the cooler is working very well,as long as it holds this working condition,we would recommend it.|Positive
YES! I wish I would of checked on what colors were available . VicTor|Positive
Installed 2 weeks to teplace 20 yr old Ultra cooler...its quiet works in our dry environment. Using a flush pump to send water to a garden area. Like a car to save the paint..I suggest you wax it when opening and/or shutting it down for the season. Only suggested upgrade to to have sheet metal insulated to assist keeping internal cabinet temps down. I personally did this with 1/4 inch glued foam board inside the old cooler...it appeared to help ..20 yrs... Overall nice product.|Positive
It works well in a garage but out doors it does not come close to the 750 square ft advertised.|Negative
This 6-position evaporative cooler wall switch is well constructed and easy to install. So far, it's working well and I've had it for several weeks now, using it every day. Good bargain!|Positive
I don't want to give away any secrets here, but I use these to cover my outdoor equipment, such as - string mowers, chipper/shredders, plate compactor, portable air compressor, chop saw (stored outside), battery chargers (stored outside), and the seat on my MF-30 tractor... I can buy lots of these for what it costs me to replace the seat.|Positive
I bought this because the vent could be changed to vertical. That saved me from removing the window completely. Once it was installed it turned out to be a life saver. We had another 2 weeks of 100 degree temps after install. It is much smaller than the old one, not as noisy and works better.|Positive
The old pump went out, so replaced with Maxcool pump. It works strong and much quieter to my enjoyment.|Positive
I expected much cooler air especially with water; however it's cooler than a fan. I used it outside.|Negative
This cover is a great buy. Fits perfectly. Will purchase in the future when needed.|Positive
"I""m very pleased whit this item"|Positive
Great product..we have used it inside and outside! Some might not like the level of noise but the payoff for being cool here in So. CA is worth it... Expecting to use it a lot in September! Heat wave coming! Thanks for the speedY delivery and easy pick up!|Positive
The belt was easy to install, and is working great.|Positive
The cover was more than expected. Good quality canvas,easy to install and secure to the cooler.|Positive
Perfect fit stops wind and cold weather from getting through!|Positive
This was to replace pads from an UltraCool swamp cooler. They are not the original size so you had to cut and paste them together. They original pads never flaked off but these were shedding from the moment I took them out of the box. they work but I was disappointed in the overall quality and application.|Negative
Standard installation|Positive
Out the box this thing looks nice. Loading water into the reservoir was very easy and held quite a bit of water. the controls were easy to use as well. Other than that this thing is complete junk. The fan was pathetic at best. All kidding aside I could blow harder than this thing. If your over two feet away you cant even feel the fan. The only thing this thing could cool is a 3x3 box ( on a good day) I give them two stars for effort and lost the three on the fan alone... Spend the extra money and buy one with a squirrel cage. For the sake of saying it.. the air does come out cool.. as expected from a typical swamp cooler but what are you going to do with cool air that comes out a 0 mph.|Negative
Replaced a similar model -different brand- that had been replaced last year. So far this works as intended. On the old one the drive shaft had rusted clean through, not connected at all, hope this one doesn't do that too...but it has a similar stainless shaft. I knew our Phx water was hard, but not toxic. Will be getting a filtration system soon.|Positive
Easy to connect to existing wiring out of my home and into the swap cooler to use for the water pump.|Positive
It's a really nice cooler. Easy to move from room to room and does a really good job at cooling the room. My living room is roughly 600sq and cools it quick and keeps it cool.|Positive
Works great if you are right in front of the cooler. Does not do real good for a large room. Not so happy with this product.|Negative
Says it's for 1600 sq. ft. home, but this thing keeps our 2000 sq. ft. home nice and cool, even the upstairs! The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the motor emits head/ear torturing hum, especially when on LO. I am going to contact the manufacturer to find out if this is normal or if I have a bad motor. It works, but the sound is so very annoying.|Positive
Very quiet pump with a good output.|Positive
Don't even bother with central air... My family and I are freezing with this Master cool unit. No I don't work for Master cool or Home Depot. I have not hooked up the thermostat yet, so it has been on low and is keeping my house at 61 degrees. Yes it's cold. It is also moist air not dry like central air. The unit does not freeze up like central air either. I am very impressed with the master cool unit.|Positive
Review Bonaire Durango 4500E, Purchased 5-27,15, SLC, UT Summary: Relatively easy to install. Much better than anticipated cooling. Quieter operation than expected. Almost free to purchase with Utah’s public utility rebate. I did a lot of research before making this purchase and landed on this style of cooler and model for four reasons: ease of self-installation, flexibility, cost of operation, public utility rebate. I compared it to a similar model at another box store and chose the Bonaire Brand because it received many more positive reviews and far fewer negative ones. A few specifics might be helpful: Evaporative coolers don’t work when it’s humid. If you are used to AC, this kind of cool air, with lots of moisture in it, will feel different and maybe not as cool. Since I was switching from a large AC window unit, I wasn’t sure if the cooler would ultimately be in the right place and that is why I chose a window unit as opposed to permanent. After a week, I doubt I will change its location because it is performing excellently, even at the opposite end of the house from where most of the living is done. Cost: This is probably a bit more expensive than a typical “box type/squirrel cage” evaporative cooler. But… our public utility is offering a significant rebate on “premium evaporative coolers” and since I installed this myself, after rebate, this will cost me very little. Installation: The installation instructions are straight-forward although they assume you live in a modern “builder” style home. If not, you’ll have to improvise. I have a late 1800s frame home with thicker walls. The cooler fit almost perfectly in my situation and only needed a 1” filler board outside. The inside window trim made the suggested bracket installation impossible so I created another solution. For lifting and leveling the cooler, you’ll need two people, and once it’s resting safely in the window opening, one person can finished the job. If you are lifting the unit into a higher window, as in my case, three would be better at least until you have the cooler through the window and resting on the sash. The third can help guide in the fan assembly and hold it in place and/or close the sash until you can attach it. Installation issues: I noticed a few things that may cause confusion: First, the cooler is shipped with the fan assembly not in the fully extended position, presumably to cut shipping dimensions and cost. This will require you to hand fit 9 screws, which is simple with one catch--pay close attention that you are getting the screw through both holes thereby connecting the two pieces. In a few spots on mine, on the first try, this did not happen and caused a slight bowing of the fan housing. In some cases the holes weren’t exactly aligned so I used a twist tie to run through both holes showing the proper screwing angle. I would definitely hand screw. Your electric driver won’t give you the feedback you need to see if both holes are penetrated and… could strip the plastic. Leveling: This is emphasized in the manual, but if it’s not obvious, if the cooler is not plumb and level, water may not drain over the pads uniformly and the effectiveness of the cooler will be reduced. In SLC, you want all the cooling power possible! Water pump: When I originally switched on the cooler for the first time, after letting the reservoir fill with water, the pump did not work. I read the manual, took off the back panel to see if the supply house had come loose from the water delivery tray, which it had not, and then restarted the cooler and it worked. In retrospect, this certainly was an issue of pump prime and nothing else. I drained the water as recommended after ten hours of use and experienced the same thing. I just shut down the cooler for a few seconds and turned it back on and the pump worked. If the pump is working, you will be able to hear falling water, see water trickling from the top of the pads and they will be uniformly moist. You will smell them for two days but… Water change: The instructions recommend changing the water twice, each time after ten hours of continuous use. Do it. You will notice, almost immediately, that the smell of the new pads goes away. With the water off, this will require that you unscrew the exterior nut of the overflow, push the overflow back into the cooler and let gravity do its thing. But… you’ll have a hard time getting the overflow tube back into the hole without removing the back cover, and in my case it’s trickier because it involves going up a ladder. So, I handled this issue on the second drain by making a long “S” hook with a smaller hook on one end and a larger on the other to grip and pull. I fed the smaller hook up into the overflow, next to the bleed off line, until it cleared the top then pulled it snug against the top of overflow. After the water drained, I simply tugged on the hook until about ¼” of the overflow extended from cooler housing, reattached the nut then retightened it, which drew out the overflow stem into the correct position. Much less work than taking off back panel. Especially six feet above ground. Cooling effectiveness and noise: Some have claimed that the cooler was neither as effective as they had hoped or made more noise than they expected. Regarding effectiveness: SLC, UT has been over 100 many times already this summer. My interior temp was 77 in the middle of my house and 78 at back on those days. My house is 2000 sq feet and I am only cooling the upstairs 1100 sq feet. The cooler is located at the front of the home, about 50 feet from the back where the main living space is. While the cooler is not in a direct line of site to the back of the house or bedroom, each of those rooms is only 1-2 degrees warmer, which seems remarkable seeing that there is 16 lineal feet of glass facing South or West at the back -- 50 feet from the cooler. Noisy: My experience does not bare this out. I tested the sound level on mine with a Radio Shack sound level meter, set to “A weighting”, the standard for sounds heard by the human ear, and got the following readings five feet to the side of the cooler: low cool 52 dB; medium cool 58 dB; high cool 64 dB. I doubled checked these numbers with a free app on my phone and turned in similar results. Sizing and venting: I learned that sizing and especially venting are crucial to how evaporative coolers work. Cooling power is determined in cfms, not btus like in AC. Sizing is determined by calculating cubic feet to be cooled divided by 2, ie: 1000 square feet with 8 foot ceilings would be: (1000*8)/2 or 4000 cfm. Regarding venting, evidently it’s the thing most people, including me, get wrong as it seems counter intuitive. The rule I found,and you can verify this by googling the topic, is 2 square feet of venting for each 1000 cfm of blower capacity. For this model that would be 9.8 square feet (I presume this is when cooler is on high)! I have spread the openings out over the rooms I want the most cooling in, and have used the flue in my wood burning also as a vent also. I have also been opening the cover to my attic space about 1 square foot and letting that help exhaust the hot air up there. And, after the sun goes down, I turn the blower on high, close up most of the house, and turn the cooler into an “attic fan”, so to speak, to help rid that blanket of hot air before the evening. Anecdotally, it seems much cooler! Finally, I called Bonaire’s customer support line and they were friendly, helpful and offered some good suggestions, like at the end of the season soaking the media in light vinegar water then rinsing to get scale off to prolong the life of the media. They also suggested a MaxCool Scale inhibitor, but I am skipping that for now to see how the pads do without help. I know this is a long review, but hopefully it was helpful.|Positive
This review is specific to the Hessaire 2,200 CFM 2-Speed Portable Evaporative Cooler for 750 sq. ft. Packaging/Unpacking: The unit came well packaged for shipment with good support using styrofoam blocking. However, the back panel of the unit was not correctly assembled which was easily fixed by removing the panel screws and re-seating it. Also one of the 16 screws used to attach the rolling castors had a damaged thread that I used regardless requiring extra effort to tighten. Initial Use: The unit has an initial strong smell associated with the new filter elements inside the unit. I found that by emptying the water reservoir after the first couple of uses resolved the problem to remove residual in the water. Hose Attachment: The unit attachment point is made of plastic, and the hose adapter is brass. Initially the connection worked fine filling the unit with water, however once the pressure increased as the flow was being stopped by the float assembly as the reservoir topped out in the unit, it started to drip. I didn't spend time to try and resolve it with either Teflon tape or even tightening the hose a bit more. You have to be careful with plastic parts. I may look at this issue further, but for now I always fill the unit through the front hinged panel from the hose. Usage: To date, I have only used the cooler on an open, but covered, back patio space. In temperatures up to 95 degrees (in the shade) so far, this cooler works wonders for comfort outdoors. I'm not one that particularly enjoys being confined inside during the long months of Phoenix heat. Of note using the cooler outside in this fashion, if it is breezy or windy, the cooling airflow may be pushed aside or minimized. In these situations, I normally have to roll the cooler closer or begin using one of the noisier higher fan speeds. I do intend on using this unit in a 2-3 car garage working on my vehicles. Based on the results so far on the patio, I don't expect any difficulties keeping the space cool and comfortable. Fan Noise: I had hoped for a slightly quieter fan - especially on the LOW setting. I find myself having to place the unit at least 10+ feet away on LOW to keep the noise satisfactory in an open patio setting where you might want to read or have normal conversation. Some will say this really isn't a problem for them, but I would have liked Hessaire to have adjusted for a slower fan speed on LOW to reduce the sound. Conclusion: This is really a great unit and has served me well in the dry Phoenix heat. No buyer's remorse here. It's great to be sitting outside cool and comfortable in the Phoenix heat of day on the back patio. The real test, I suppose, will be to see how it performs when the outside temperatures run 110+.|Positive
Nice solid product. Fit's nice and looks good.|Positive
Was cut a little short,, but serviceable.|Positive
I love my new evaporative cooler! My handyman installed it yesterday, and it immediately began to cool my 737 sq. ft. house. It makes a whooshing noise as the air flows through it, but it's not annoying, at all. It took JH 1 hr 45 min for installation---from the time he dismantled the old one to the time he handed me the bill. He was able to install it w/o help. The cooler is suspended from two chains near my back porch, as the old one was. The front portion enters the house from an opening in the wall of the laundry room. The air control consists of a dial which is easy to turn.|Positive
Compared to a similar unit that was purchased 5 years ago, this unit's quality has gone down. One nut had come loose and fallen out, a bolt was missing and shipping screws leave holes in the unit that are potential rust spots. Louvers are hard to remove and reinstall, electrical connection panel is held on with two screws. There are four holes but only two screws were supplied. If the unit wasn't up on my roof, I would have taken it back and demanded a refund. Overall, if I replace another swamp cooler, I will look for a better built unit.|Negative
This unit is woth five stars, at least from having used it only one month so far. The design is crisp and clean, the pads are easy to get to as the three side panels come off by easily lifting them out of their mounting channels, the louvers are aesthetically pleasing and variable, and the unit is pleasingly quiet. The one tiny thing to complain about is that there is no provision for the electrical cord to exit from inside the vent/control panel. I cut a notch in its plastic housing in a convenient place to bring it out.|Positive
Did the job, won’t know how well they hold out for a few years, but they fit well.|Positive
This pump has been in my swamp cooler since I bought my house 8 years ago. Just recently it quit working as well and I discovered that the little white part that goes on the very bottom had part of a tab break off (so it doesn't stay on snug, and thus doesn't pump water effectively. I can rig something to hold it on but was here checking in case they sold the part separately and decided to write a review. Seems like a good pump overall and I would get the same one again.|Positive
The only draw back is that it should have been shipped with about 2Ft. of plumbers strap to secure it to the unit. The unit that it is used in is in an auto repair shop, so the unit is moved around every now and then. Without the strap, the pump would tip over.|Positive
Side was dented in shipping. Top was warped but not corrected during installation|Negative
Went into the Eastvalle store looking everywhere for one of the 12 they had in stock. Finally found someone who knows where it MIGHT BE. After a couple hours of 2 men locating it, being a seasonal item we found this $12 item. An absolute life saver for my aircompresser I NEEDED running that night!|Positive
One star for false advertisement. This cooler is a fine indoor machine and has been a good one for a few years.. but suddenly they are claiming double the CFM to 2100... not so fast Hessaire. the Hessaire website calls out the cooler at 1100 CFM in both the old MBC2000 model and the new MC21 model .which is correct. So why are they claiming 2100 and 700... your guess is as good as mine but buyer beware. Use the cooler indoors and for about 400 feet....|Negative
This product comes in pieces, when the original pads was one piece. I did not like the middle pads, I prefer one piece. Makes life easy. The side pads fit perfect.|Negative
I feel the seal in these units are made of inferior Chinise rubber .The seal is what allways goes bad. WHERE CAN I GET THE SEALS ? They are easy to replace .|Negative
Cools an 800 square-feet shop in the Arizona desert with no problem. Keeps indoor temp 10 to 20 degrees cooler than the outside temp and helps raise humidity level from single digits to 50-60%. Just what I needed!!|Positive
We have no AC, so the summers can be brutally hot! This unit keeps our upstairs very cool and because it moistens the air as it cools, it helps emensly with my allergies. Its a great investmet! If you need to keep an area of your home cool, like an Arizona room if you have one of those, this thing will do the job!! I'm very pleased with mine!|Positive
Could not cool a small bedroom. I understand it's not an air conditioner and that moisture is added to the air but it made the room hot and humid. We tried everything we could think of to get it to work thinking maybe we were doing something wrong. The woman working the return counter laughed about how many she has seen brought back (12 in one week!!!) because they simply do not work. I wish I would have read reviews before purchasing, hopefully someone will read this and learn from my mistake. We switched to a more expensive portable AC unit and couldn't be happier, it's worth every penny. Maybe Home Depot should do the right thing and stop carrying this product!|Negative
Not working as well as I expected. But in all fairness I am still playing with how far to open the windows to vent it. It is suppose to cool up to 1600 sq ft. I only have 1358 sq ft. and it is doing ok on low. May end up having to run it on high. Be sure you know if the rating is for high or low before you buy.|Negative
The Motor was easy to install. The wiring instructions were simple and easy to follow. Installation was simple.|Positive
Great for cooling down a room! And fantastic for cuddling with on a super duper hot day.|Positive
Fit perfectly on my slim profile Bonaire cooler|Positive
Fit was perfect and very heavy duty.|Positive
Its a good evaporative cooler fan. Use it in my kids room to keep temp down a bit. Don't try to cool more than one room with it, and don't rely on the ice packs provided with the cooler. Either buy some better ones in the camping section at Walmart or just use water bottles filled and frozen in the freezer. Works great for bedtime!|Positive
The cooler was easily installed, an affordable price, low noise, and no rust to worry about. Great all round value.|Positive
im not going to do this because i am forced to write 50 caracters so im just going to type until i think i reached 50. next time i will not rate is i this is a requied filed.|Positive
This was exceptional in fabric and style. Went over the old swamp coolers wih ease and fastened perfectly. Would recommend this to anyone needing a cover.|Positive
Easy to assemble, fill and move around. Wish unit was taller. We’re using it in the bedrooms and even with adjustable blade direction it blows directly into the bed, not above it, so we can’t feel it. Considering putting it on top of a platform to raise the fan portion so we feel the air.|Positive
I bought this unit thinking it would be more advanced than older style coolers but I was wrong. I have had swamp coolers for over 40 years and this unit has under-sized cooling pads that are overwhelmed by the fan air flow. Forget about putting it on high because of the noise and further overwhelming of the small pad area. I live in vegas and the unit I replaced would cool the house to 74 when it was 108 and 10% humidity. This unit barely holds at 80 under the same outdoor conditions. I will have to go back to the old style unit so I wasted $550. One other thing. The older style units allow you to double up the pads which really increased its efficiency, but you can't do that with this unit.|Negative
The straps went about one and three quarters around the coolers, twice would have been better. I was left with long leftovers.|Negative
I bought 3 of them works great in arizona weather . when the climate is dry .|Positive
Because it does not cool a room like it said it works in tiny rooms i bought 2 not happy sorry|Negative
Exact replacement part, though a little expensive.|Positive
Fits perfectly.|Positive
"I bought this unit last year to replace an old Phoenix MFG unit that was 15 years old and rusted beyond belief. This unit was pretty much a direct swap; only needed to buy the universal leg kit and lag screws to mount it to my roof (the previous installers on the old unit mickey-moused the mounting with angle iron and scrap metal). What I did like about the cooler is flexibility to install your electrical and water line on any side of the cooler. So far it has worked very well into its second summer in service. Now for the reasons why I knocked a star off on quality: First, the electrical knockouts were poorly done; I had to use a step drill and grinder to open up the hole to install my wiring. I couldn't simply use a hammer/punch. Second, one of the pillow block bearings leak out all the oil whenever I fill up the oil reservoir. It's been fine for almost two years, but I plan to replace it when I winterize for this year. Third, last year one of the links on the brackets that hold the pads in place broke off. Will also replace this year. Fourth, the pump that comes with the unit seized on me when I replaced the pads last night. I took the pump apart to see why and it looks like the bearings seized. It was not a result of aspen debris jamming the impeller. Also the pump does not have a ""pre-screen"" built into it like the Dial MFG pumps do, thus allowing debris that gets past the pump basket to be pumped to the spider, thereby clogging it. I purchased a Dial MFG tan pump (up to 7000 CFM rating) and the cooler works great again. It doesn't install into the cooler's bracket, so I placed it in the ""front"" of the cooler along with my purge pump and it fits there well, right next to the float. But all in all, the chassis appears to be well-built and all of the common universal cooler items that you can buy will fit. Despite these small hiccups, for the price of this unit I have been happy with my purchase as it keeps our house nice and cool, even during the muggy times in August. When the hot Santa Ana winds hit, that's when this unit shines!"|Positive
this pump is okay i run it all day every day except a night it isn't used at much i had it for two months or three months and it finally froze up i am guessing maybe if i would of oiled it at least once a month maybe it would of lasted longer i will be purchasing another one because the last one lasted for a long time due to it being used all day every day so ya its up to the next person to try it and leave another review wish there were more reviews so i could have a better analysis of this product. o says something about a warranty so next time i will be keeping the paper for it and the receipt.|Positive
works good|Positive
I live in New Mexico, a good climate for a swamp cooler. This cooler was able to bring the temp down by about 15 degrees in my large back bedroom. So from 95+ degrees to 80 degrees. Basically the difference between unbearable and bearable. It holds two buckets of water and can run for 8 hours without needing a refill. I would recommend this if you have realistic expectations. By the way, instructions were in Chinese (I think!) so I had to download English ones off the internet.|Positive
I don't know how old my swamp cooler is. It's all metal and old! The pump went out in it I was surprised to find another pump that , was available, and fit. Hook up took about ten minutes. It works like a charm.|Positive
The overall Bonaire window evap cooler is great with 2 exceptions - The on-off selector knob has broken twice at $30 each. Home depot stocks this cooler but not the pump or repair parts. Our pump failed in a heat wave and we waited 1 week for delivery despite misleading on-lines notes that some stores may have the part. I'm a sucker, so rather than calling, I visited the 4 stores in our area and none had any parts. 1 week later it arrived.|Negative
Ordered this 4L350 on suggestion of site as direct replacement. Item was wrong belt. Took too long to get in first place. Mower was down so I went to a local dealer,paid more but got exact fit.|Negative
I love this product! The fan works amazingly at keeping our room cool. I love how it has three settings and even slats that circulate the air. If we want our room super cool, we just use the AC option and it works wonderfully! I love how light weight it is so its super easy to transport from room to room!|Positive
Unit is very good for enclosed areas|Positive
Easy to install, more easy to use. Simple instructions for both installation and use.|Positive
It was the right size, I just wish I could have brought it in the store|Positive
Only some of them was the right size 3 were way small|Negative
Very good product to beat the heat, I set the water on the lower level or it takes up too much water during the day. Does a great job of cooling the living and dining rooms. I place it in front of the balcony screen door and it works well. The ice function really helps to drop the temperature.|Positive
This motor has a horrible hum to it that resonates in the squirrel cage and is unbearable!! I took one motor back after only an hours use for a replacement... well, the replacement is exactly the same. These are NOT quiet motors and for near $100 I expected much-much better. I had to reinstall my 2 speed motor where the high doesn't work to have some sort of cooling while I go to a competitor for a efficient and QUIET motor.|Negative
The hard wheels don't roll well on uneven surfaces should have a little larger wheels.|Negative
Was glad to find this product, perfect size for the dog kennel.|Positive
I would recommend this evaporative cooler. I've only been using it for about a month but have had no problems so far. It's quiet and cools my house on the low setting. Installing it wasn't hard. It doesn't come with the hose adapter fyi. One of the water distributor tubes was broken when I got it delivered. I ordered it online.|Positive
Made well, nice fabric. Easy installation. Looking forward to see how well they hold up during the winter season.|Positive
It works well if you have it facing you from a 5-8 feet distance. I've replaced my fan for this and you can feel the cool air. Great product and price.|Positive
Great product. Fit was just right. Tightens with a set screw and not one of the square headed screws like on the squirrel cage.|Positive
5 star|Positive
Excellent cooler. I have the Champion WCM 28. I used this for my class A motorhome when the blower motor for my rooftop air conditioner went out in the summer heat of Southern Nevada. I have a senior citizen mother and a small dog to care for so keeping cool was very important. With this cooler just walking in the door from outside it’s like walking into a refrigerator. It cools all three rooms in motorhome exceptionally well. This cooler will completely chill you. It puts out absolutely cold air. Easy to setup and very easy to use. Only requires very basic plumbing skills. This product is of very good quality. With proper care I can tell it will keep me comfortably cool in the southwestern heat for many years to come. It’s ability to completely displace the heat is amazing. Since we can end up using AC year round in Southern Nevada, the Champion coolers are a wonderful energy saving alternative. But don’t forget to oil the motor once a year. I would definitely recommend this product. The only drawback is the back louverd cover can be difficult to get on and off and the screws for the water spider can be cheap causing the spider to come lose, so I use better quality screws to keep the spider firmly in place. Otherwise a very good product.|Positive
Cheap parts, noisy, and does not even cool our 250 sqr foot bedroom. It leaked water from the drain plug..and when tightened the plastic nut broke! I would not recommend this unit and will be returning it after only 2-days!|Negative
Worked good, it’s nice to install on something that has the same threads as a garden hose, like off of a washer for cloths.|Positive
I did not notice and signifcant change in room tempture even when ICE was added to enhance the coolnest. Also the product was extremely noisey. I would not recommend this item to anyone.|Negative
It works very well|Positive
I purchased this for my bedroom. It is too loud, smells, and does not cool very well. The fan is weak and the back is difficult to snap back on. It would probably work better in a bathroom or a closet. I wasn't expecting AC results, but this isn't even comparable to a swamp cooler. There was no display unit at the store so I had to buy one to find out. They will have a display unit after I return this tonight!|Negative
The new pads fit fine but the odor has run me out of the house. I've seen a couple of reviews saying that the wet glue in the pads is the cause of the odor. Buyer beware, the odor does not dissipate quickly.|Negative
In the past I have always purchased the closest size available at the my local store. This new cover fits perfectly and seems to be of veryy good as well. I glad I took the time to order this product.|Positive
Don't waste your money! Third time I removed the reservoir the pump fell to the bottom of the unit. Now the pump is not working! Not worth the effort to take back to Home Depot. I should have read the reviews closer before I purchased this product.|Negative
I was looking for the next bigger size width wise these appear weak.|Negative
They worked great, right size, do the job|Positive
It worked and fit perfectly when I installed it in my e-vap cooler|Positive
we love to order these pads as they fit the unit just right, instead of having to cut them to put them in.|Positive
its noisy and doesn't seem to cool down my bedroom as good as my ole room swamp cooler, got this one because my old one cracked plastic and leaked on floor, only seems to drop by 10 degrees at best.. Wouldn't buy again.|Negative
It fit perfectly! snapped right on with no hassle. Highly recommend this cover|Positive
I'm using this air cooler in my rental property in Los Angeles, California. It's a 1920's building without modern air conditioning. This evaporative air cooler works great but it sure does use a lot of water. In Los Angeles, where water conservation is very important, I'm hesitant to use it all day every day. I only use it at night when I'm sleeping or when I have people visiting. It starts working quickly and can cool my bedroom in about an hour. It's an attractive unit but it is large and takes up a decent amount of space. It's very quiet on the lowest setting. Set up was easy and the instructions were clear.|Positive
The MC11000 swamp cooler pumps do not last long enough. Either do the other models of swamp cooler pumps.|Negative
I was pleased with this purchase for about 4 days. Then it started to leak water on a major scale out of the rear vents. I returned it to the retailer who was very good in quickly replacing it without argument or hassle.The replacement worked for about 6 weeks then it also started leaking water big time from the same rear venting.Tomorrow I will be re- contacting the retailer but will no longer be interested in a replacement item. Four letters:to describe this product: J-U-N-K.|Negative
Bought this because it is so hot and humid on our patio (south Florida) during the summer that you can’t sit out there at all. We fill it with ice water and keep it on low or medium and can actually sit out there at night and enjoy. It can go about 6 hours on low without refilling. So far we love it!|Positive
For such a small little unit, it sure puts out the cool air…perfect for what i needed...|Positive
both have failed returning them this week|Negative
replacement belt. good product.|Positive
Not what I expected or read about. Sleeping with this in my room gave me bronchitis and a double ear infection. Plus made my room feel like an actual swap|Negative
We were pleasantly surprised at how well this product worked. We have one office that for some reason stays hot no matter what. Bought this product with the hopes it may help and boy has it. The office is now comfortable for the person to work in.|Positive
"This unit works decently as a plain old fan, but it DOES NOT ""cool"" adequately (or as advertised)! I have a very small 100 sq ft office space, and there is almost NO DIFFERENCE between the regular fan setting and the ""cooling fan"" setting. I have put ice packs and ice cubes in the water chamber and it makes almost no difference. I am not in a humid environment (I know this can limit the unit's effectiveness), so there is no explanation for this disappointing performance. I could have bought a much cheaper unit if I was only buying a simple fan... *sigh*!"|Negative
I expected better performance and less noise when running. In addition, the smell of wet cardboard became nauseating. Returned item|Negative
As other reviews said, the sponge (wet part) smells funny for about 4 hours on first use - we just aimed it outside instead of inside. The air out is about 15-20 deg F cooler than the intake air on low fan speed. Pore size is about 4mm x 4mm. Fan speed is pretty fast - cools very well.|Positive
This felt like a good quality cover, but the seams ripped immediately as I cinched the cord. I wasn't going to spend time returning it, buying a new one, and then getting up on the roof again, so I left it. Needless to say, I'm disappointed in the poor quality seams.|Negative
Very easy to install. Came with everything needed except waterline and window blocking Anybody charging more for a similar product is taking you for a ride My client is very pleased and called me to come over and pay me Does get better than that|Positive
Works well,good size but had to buy parts for it other than that it's good!!!|Positive
Unit works excellent. Assembled it and put it to use right away, everything we expected.|Positive
the cooler drops the temp in my 1500 SF home by about 20 degrees--(95 to 75 degrees at 2800 ft elevation in the Sierras) It makes very little noise for the amount of air it moves|Positive
It was exactly the right part and installed easily. Arrived in a few days after order. With the low humidity right now, my garage is actually cooler than my house.|Positive
The company that makes these has not changed the design in many years, for the simple reason that it works and doesn’t need to be changed. My only comment is to tell the mfg. to upgrade the pads other modern stuff that flows better and is more efficient in transferring heat. I never use the pads th|Positive
Easy to put on and look much better than black trash bags and duct tape....lol|Positive
The cooler was easy to get working as there is almost no assembly required. However, it just doesn't cool well, even with the two icepacks provided. I found that regular ice works far better, but even that melts in a short period and you're left with something akin to a glorified fan. Maybe this works for really small spaces but it didn't even cool my bedroom and it's not very big - fits a bed and a dresser. I returned it and purchased an actual AC unit - something that actually cools.|Negative
the pads worked great ...but i need the knob for turning the unit on. the plastic broke and i am using pliers which will degrade the switch can you provide a solution? PLEASE provide a solution|Positive
Works well for the money.|Positive
This is my second Luma Comfort cooler, I use in my green house powered by solar panels and pure sign wave inverter. Low power usage allows this. In hot dry climate of eastern Oregon this is perfect.|Positive
Good product, enough air flow may be need to increase the cooling material for a better cooling air|Positive
This is absolutely amazing and keeps my small bedroom cool. I bought this product to be able to sleep during the hot months and stay cool. I give it 4 stars because it leaks on the cold setting for a short moment after you put the cold ice pack or ice in. It's the only issue but not a big one. It doesnt leak for long and stops after a bit. Over all I am very happy with this product, its powerful. Keeps the room cool at night to sleep and added bonus cancels out sound in my apartment complex.|Positive
Unit shut off at random intervals of 5 - 45 minutes. Did not [rovide ANY cooling even with ice in the water and top compartment. I returned it for a refund|Negative
Had it a couple of weeks, overall happy with it. If it is humid, like any swamp cooler, it does not do such a great job, but in our dry climate it does quite well. We use it in the bedroom for night time use, it of course has a 'fan' noise but it becomes white noise. I would buy this again.|Positive
using it to cover my dogs duck blind stand to keep her out of the rain while duckhunting...painted it camo. She's 11 years old and still likes to hunt.|Positive
This air cooler is on wheels so is very easy to move from place to place. I have used in the garage and on a covered patio, and really does make a difference in the temperature of the air. The fan alone, without water, is pretty amazing. Overall, a very good purchase.|Positive
My old cooler was still good to run but all the side panels were broken into many pieces due to rust when I did the maintenance in winter. Replacing all 4 panels will cost almost the same as buy a whole new cooler so I decided to order a new one from Home Depot as they had the cheapest price for this unit when I searched online, The unit came after a week and the delivery man was very helpful, he helped me to take it to the back of the home where I could bring it to the roof. This unit is quite heavy so you need at least 2 more men to bring it to the roof. When it was already sit on the roof jack you can handle the rest by yourself. Connecting the motor, water pump and water line were easy even it was the first time I did it. You may need other parts from Home Depot, depending conditions of your unit. In my case , I need both: --DIAL 18 in. x 18 in. Evaporative Cooler Roof Jack Model # 78317 --DIAL 3-1/2 in. 30 in. Evaporative Cooler Round-Corner Leg Kit, Model # 7805 The duct of this unit is 17.5 x 17.5 so this roof jack is perfect but one opening side between the duct and bottom pan is too small, you have to bend the roof jack so the unit can sit on top of the roof jack. Be careful on this side when secure the metal duct to the roof jack as the screw might puncture the bottom pan as I did. The 3 other sides are OK as the distance between metal duct and bottom pan are more than 3 inches. The roof jack should be secured to the roof first before letting the cooler sit on it. I did later so the job is harder as I didn't have much space to do it. Anyway, it was a good experience to do the installation by myself even it was the first time and I really want to share. The cooler runs perfectly to cool the house in hot days. Recommended to everyone.|Positive
I bought one last year and it broke just outside of the 1 year warranty. I couldn't find another another one local so I took a chance. The new one leaked wise than my old one. I expected a lot more for the amount I paid. Calling this piece trash is insulting the trash it's so bad. If I could give it negative stars I would. I taking it back and voicing my opinion to the local store as well|Negative
I thought it might be overkill for my shop but it isn't. It cools very well with one drawback, the smell is bad. It has gotten better and it's only been in service for 1 week, hopefully it will improve.|Positive
Works as advertised. Here in South Texas, the humidity is still rather high so the actual cooling differential isn't too great. I measured about a 6 degree drop in temperature from the intake to blower side of the unit on a hot day in July. The blower is quiet enough and works well. So, all in all, it does help move air and it does drop the temperature a bit on a hot day.|Positive
Well I have 48 apartments have swamp coolers on them and I've been using those motors for about 6 years now and maybe I lose about 10 motors a year that don't last more than a year burn up and get hot I buy pout 15 new ones a year that's not good odds when you consider 10 of them burn up in a year|Negative
Delivery was fast. Installation was good. Works well.|Positive
This product is great because it keeps the house cool, and it's not too loud.|Positive
The snap on cover is so convenient and effective at keeping out unwanted airflow when the cooler is not in use. Love it!|Positive
These are good quality pads.|Positive
Since this uses water as the cooling agent, a person with any brains would realize that it should be painted with rust inhibitive primer, then a rust inhibitive paint....... BUT IT'S NOT. EVERY part is metal, which rusts. The screws are the first to go. Then the very thin supports for the upper frame. This thing rusted out so fast it was astonishing. The next time I buy one I will primer the entire thing with Zinsser rust inhibitor primer, then coat it with Rustoleum rust inhibitor paint. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE FACTORY.|Negative
"Live in AZ and use water coolers a lot at the River. Have a 5th wheel on Daughters property in dessert of Ca. Needed a cooler to keep the cost of electric down. tried 2 of the So Called ""Good Ones"" that were trash. Found this 1, read the reviews, seen the price (Which was cheaper than the other 2) and decided to try it. Picked it up today put it in the 5th wheel with 1 window and 2 doors open (Its 98 outside) AND COLD IN HERE AT 74. You really need to try this. I'm glad I did and I'm getting another for my patio in AZ! I'm sold! BK"|Positive
This cover did not fit my cooler, a WCM28. It does not have a cover available. I called the company. You are the only one who has it listed as being for the WCM28. You need to remove it from the website.|Negative
We were worried that it would be too small for our home. It cools our 1050 Sq ft home with no problem. We haven't gotten to the hottest part of the year yet, but so far so good.|Positive
Was no cooler than a regular fan, even with the ice pack in the water receptical|Negative
I used the cooler as directed: in a dry desert climate, using ice water. The room started at at 82 degrees, but never got below 78 degrees using the cooler. It seemed like it was just a fan and not a cooler. Will be returning for a refund.|Negative
Thus far it met the criteria of covering what it says it will cover. Time will tell how it does in weather but if you are looking to winterize your Bonair window unit this absolutely covers it.|Positive
Had low price pads in swamp cooler struggled to reach 78 degrees @84 outside, on high fan. Frustrated, ordered Champion 3 pad pack online. Came in days earlier than projected, customer service was great, much smaller package, CS opened up to find them folded in half. Perfect size, no cutting. 91 degrees outside & 2 hours later 71 inside, on low! Only brand I'll ever buy only @ Home Depot.|Positive
Just what you would expect from a fancy fan that makes your room humid.|Negative
as of right now it seems to be operating as it should, i thought the product was highly priced for what it is.|Negative
Fits perfectly keeps cold air out.|Positive
We purchased this cooler for our screened in porch and it lowers the temperature about 10 degrees. This allows us to use our porch on hotter days. It is a great product at a reasonable price.|Positive
Good fit, stopped all the cold air from coming in.|Positive
Worked for what I needed. Cut to size and attached over intake vents to help cool a shed housing appliances by wetting down pads during heat of the day.|Positive
I love my Artic Air! It produces just enough moisture to keep me from sufficating from the dry desert night air!|Positive
June 4 High Desert California 99 degrees outside, this thing is cooling me off in my home office area and it's sitting 18' away in living room! 2 or 3 times the effective cooling air over my Arctic Cove 700 which I'm throwing out tomorrow. 'nuff said?' I'm buying another for bedroom!|Positive
I've had the evaporative cooler for a month. I use it 5 days a week. It does what a evaporative cooler is supposed to do. Very happy with the cooler. Drain the water tank after the first day of use. Cellulose material cuttings will wash off the new pads and might stop up the water pump.|Positive
This is a very strong blowing cooler , and the fact that it’s a swamp cooler as well is an added plus , waiting for it to go on sale is the best way to add this appliance to your home. Excellent purchase for the money!|Positive
Love it! Purchased for my mom and like it so much I think I am going to order one as well. :O)|Positive
Wow!! This easy to move portable device has helped us to keep one area of our house cool when it goes over 90 F. I love this machine. Would highly recommend!|Positive
First look at this pump is good. The volume seems to be adequate for a large cooler. Time will tell if it has longevity that is expected from a commercial related pump for continuous use.|Negative
Cools quickly and quietly. Easy to use ,moves easily around the house.diffinetly worth the money.|Positive
Drop in replacement motor...wasy to install and get back up and running!|Positive
Easy to install. More cooling than I need in a small house. More than 20 degrees cooling on dry hot days. I have two suggestions: Add a timer, and have a lower speed. Low speed on my unit is still too much! These have become very popular... for good reason!|Positive
Works quite well, cools a room quickly and efficiently. Doesn't require a tube connection to a window, so is more portable than a portable a/c unit. Only caveat is that it cools via evaporation of water, so relative humidity must be low (at least 50% or less), or you'll only get a more humid, not cooler, room. Well suited for the desert southwest, not so much Florida or the Gulf Coast!|Positive
Very durable material, fit perfectly.|Positive
Nice|Positive
The tie or cord around the bottom is a bit flimsy but it fit. Our cooler has electrical line that causes a problem getting it down all the way around.|Negative
Was easy to install and fits perfectly. The swamp cooler is very old and it's very hot in my area, but with the new pads and water pump, it seems to alleviate the heat a bit.|Positive
Air flow was great, easy assembly. Good capacity reservoir. Size is bit bulky, but otherwise great product. After using for 7 days machine began squealing after being on for an hour, slightly at first then louder. I shut down, then turned of a couple hours and turned on. in about one hour began a slight squeal then louder. I returned the item. The customer service desk was very efficient in the handling the return. I would probably try a different model now.|Positive
Was a very good purchase. Great value works great.|Positive
Great that you had the product and delivered it to our house to keep our cooler maintained properly.|Positive
So far so good House is cool.|Positive
Was really pleased with this product . Runs a little loud.|Positive
Will it help cool your house? Yes it will. Is it easy to install? Yes, if all the hardware is still attached. Is it high quality? Nope. The metal on these units will ding, bend, scratch, scuff, and drop a screw if you so much as sneeze next to it! Be sure to buy extra screws and bolts with thicker threads and i'd highley recommend using bolts with washer and backer nut where possible. The metal is thin and flimsy. If you are not concerned about appearance, and just functionality, this is a great purchase, and lets face it, the whole reason you would be buying an evap cooler is to cool - not stare at! It looked to be a nice solid piece of equipment at the store, but that was just its nice paint job, which comes off quicker than i would have expected. The venting along the filter doors is really flimsy and if the utmost care is not taken, they will dent very quickly. Just be careful when handling.|Negative
Fit great and are name brand pads for a great price|Positive
Easy to install. Quiet operation. Keeps the room cool.|Positive
Does not cool as large an area as described. Very noisy.|Negative
Pretty much what you'd expect. 34x34x36 fit our 34x34 cooler with with a enough slack as needed to go over connections. Canvas looks and smells like it's been spray painted with latex paint, which adds body to the fabric and helps improve is longevity and resistance to UV.|Positive
We purchased the cover to use on our house outside a/c unit. It fits very well and is a nice product.|Positive
works well easy to install|Positive
OK... So the price is high... I dont care what anybody says, until you've actually had one and used it like me you can never have a clue. Mine has a one hp motor in it a bit beefed up and a 11000 water pump. I used to live in the So. Cal high desert now Im back in the stockton Valley again and my garage willo have one and my house will have the newer one Im buying this week.|Positive
Product would look best and be easiest to install on a wide completely flat window sill. But, it can probably be made to work in about any window large enough for the duct and with clearance for the unit itself. After installation my unit did not function properly. The fan blew but there was no water distribution. Upon removal of the housing and pads, I found the pump cover was not properly installed and was interfering with the pump cooling fan. After correcting this, and vaccuming out all the pad debris in the water tray in the bottom of the unit, I reassembled it and it functioned fine. One improvement would be if the air could be directed in more directions. The only options are straight fwd or half straight, to the left or closed and the other half straight, to the right or closed. I wish I could direct all the air to the left or right or up or down. Oh well. I would not consider replacing with another swamp cooler. This one is fine - better than our old one which rusted out after 15 or 20 years, with zero maintenance, at least from an apparent design, simplicity standpoint. I may feel differently if this one doesn't last at least 10 years.|Positive
These media pads are a great fit and do a great job!|Positive
It was dented, the parts were NOT flush and it was BROKE on the front plastic. Just with I could have included ALL the pictures I have.|Negative
Fit the cooler just right. Looks okay|Positive
Very easy set up. I am very happy with this product, and would recommend it without hesitation.|Positive
We could only find this product at Home Depot and your customer service people were excellent.|Positive
It cools the house fast. It makes the air inside very comfortable and pleasant. We love the options and the adjustments.|Positive
I built a fountain three years ago that depends on a float valve to keep the reservoir from overfilling. (Because Houston is so humid, no one sells any parts for an evaporative cooler -- they don't work here,) There was no choice but to find it online. My previous one was made of nylon and broke, so i made sure this one was made of brass. My Home Depot is about six miles away and I arranged to pick up the valve there. I was very impressed with how fast and easy the whole transaction had been, from ordering to pickup. Installation of the valve only took about ten minutes. (BTW, the water line is a refrigerator ice maker line hooked up to an outside faucet.)|Positive
Had this installed in our rental property Swamp cooler unit. Easy to replace. Works great.|Positive
Evaporative cooling is best utilized in an area where there's no humidity. If you have humidity the machine has limited cooling capability, although it does provide a nice cool breeze on a warm day.|Positive
This item has a very weak fan . Very little air coming out of unit . I would not reccomend this item to anyone.|Negative
We have a lot of poker nights on our backyard patio. The portacool is very easy to install and does not take up too much space. This cooled the backyard and slept everyone cool all night. Love this machine.|Positive
I has use all kinds of coolers, but this one is all some|Positive
Same unit but comes with a drain pump and duct cover (not sure on price difference). It has a seperate pump for just draining the unit instead of a siphon. The drain pump is programable to come on for 5 mins every 2,4,6 or 8 hours. This means the unit can use less water but still cycles out old water for fresh water when the drain pump comes on. It runs a tube to a fitting on the side of the unit, attach a PVC pipe or garden hose to drain down and away from house. The duct cover is nice also, its a plasic molded cover that clips and fits over the front of the air duct (snap it on inside the house to cover the duct for winter weatherization) Ths unit is loud even on the low setting but I dont think I have ever known of any A/C or Evap cooler that wasnt loud. It sure works good and blows hard on even the low fan setting. This unit is installed in my dinning room window thats attached to a large den area. Those rooms are down a short hall and seperate from my living room. This unit cools the dinning room, large den and blows air down the hall to the living room. Im shocked at how well this little unit works. Saves me from having to turn on our expensive A/C durring the day when all I need is the main areas cool.|Positive
This fit and worked great !!|Positive
Set up was easy. The ocillating blades are hitting something inside making a noise so people are really not using it. I need to open it up to resolve the noise then it should be fine. It did run for a bit before the noise and it cooled the area considerably and for the output the fan noise was not too bad.|Negative
This is ok.. blows cool air.. But doesn't cool whole room..|Negative
Does not work under correct humidity levels. On my way to returning this device. Pump works, pad is wet and fan is working but the air coming out is no different than air coming out of a fan, it's essentially a $200 fan.|Negative
great product. Used on a camping trip to cool a tent and worked great. Also i use this to cool down on my back porch prior to going into AC.|Positive
We are in an RV and with this Texas summer heat I do not how we would manage withour our NewAir AF=310 Electric Tower Fan ..WE have 2 of them .. We love them ..The noise is low and we use the coolair and this makes our summers most tolerable.We have recommended this product to many people and will continue to do so. Thank You for NewAir.|Positive
this cooler does a great job we have only had to use it on low speed and it makes the house very comfortable|Positive

Functioned exactly as expected. Moves a lot of water, and quiet.|Positive
Worked just like they should.|Positive
Better than the last cooler we had here at our shop for the price.|Positive
Love this cooler. Works great. Would recommend to others.|Positive
Easy to install. Fit like a glove. No more untidy blue tarp flapping in the wind|Positive
Information on how tight they fit. Would have been useful. I probably could have gone with 34 in. In particular the down direction as I had to fold it up off the roof and put a strap around it. But it looks good and the straps seem to be doing their job in the wind. It's only been up a couple weeks but so far so good.|Positive
It works, it pumps water. Will it go bad in six months like the last one did? Only time will tell.|Positive
The unit doesn't really cool all that well. I've purchased a traditional a/c unit instead.|Negative
It's a perfect unit for a greenhouse. It can be controlled by an external thermostat as it will turn back on when power is restored. The pump can run dry without damage. The pump pulls 30 watts. The fan pulls 65, 50 and 45 watts based on fan speed. I'm very pleased.|Positive
nice quality, fits great!!!|Positive
HD wants me to review this. OK. It's a fan belt. It didn't explode into pieces, so that's a win.|Positive
Never used it.when i picked it up from store the box was damaged,and the oil for motor had leeked out.it had be stored on it's side.|Negative
After having to reseat the pump connection at the switch the unit seems to be working just fine.|Positive
It was a good fit|Positive
Not much difference even with ice cold water pored in it. I wish it did work.|Negative
its a belt to run the cooler, it only works for about a year then replace it.|Negative
I probably should have bought the next size up but I’m sure this evaporated cooler will be sufficient.|Positive
Didn't even cool 100 sf room. In a dry climate. Just made it humid and hot.|Negative
we bought this to make an automatic waterer for the chickens and it works perfectly|Positive
The Chanpion Grill Cover is sleek, easy to install & insulates extremely well against the cold.|Positive
Unfortunately after putting 3 gallons of distilled water into this machine and turning it on..it started leaking all over the floor. Two screws on the bottom left of the machine were leaking. I took the water out, which was a pain, and tried to tighten the screws, but it still leaked. Disappointed as the air did seem cool coming from the fan. It was a bit loud for my taste, but it wont bother me now as it's going back!|Negative
Appears well made with fairly heavy treated canvas. Cut generously and not too tight or too small for my cooler.|Positive
"I purchased this unit because it's compact and I can install and take it out without assistance. Even when filled with water, this cooler seems to be lighter than the A/C unit it replaced. The instructions were easy to understand. It took about an hour from the time I got it out of the box to when I powered it up. I have two reservations about this swamper; first, it is loud. Even on ""low"" it would be difficult to conduct a phone conversation in the same room. My second reservation is that this cooler uses a huge amount of water for its size. The pump has a bleed valve that siphons in excess of 10 gallons an hour. I guess this is normal for swamp coolers but if you live in an area where water costs a premium, you may want to do some research. There are ways around this, of course, but any one of them would likely void your warranty. Also, as one other reviewer noted, there is no cover so even if it's not running, outside air is coming in. In any event, we had our first 100 degree day and on ""high"" the cooler maintained an inside temperature of 78 degrees. Not frosty, but fine if you're not doing anything strenuous. For reference, I have a small home that's about 1000 sq feet total. I close off a couple rooms so this unit services a little less than 600 sq ft. Ceiling fans are helpful."|Positive
Dropped the temperature from 93 to 84 in a few hours. 3 speed fan and ice fill. Remote control is easy to use. Light weight and large rollers makes it easy to move.|Positive
The room is 12/10 room..Along with the ice pack we put ice cubes in the water, and it feels like a air conditioner..very happy with it! Cools all night..|Positive
at first, it smelled, but manual said it would. For what it is, works great for about 900sq. ft. Way better than my commercial roof unit !!!!|Positive
So it’s not to bad except for the hole to put the water in IS THE SIZE OF A QUARTER...seriously....this behemoth holds about 10 gallons.....and the well to the hole is very shallow.....hard to fill. So basically jus a higher price fan.....buy something else. Very poor design|Negative
great unit.|Positive
Yes it was very easy to assemble|Positive
Fits perfectly ! No more plastic bags and tape !|Positive
Was easy to assemble|Positive
We've only had a few days of horrible heat but the cooler has been effective in cooling things down to a very tolerable temp. It is quiet and easy to maneuver. I'm not sure about effectiveness as a humidifier but that would be a plus. I might hedge a bit on the fifth star. It's not miraculous but it does what it is supposed to do.|Positive
Fit perfectly in space. No problems at all.|Positive
This unit really does the job in dry Utah! Plus we enjoy the extra humidity it adds to the house. Our living room, with south facing windows, can get up to 92 during the day. After installing this, we could drop the temp down to a much more comfortable 81! and that was mostly on medium speed. Why only 4 stars then? VIBRATION... the unit vibrates quite a bit... if you go into the basement there is a loud hum- if we spent a lot of time down there, it would be unbearable. In the living room, where the unit is, it is bearable... but just barely. Maybe a more pricey unit would have tighter tolerances and wouldn't vibrate so much (I was told by someone that this was normal and the cooling effect is worth not sending it back). other random notes: This is a THREE speed (low, med, high), NOT a two speed as advertised. The unit is bigger than I thought.. check the dimensions.|Positive
Covers unit|Positive
Just bought one and it was delivered yesterday. Light weight and no assembly except filling water tank and putting battery in the remote control. Plugged it in the living room as our huge swamp cooler went out last year! This little fan immediately put out cool air. Denver, Co is a dry heat and today is about 85 degrees. So far I like it. When the temps rise I’ll try the frozen packs it came with. As temps here in July can be 104 to 106. I picked this because I saw it has pretty good reviews. It says water last 4 hours or so- be nice if it lasted 8 but since I just plugged it in will see ow it goes. Happy so far.|Positive
Unit did not work at all. Technician on phone said must be one of the many with a defective water pump. Returning the item was not an easy process, as well. This is an extremely poor product.|Negative
2 speed, 1/3 HP evaporative cooler motor arrived Saturday, installed it Monday afternoon. Works just fine. WTL|Positive
works better then the one that burned out|Positive
Best purchase I made in a long time. Easy to install and the remote is so convenient.|Positive
Purchased this unit today, taking it back tomorrow!!! I wasn't expecting a miricale but this is the worst. Doesn't blow hard, noisy, and the top compartment where you can add some ice cubes flows over.|Negative
Surprisingly this shape was the perfect fit for a SLIM LINE swamp cooler that the manufacturer does NOT make a cover for. I had to guess blindly at finding an extisting shape cover that would fit and accommodate a side vented slim line cooler! I was very happy with the final results!|Positive
We bought this based on some good reviews and it was small and compact. We added ice cubes, but the water needs constant draining. Removal of water can be a problem for older people. It's so low to the ground and heavy. Also, dripping water is irritating and has a musty odor.|Negative
The Cooler came all assembled and ready to go. It would help if the operating instructions were outside rather than in the bottom of the water tank. We hesitated to take anything apart to look for them. It operates smooth and quiet. The louvers distribute the air like an oscillating fan and cools our shop as well as the air conditioned assembly area adjacent to it. I have promoted the use of these coolers to our other plants.|Positive
Fit over Turbine just as advertised keeping heat in the attic area in the colder season's|Positive
Doesn't feel any cooler with the cooler/humidifier function on. I have another evaporative cooler, and while neither are as cool as normal air conditioning units, but this Luma cooler was definitely not as cool as the other existing one I have. It's basically just a fan with limited scope|Negative
Very powerful and worked right out of the box. Just attached rolling wheels. Fill about every 4 to 5 hours. Does a great job !|Positive
This product is awesome! I knew being in North Carolina and our humidity I wasn't likely to get the 20-30 degree difference, but took the chance. My house has no a/c, but does have an attic fan, which keeps my house between 80-85. After receiving my first cooler (yep I ordered another) it lowered my temperature to 70 degrees in three days (living room, dining room and kitchen)!! I can live with that! During the 80-90% humidity it will go up to 72, but again I can live with that! On low setting it lasts 8 hours before I have to fill it again. Cant wait for my next power bill to see how much power they take. Says as much as a light bulb, but we shall see. Regardless I would highly recommend, as I stated above I ordered another one for the opposite end of my house. Very satisfied and beats having an expensive window unit!|Positive
Seemed to be excellent quality - then I found out that you should never use them on roofs that have finished ceilings. Enclosed attics still need ventilation even in winter months- this came direct from two manufacturers of the turbine roof vents. Ok to cover turbine vents in barns or open ceiling shop type buildings to keep warm air in during the winter.|Positive
Swamp cooler fit well and works excellent !!|Positive
Fast delivery service, exact fit for the cooler. I've found that the aspen pads are much more effective than any of the man made pads|Positive
Fit with little adjustment and works well so no problemo !|Positive
I live inHenderson and I have it in a metal shop building and it works great.|Positive
Shipped in a very timely fashion. Easy to install in my Swamp cooler. Everything I was hoping for.|Positive
Pump is easy to install & pumps water great but only lasted one summer not even a year.|Negative
Keeps me cool when I work in the garage.|Positive
First one arrived early. High speed worked for like an hour and failed leaving low and med working. Right side pad 2/3 wet on outside center 1/3 dry. Quick return at store and ordered another to have it by coming heat wave. Arrived two days early and works great...all speeds. Small gripe when 1/4 full by gauge pump starts sucking air.|Positive
the belt was easy to install and appears to be working|Positive
Easy to install and works great at keeping the heat in and the elements out for the winter.|Positive
The belt evaporator belt fit and work as good as any other belt can't beat the price for the belt|Positive
I never realized how weak the old motor was until I bought this new one. I used to have to have the cooler on high from the start to get my house cooled down. However, with this motor I turn it on when I get home at noon (the hottest part of the day) and I have it on low until I go to bed.|Positive
would not start up right out of the box. my son-in-law bought the same motor a year ago and it quit working after one heat season|Negative
I'm still trying to decide if to return. We use this in Arizona, very dry here, in a motorhome, better than nothing but doesn't help that much when it's 90+ outside, still gets to 90 inside the MH.........|Negative
This product is excellent. The only downside is it's not rustproof.|Positive
The unit worked fine for about a week but then itstopped cooling the air and just functioned as a fanblowing hot air.|Negative
I live in Oahu and it's humid. But this cooler works great. The cooler moves so much air. You can't buy a $400 shop fan that moves this much air. The air is also feels much cooler. The packaging says that it has more cooling area due to hi-density pads on 3 sides. Makes a lot of sense. Easy to assemble, just turn over the cooler and remove the bottom cover that holds the wheels. Mount the wheels and put on the brass garden hose adapter and you are ready to go.You won't be disappointed.|Positive
Great!!! Went together and worked well.|Positive
terrible i just threw $600 down the drain i dont know how people put such good reviews if this thing is horrible wont even cool a 400 sq foot room.|Negative
No better than the standard fan. Disappointed.|Negative
Was exactly what we needed. Other one wore out after 20 years of harsh Colorado winters.|Positive
Not cold enough, blows out air makes skin feels sticky. Uses too much ice.|Negative
I had a great experience with Leroy in customer service. Love the product but the motor died after only a couple of months. Leroy is helping me fix or replace it.|Positive
it did the trick. Cooler is working again|Positive
"Not an electrician by any means but was able to connect this switch to the ""swamp cooler"" without a hitch by following the instructions and eyeballing the wires coming from said cooler. If I can do it ANYONE can do it! Have had it in operation for a week with no problems."|Positive
Very good buy. Works great.|Positive
This unit is awesome! Perfect for Arizona desert living. Price for this is reasonable. Easy to operate. Easy to move around. Cools down very fast, and has 3 speeds. We have been in Arizona for 30 years now. Wish they had these all the time. Our friend who lives off the grid in northern Arizona, has the Bonaire wall unit. It cools his entire house, with little electric use. They only have solar power. So this is a big money saver on electricity usage. If you live in the desert, you will love this unit.|Positive
Poor assembly -Motor wired wrong, it was banged up on the outside. Pumps plugged into wrong receptors|Negative
This is our second cooler that is used for a large garage. First one worked great for 15 years, just got old and worn. If this one lasts that long, I will be happy!|Positive
Canvas products can be a gamble these days, there is a lot of poorly made canvas destroying the reputation of this timeless classic fabric. This canvas cover I bought from Home Depot was a real surprise. Online purchase sight unseen, expected the worse, and got a very well made canvas product I needed. Trust me when I say plastic just doesn't work in this application nor do the nylon and other new fangled fabrics. Why? Sunlight, canvas can endure the sun, techno fibers in reasonable price ranges cannot. Buy this product with confidence. Or not, whatever dude, it's your air conditioner.|Positive
very easy assembly, cooler works very well cooling area's throughout the house.|Positive
Old Champion cooler that I purchased 10 years ago finally gave up. Purchased another Champion exactly the same as older one. I should have looked closer before purchasing New models, made in China, are a definite downgrade in quality. New model lasted one summer. Have to replace after first year. Will NOT buy another Champion.|Negative
I'm a little baffled on the design. The electrical connections that you plug the motor and the pump to are factory mounted on the sliding top inside the unit. If you need to service it and take the top off, you have to unplug everything so you can slide the top off as per the instructions. But wait, it gets a bit more complicated than that... Keeping in mind the factory mounted electrical connections have to be hardwired into an external control box or something. So, now what do you do? You'll have to have a long cord inside wrapped around something so when you slide that box off you don't have to disconnect it from your power supply. I ended up removing the control box from the ceiling and mounting it inside the unit closer to my control box. If you haven't seen me inside this may seem very complicated to understand. Here's the deal, if you're doing this yourself then be creative. If you're hiring somebody to do it that inquire about this issue so they don't put you in a bind later.|Positive
works well, easy to install, one reasonable fit person can lift and install it.|Positive
We use this valve in our fountain to keep the water at a constant level (although I am told it is for an evaporative cooler). It works well, and is a fraction of the cost for the float from a fountain store :)|Positive
I've only had a chance to use it a short time, but it does it's job on those warm days. It's quiet too. It was so easy to purchase. I just ordered it on line and had it delivered to our local store and they let me know when it arrived...in a matter of a few days. My sons picked it up for me and even installed it for me because it was so easy to install. Over all, I am very pleased.|Positive
The fan truly does help cool my patio during the very hot summer months in the south. It is not very loud at all you can still watch tv with the fan ok low or medium. My only issue with the product was the door that you poor the water in. It needs to be a lot bigger and better quality.|Positive
Good quality, great fit|Positive
Easy to install.|Positive
Had a much larger unit in my garage that didn't work as well. (Master Cool RMMB14) It was a beast and that was the reason I sold it, at Dimensions of: Width 35-3/16 In., Depth 29-9/16 In., Height 41-3/8 I had NO Room for it in my garage when not in use. I purchased this LUMA swamp cool because of it's huge 1650 CFM, for it's size. Since it gets most of it's volume (Volume = Cooling) for height it is very easy for me to find room in a 2-car garage full of tools and 2 vehicles. Just wish that LUMA would of designed a good way to install a garden hose, they say that you can do it but their system for installing it doesn't work with either of my 2 garden hoses. All the other Shop style swamp coolers I've owned had a very solid means to screw a hose on. Just my .02!!|Positive
Would love to love it. But it drip leaks at the garden hose connector, (on the fitting-to-fitting side on the cooler, not fitting-to-hose side). Even with the water pressure turned on to a trickle. Cools great. If it's outside, maybe you'll be ok with it. But what can I say, that drip every 2 secs bothers me and I'm using it semi-indoors. Will be returning this.|Negative
We bought two of these, one for each bedroom, and one started leaking water out the side on day 3. The second one started leaking on day 11. Needless to say I don't need water leaking all over my carpets and getting moldy. I have already returned the first one, and plan on returning the second shortly. Over all I am extremely disappointed because if it did not leak it works great!|Negative
Easy to install and have everything to make it work except the motor..|Positive
It didn't work at all. In fact, when we got it home from Home Depot, we discovered it was used! It still didn't work at all. But a better question is, why does Home Depot sell used merchandise as new??|Negative
I really like this motor thank u all have a Nice day|Positive
Worse motor ever. Bought two different motors and they both did not dirk correctly.|Negative
This was just a replacement part, but it fit perfectly and works as designed.|Positive
Phoenix manufacturing company makes the best darn water coolers made in the USA (this is the best characteristic about this company) and the quality/performance of their units is outstanding. I installed a PMI roof mounted unit at my folk’s home and they love it! This is why I option to try their window units and not those other cheap water coolers you find at home depot. The Brisa window unit performance is great as expected. The following would be improvements that PMI could implement in the Brisa unit; a low idle speed setting that would be quiet enough run at night, a thermostat control unit and a purge water pump. These features come in PMI's roof mounting units and I wish they would implement them on their window unit systems. But other than that, PMI rocks!|Positive
This time I put oil into it before installing. Much better and well worth it.|Positive
So far pleased with this canvas evaporator cooler cover. The cover had an extra fit so easy to get on and tie down. Compared to buying a canvas trap this cover was half the price. Time will tell how long the canvas will last with Colorado high UV.|Positive
Could not afford central air, but this unit does the job I need, and has made my house liveable!|Positive
No problems, works just fine.|Positive
"I run hot and my coworkers are freeze babies so while they use space heaters I need additional air conditioning and the ""evapolar"" works beautifully! I was using a bowl of ice in front of a fan, but this is neater and more effective. Just wish it wasn't so expensive and I hope it won't get stolen."|Positive
GreAt so far|Positive
noise level too loud...not enough information in the owners manual.|Positive
This product worked very well. We replaced the same model that we had for 6 years. The new one is very quiet. We open windows a little bit in other places in the house and the cool air distributes throughout. This is a great product for the Colorado climate.|Positive
Perfect fit|Positive
It arrived in short time, but the store was a bit slow in taking care of me when I went to pick it up 90 miles away...good thing I go to Las Cruces regularly...the cover fits fine and is made of very rugged material...should be good for another 20 years...|Positive
Solid, well built. Just what I was looking for.|Positive
as listed|Positive
Not a good product. It's just a bulky expensive fan. Ended up taking this product back to the store|Negative
Easy to install. It had all the parts for the different installation possibilities.|Positive
this stuff works great and you get more then the other other company s|Positive
works great keeps my room cool. just make sure you have good air circulation when using it i have a window open at one end of my room to draw in fresh air and a window on the other side of the room open to force out the hot humid air with a window fan since i don't really get any kind of breeze remember this is not an ac so the wind blowing from the unit is only as cold as the water you supply it with. with that in mind i always supply it with just enough cold water and ice for a few hours at a time. so that the water in the resvoir don't start warming up to abient temp. (the wind from the unit is only as cold as the water that have been supplied to the unit. It uses alot less eelectricity than an ac. and cost less than an ac unit EVAPORATIVE AIR COOLER works best only in dry hot weather|Positive
It does what it is supposed to do. It is an evap cooler and not an air conditioner so do not expect too much from it.|Positive
For the reviewers that stated that the unit is not programmable. For a HVAC system, there are plenty of thermostats that do that. This thermostat is for an evaporative cooler. You set the temperature and the unit comes on or goes off. Easy|Positive
I have four turbines at my place and every year I have to cover them for the winter. I have been using these covers since 2000 and only had to replace them twice in that time. I live in the southwest at about 7200 feet so these covers are subjected to extreme weather and temperature changes for the seven months they are used each year. One time I had to replace two units with another product which did not survive one season of use. I definitely give this product a thumbs up.|Positive
Great cooler. Use it almost daily. Best when humidity is low and outdoor temperature is high.|Positive
We got it home completed set-up, electrician verified connections then the unit shut down after a couple of seconds! Electrician made several attempts to restart unit but it shut down repeatedly. Trouble shooting revealed the units Remote control and main control module was faulty! I was referred to the manufacturer who immediately sent a new controller and it arrived within a couple of days! The Electrician installed the New Control box and made all connections and the Unit works great now! After a Day's use, it still keeps chugging right along! Thank's to All involved!|Positive
It is very efficient and provides the cooling we required in our room.|Positive
Pads are constructed of a thinner material than they use to be.|Negative
Quality as expected, delivered earlier than expected|Positive
It works for the price but by no means does it cool the room by “20-30 degrees” as it states in the product description.|Negative
Worked just fine.|Negative
Great Product! Glad I bought it.|Positive
Great item. Plastic construction pretty good with soft water. Add some vinegar once a week to break down salt and sediment. Keeps my home between 79 and 81 during monsoon seasons hottest part of the day and a decent 75 at night. Easily fits through the window I plan on installing it permanently installing in the wall. I currently pay 1/3 of what my monthly electric bill was. Pays for itself during one summer.|Positive
Excellent service works perfect|Positive
Works really good at humidifying my room with a cool breeze. Looks nice too!|Positive
Bought this unit to help cool my workshop. It's and old building with concrete block walls and a tin roof about 800 sq ft, well within the specs of the unit. Gets up to 100+ degrees inside on hot days (I have a thermometer and humidity guage in the shop). The fan works great and the unit is easy to roll around. But it doesn't seem to do much on the cooling. It might knock the temperature back a degree or too directly in front of the unit, but so far it hasn't really helped the way I had hoped. I am located in South Carolina. Maybe our humidity it too high for it to work properly or my shop conditions are just too hard to handle. It does evaporate the water rather quickly. It has a guage on the front to tell you how much water is in the tank, which is nice. It comes with a hose attachment, but I have not used this. I pour water in the front with a bucket. But the unit will not remove the last few inches of water. As long as you keep the level above 1/4, it seems to operate fine. I paid $279 for the unit on special purchase and feel it's worth that to have the nice roll around fan. I plan on keeping the unit just for the fan. And if the air is a little cooler, that's good too. After a month of use, I have had no operational issues with the unit. I gave it a 4 star rating because it seems to operate well overall and I like the fan and mobility. Just wish the cooler was better.|Positive
The thing stunk up my house|Negative
"Mesa, AZ. I grew up with swamp coolers, but over the years home builders have shied away from them. Too dated, I suppose. I do remember that during certain times of the year (when humidity was low) they worked quite well. After 25 years of not having one, I decided to buy one for use in early and late summer to (hopefully) offset the cost of running AC during those times. I chose the Bonaire Durango 4,500 cfm model because of it's slim design, ability to cover 1600 sq. ft. and the good reviews it has received. I mounted it in my den window (after building a simple wood framework within the window frame.) This placement afforded an almost straight air flow from den to living room, to hallway and into the master bedroom. In a nutshell, the whole length of my house. The first full day of running (105' outside temp) showed the den temp at 77', with each of the other rooms at 79'. Today was 100' outside; rooms were at 76' and 79' respectively. These readings were all at the ""Low Cool"" speed. To be sure, do your homework about cooler placement and a water source, it makes a difference. I bought a new shut off valve with an extra feeder for the ""cold"" line under the kitchen sink. Then it was as simple as drilling a hole thru the wall then running the 1/4"" copper tubing to the cooler, about five feet away. I am quite pleased with the performance of this unit."|Positive
GREAT COOLER MY LAST ONE LASTED 23YEARS|Positive
Even with the ice pack and huge chunks of ice it does not even come close to cooling my tiny bedroom almost up to 20 degrees as it had stated. It doesn't even cool it maybe more than a degree or 2 and just works more like a fan.|Negative
The controller was relatively easy to install and setup. It took a day or so to tweek the thermometer calibration to get a readout that somewhat agreed with other thermometers in the house. I chose to custom set the pre-start pump time to 2 minutes; seems to work well with my 5500 cfm cooler. So far I haven't had problems with the controller producing heat that may effect the thermometer reading. Funny thing is that the controller comes with a small plastic screw driver but there is no purpose for it.|Positive
End of summer quick fix. Very simple to install on Champion Cooler 3000 DD. Fit in the mounting bracket, and remembered to save the old plastic basket filter.|Positive
This unit isn't quiet but it really works good if you put it by an partially opened window and have other windows opened a little on the other end of the house. It also helps to close off rooms that you're not using. I fill it to almost full with buckets in early evening and it last almost all night and I turn the pump off for at least 30 minutes and run the unit to dry the pads like the owners manual recommends. The air coming out stays really cool for a long time with the water in the pads. I have not tried the hose connection so I can't comment on that. The manual also says to clean it often and the pads will last for years. It should be easy to roll outside and use the yard hose to do that. Only a couple of screws to remove on the back. I ordered this cooler online which was convenient and I was notified when it had shipped and when it was at my local store for pickup. Which was also convenient. Be sure to print out the order info page or right down the order number and have it with you for pickup. The pickup went well. It is a big cooler so you will probably need a truck to get it home. I found the 4 casters and the 16 screws in a compartment on the bottom of the unit after I opened the top and the bottom to try to figure out how to take it out of the box. The cooler basically takes up the entire box so I had it laying down in the truck with the bottom facing out the tailgate after I had put the casters on and I pulled it out of the box and onto the driveway. It was then easy to roll it into my house. The water level label did not stay in place with the glue that it was put on with but the water level is easy to see even without the label on the unit. I have tried to reattach it with the existing glue but it won't stay on. I will use some superglue when I get around to it but the level is easy to see.|Positive
Does what it is supposed to do... watch out though, it comes in 115V and 220V -- I bought the wrong one the first time...|Positive
Works better than expected even with the Texas humidity|Positive
Let's see, where do I start. Odd size, at least to my thinking. If you look at what they want to pass off as a register you almost laugh. Lightweight plastic grill. Their idea of closing it is to remove it, insert a piece of cardboard (included) and screw the register back in place. Yikes. So, I bought a good quality 12 x 12 register that will open or close but it's a little too big. Next size down, 10 x 10 is way too small. The only thing it's got going for it is the spring loaded flap that opens at very slight pressure differences but it's pretty flimsy. I'm disappointed.|Negative
Works very well in our Arizona room!|Positive
The cover is high quality, and the delivery time was astounding.|Positive
Great product. Curious to see how long it lasts. I planned on purchasing another unit but the price went up way too much. $286.00 to $350.00. 20 gallon resivoir would be better with larger fill door. Water level gauge is off. Unit needs 10 more gallons at half way mark. Send me a coupon code so I can purchase another one at the same price please, please, please!|Positive
Fan burned out after 3 weeks. No power to unit. Tried different plugs|Negative
I bought this Cooler recently. Value for money Product.|Positive
I cannot speak for its longevity but it works as advertised right now. A less expensive alternative to other more expensive models!|Positive
We so wanted this to work for our sunroom. We have vertical sliding glass windows in the entire room and couldn't purchase a traditional air con unit due to not being able to vent it out of sliding windows efficiently. We hoped this evaporative unit would work beautifully but alas, even with a full tank of water, the temperature of the room didn't decrease at all. Certainly not the many degrees you advertise. If we were to add ice to the water as suggested perhaps it will work a tad better, but we will not be running to the store to buy big bags of ice every day in the summer. I will use this only when we are entertaining guests in our sunroom.|Negative
Shipping company lost the cooler for a couple days. It was bent up a little but straightened easily. Very little documentation. Store people didn't know much about it or how to get more information. Still don't know how to install it properly. Ordered a $180 1hp motor as it doesn't come with one. No pulley available from Home Depot. Very stinky even after running a month. A bit difficult all the way.|Negative
This unit performed as well as I expected it to for an evaporative cooler. The water helps provide a little bit of coolness, and adding ice does give it nice chill. If the unit is not placed by an open window or door, as suggested, the room will get humid, musty and have an unpleasant odor. However, when used correctly, the unit works well for small rooms. I gave this unit an average rating, but added one more star because of the excellent customer service I received through Arctic Cove. The first unit I purchased did not work correctly, and Arctic Cove quickly sent me a new, working unit. I'm satisfied with my purchase.|Positive
Fits great and works well.|Positive
Excellent fit, easy to install; haven't rated with 5 stars only because it is only 1 month old; I'd like to see how it holds up to weather over time. If it does as advertised, it should last a long time and clearly rate 5 stars.|Positive
Love my Hessaire! Does a fabulous job in my outdoor kitchen. Changes the air temperature by 15 degrees even now when we are having historically high temperatures and humidity! GREAT!|Positive
Sorry - I can't recommend at this time. It was purchased to be used as an air conditioner cover as I am preparing for a typical midwest winter. I know it says Evaporative Cooler Cover but the dimensions were perfect for my application. Unfortunately,I never got to find out how well it will hold up to the elements as I had to return it. Upon initial unpacking, I was overwhelmed by a noxious chemical odor that I found irritating. The odor was so strong that it filled the room up. VERY STRONG ODOR. I thought to myself, this thing goes outside anyway and will eventually air out so I was prepared to live with it. Then I realized the yellow color started coming off all over the place. It was on my hands and anything it came in contact with. Since it is rather large, I inevitably got the yellow dye on my clothes as I was unfolding it. It was just too messy. Much to my disappointment, I decided to return it to Home Depot (really wanted it to work out). The lady at the courtesy desk immediately smelled it when I walked up and was turned off by the odor as well. Since I wasn't able to perfectly reseal the packaging the way it came, the odor was in my car for about three days afterward. I actually had to open it up and try to air it out for a time. Anyway, after the return was completed, I browsed for a while. As I was leaving and walked past the courtesy desk, I could see a different employee whose shift had just started, carrying the cover extended out at arms length (as far as she could reach) to a far corner of her work area -with a grimace on her face. Pew! Anyway, now the good... I bought this cover because of the many good reviews and the material itself did seem tough and durable in my hands. It was pretty heavy too, indicating to me that it probably would held up. Dimension wise, I never got a chance to fit it but just by eyeballing it, I Think it probably would have fit OK. So durability wise, I think it would probably have lasted a few years. One thing I did note was that I did not locate a corner slot or split where the cover would have fit around my refrigerant lines. I may have missed it but I don't think it was there - if so, I would have had to cut and modify the cover in order for it to fit properly. If this is important to you, then call Brian's Canvas products and confirm. I really wanted this to work out as my size was a little hard to find (36 x 36 x 36). I thought the price however, was very good and Home Depot did a great job with the shipping time, hassle free return and all that. Oh well... hope this review helps.|Negative
I used to have a roof-mounted evaporative cooler that sucked in air from the outside. When the air is blown into the home, it creates massive air pressure that pushes the warm air out the window. What prior reviewers have failed to address is that while evaporative coolers clearly do work in dry climates and clearly do cool down the air very noticeably, portable coolers cannot be relied upon to actually cool down a room. Let's say you have two open windows, and you hope that the air goes in from one window, gets sucked into the evaporative cooler and gets pushed out the other window. With a portable unit, there is a long list of things that can go wrong. When I open the window in my room, the wind usually blows the 105F desert air right into my room, so I get that hot air as well as the cool air from the portable cooler blowing at me simultaneously. Even on optimal days, the cooler does not effectively cool down a room, or if it does, anything larger than 50-60 sq ft is simply unrealistic. It certainly does not come close to being able to cool down 250 sf. In theory, if we could mount or position the unit in the optimal way, then it could achieve this, but realistically I'd think at least 80% of people are going to be disappointed with this product if they are used to a roof-mounted unit because they have the windows in the wrong places, the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, and so on and so forth. I have not found any use for the higher speeds. For me, it only makes sense to use the lowest speed and have it blowing directly at me. I have not been able to reduce the temperature in a room appreciably, but it cools me well enough when I am sitting or lying in one place. My unit has been leaking occasionally from the back. Recently it got extremely bad and the problem is that the honeycomb pad / filter is too close to the back. Apparently, the engineers who designed the unit were aware of the problem, and have built the unit so that the pad can be repositioned. You just need to tinker with it for a while. There are some plastic pieces that need to be popped out and repositioned (it's pretty obvious when you look at it). Now my cooler works without leaking. I use RO filtered refrigerated water because I have a system that I have already paid for and this should prevent mineral buildup. Occasionally I add chlorine because tap water contains that, too, and is helpful in preventing biological contamination just like in swimming pools. I use RO filtered ice cubes because I have a system already in place that has already been paid for. After three months of use, the pad / filter still looks like new and needs no cleaning or maintenance as claimed in the instructions. At $209 before taxes, it was a good spring-time deal from Home Depot.|Negative
After research I made an informed decision to buy this product, based on price, value and reading the reviews. So far so good, Thank You Home Depot for offering a good product for a reasonable price.|Positive
Does the job, we'll see if the last. Kinda Thin material.|Negative
The Velcro closure is much better/easier than having to lace up one side of the cover like my previous cover.|Positive
Serve it's purpose|Positive
Works just as good as my last one. Unit is not square so the grill wouldn't sit level enough to hold it in. Had to use screws to hold the grill on. Also the grill was bent into the pads during shipping.|Negative
Champion Cooler Model # 3000 DD looks to be made with quality materials, sections are screwed together(as opposed to being welded, which will inhibit rusting at weld points, like other brands). Only CON is that unit does NOT have a coated water pan, only painted like the rest of the unit. In the process on installing unit at this time,instructions look to be easy to understand and follow.|Positive
I have purshased the 4th New Air AF-310. 2 for gifts and 2 for myself. Have had one in bedroom for the last three summers. Keeps the room pleasnt, not cold but comfortable. Noise not to bad but do have to turn TV up a bit. I would recomend the Mew Air AF-310 to any one needing a little extra cool air in any room.|Positive
The product I ordered was just as described measurements, etc. and I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to others.|Positive
These covers are easy to install and work well in sealing my Turbine vents for the winter.|Positive
Nice performance so far. Person working the A/C section was very knowledgeable and helpful in making my selection.|Positive
We ordered a swamp cooler, when we got it home and uncovered it, it was damaged I called home depot and told them, explained I would keep it but felt I should get money off the cost, after words they did give me a gift certificate. So I am happy with home depot. And the swamp cooler works great.|Positive
Anymore, you are just paying for the metal box. There is no electrical receptacle for the motor or the pump, no overflow drain, float or pulley. The metal bends very easily as this is very cheaply made.|Negative
If you are looking for a high speed fan this is the one for you. We bought this originally to cool the house, but it doesn't do that. It's great to put in your living room to cool you off when it's blowing your direction. We ended up returning it because it would sometimes leak out the back and we want something that is going to cool the living room so the AC doesn't have to work as much.|Positive
Product replaced original motor without any changes. Work was completed within 30 minutes. I removed wires from the switch but found that I only needed to remove wires at the motor.|Positive
It was easier than expected to get this product, sans a motor and the side panels, up on the roof where it was to be installed. Seemed to be well-made, and well-coated on the interior to resist damage from the hard water in our area. Came with pre-installed aspen pads.|Positive
received on time and is installed and works fine, thanks|Positive
It was very easy to install and I immediately felt the temp drop as soon as I started up the swamp cooler. The pads seemed a little thin, but they worked great. The next time that I order pads, I will definitely order these again.|Positive
Just took it out of the box and filled it with water and it's good to go. Easy and portable, bought it to use in my vintage airstream. Works to cool the air immediately and makes it a comfortable place to be, even at home on the property.|Positive
When the pads were taken out of the box, the large pad was mashed in a large area at the bottomof the pad. It was too late to return, as the old pads were already removed. It had to ofhappened at the factory, because the box was in perfect shape with no dents. Thesepads are expensive enough without mashed areas.|Negative
We got this for those hot summer nights in our rv. Our air conditioner just wasn’t keeping it cool. But this does the job and is wonderful.|Positive
Really doesnt cool down the specified space.|Negative
The less expensive float valves weren't doing the trick. This new bronze one is awesome, I do not need to pay so much attention to the cooler now! Thanks!!!|Positive
works gr8 so far.|Positive
I WAS ADAPTING THIS VALVE TO CONTROL WATER INPUT TO A NORMAL 2 GAL HUMIDIFIER - IT REQUIRED SOME BENDING AND FORMING TO FIT BUT IT WORKS VERY WELL..|Positive
Does well on dry sunny days as expected. Any relief in the shop is appreciated. Effiency is the main reason I went with evaporative cooler as doors are usually open where I work.|Positive
Used in my 600 gallon backyard pond. Eliminated having to have a neighbor check and add water to the pond on long vacations. Worked out great!|Positive
Great product awesome price|Positive
Easy to install. Great price. My unit started running cooler immediately after the pads were replaced.|Positive
I had to return this 1 week after purchase because the pump no longer worked.|Negative
Doesn’t cool the room it was placed in.|Negative
We are happy with this. Recommend ensuring you measure every pipe that comes out of cooler to ensure proper size.|Positive
"I'm going to save a lot of money on air conditioning bills this summer with this thing. It can set up in the living room for day use and roll into the bedroom at night. Being engineered for indoor/outdoor use it can also sit on the covered back patio so I don't feel all cooped up in the house all day. It rolls very easily on four wheels. Even has a cupholder for your drink and a storage compartment for whatever else you like to keep close at hand or the remote control. It is well built with no loose parts. It's not too big or too small, a good size. The noise level is by no means ""quiet"". But if it's cooling on a budget, who cares? I could see this as a plus at night as its pure white noise drowns out neighbor's barking dogs and traffic noise. It can be used as an evaporative cooler or as just a fan. The fan only function is surprisingly strong. When used as an evaporative cooler water can be added manually through a conveniently located, wide-mouth, side-mounted port. There is a sight gauge with minimum/maximum markings on the water tank. Or if you prefer, a hose can be connected to fill the reservoir with automatic shut-off when max capacity is reached. I imagine the hose connection is the preferred method when used outdoors or semi-permanently in a workshop or garage. The brand is Honeywell, an old(more than 100 years) and well-known company in HVAC, among other things."|Positive
Its too much work for too little reward; it needs to be drained and filled with ice daily. The fan is noisy.|Negative
Perfect thank you|Positive
Works well. Has a hum, but I don't think it's the motor.|Positive
I bought mine a little oversized to make up for the power connection, but wish I would have got one taller than 35 inches so it would pull tight around the bottom.|Positive
Does not cool very well.|Negative
It will serve its purpose.|Positive
We live in Northern California and needed an air cooler. We didn't have the money for an a/c unit and went with the alternative; an evaporative cooler. It works great as long as the temperature outside is at least in the 90's and there is a window open. The only complaint is the noise. It's VERY loud because we use it to cool the house. All the reviews I read were from AZ and spouted great things, including a bit of noise and the added humidity. If indoors, it's very loud but cools the living room off perfectly. It does get humid if you run it when it's below 90, even with an open window for cross breeze. It is exactly what we needed, save for the added fan noise.|Positive
Instructions were easy to follow. unit lowers air temp better than I expected.|Positive
It keeps my garage 10 degrees cooler|Positive
First off, I live in Colorado, which is a dry climate. I hooked this thing up and within a few hours I noticed a difference... but only in humidity... This thing made my room so hot and sticky, with NO drop in temperature. I do not recommend this product for anyone. I will be returning tomorrow.|Negative
Product was easy to install. Check the box before you leave the store. Mine was missing the installation directions, media clips, and pegs. Essick Air was great about sending out replacements but the lack of these materials slowed down the installation by a week.|Positive
Attractive color and lighter weight than the other style. Good value.|Positive
on time Exactly what I orderd|Positive
My only complaint was with the online listing of this switch. Inventory on line showed many units in store. I drove to the store only to find out there were none available. They said it was a seasonal item and not available. I ordered on line anyway and immeatedly the order was filled for pickup. It cost me two trips to the store.|Negative
Nice & large....great for one room!|Positive
I purchased this for my daughter. She lives in the desert. Fresno, CA is an optimal location for using an evaporative cooler. However, she returned it this last week because it just doesn't work. It is kind of noisy. That would be okay, if it just worked. But it really doesn't do much cooling. So back it went. I like to write positive reviews, but until this product does its basic function of cooling a room, I cannot recommend it.|Negative
I am retracting my prior review of a 1 Star and giving this product a revised rating of an overall 5 Star. After having extreme difficulty with the speeds dragging and a whining sound after initially putting the motor into service, I to another store intending to replace it,, but before I did that, I was advised by the expert at the second store to check the fan belt. I did, and then I checked the blower bearings. Both were bad. I replaced them and put the motor back into service, and it has worked perfectly. Therefore I am giving this product an updated rating of 5 Star. Disregard my prior 1 Starr rating.|Positive
The motor did exactly what it was supposed to do. It did not come with the motor clamps that are needed to attach it to the swamp cooler frame so be sure to pick them up when you buy the motor if your old ones are bad or missing. You also need the connecting cable depending on how your cooler is wired or plugged in. It fit right into the spot where it belonged and worked perfectly.|Positive
We used this product when we had a heat wave and our air conditioner was broken. We stayed in one room during the day and it kept our living room cool|Positive
This cooler is significantly quieter than the previous coolers I have owned. As a result, I ended up buying a second one. A good buy for the money!|Positive
The cooler arrived undamaged and works very good.|Positive
Just what I needed to combat the often hot summer days here in Northern CA's Sonoma Valley. Easy to assemble, easy to move around my condo, and rapidly cools down either my bedroom or home office, depending on where I place it. Much easier to install and use than a portable air conditioner. Adding some ice to the water reservoir does help improve the unit's ability to quickly belt out a nice stream of cool air. Glad I bought and am thinking of getting another just for downstairs (the one I bought is upstairs).|Positive
Took a few tries to understand what the different buttons did|Positive
"In fairness, we bought this to provide a little cooling to a cabana. We weren't asking for much. At the time we tested it, it was ""Phoenix-like"" in Dallas....108 degrees and <20% humidity. We tried it with water and then the next day with ice. Maybe, just MAYBE, it was slightly cooler than the ambient air when feeling it right out of the device. It just didn't do anything."|Negative
A+ Great shaft, Repaired my evaparator fan coil exactly like it was when new, this shaft can also be used as a straw if needed during assembly, Thanks|Positive
It works excellent I like the square design and the justable legs. Recommend this brand cooler versus the rest.|Positive
I bought this Portable Evaporative Cooler to put in my barn on my horse that has COPD to keep him cool during the day to help him with his breathing. Although I live in an area with high humidity (Arkansas) it has worked pretty well so far. I've had it about 2 weeks. I would recommend this cooler.|Positive
We replaced a 45 year old swamp cooler for this one, and to say the least i am disappointed.. it does no good for us to cool down our house and barley maintains the outside temp... so on days that its 96 degrees, its 96 in my house too.... and my ENTIRE house is 1700 sq. ft. so my upstairs is the only floor that gets cooled, is half of that. You would think it would be cooler. However to my disappointment and 700 dollars later, definitely not worth it...|Negative
I am very happy with this cooler. I would definitly recomend it to others.|Positive
I especially like the three panel direction vents in this model. This gives the unit an appreciated flexibility in flow direction. Having worked for Fedex for 28 years I appreciate that the unit arrived at the local Home Depot several days before the stated arrival commitment day. Well done and excellent counter service through the purchase process.|Positive
Great purchase, $500 plus a 3 yr warranty made it a little over $600...perfect But for that amount I got 1600 sq feet coverage...nice...It fit perfectly into my window..only took 30 minutes...snug as can be..it makes little noise...the fan spreads the cool air throughout my entire home...No worrying anymore about the roof swamp leaking water into my roof and side of home.. and you can't notice it, *Best purchase for this hot summer in NM* It did have a bit of a smell when first running it, (mild) and it did go away...|Positive
Easy install shipping was on time|Positive
I paid $354 and tax for this about 3 weeks ago. I use a few hours a day, at work. The motor has burned up, already. It's well built, but where do I get a decent motor ?|Negative
Worked great easy wire up and install fits right into place|Positive
I have used two of these exact covers through the past 20 years or more. Easily they gave me ten years plus of winter protection. By far, they are the best cover made. Highly recommend for good protection and longevity.|Positive
"Use this in my 2 car garage. Mounted it on the side wall high up thru wall. Nice having a cool place for the cars in the 115 degree days. It will usually lower the outside temp about 30 degrees when the humidity is under 20%. I also have a chest freezer in the garage. Installed a purge pump, and ran a 1/2"" PVC line to the backyard for the drain water, as I didn't want it going down the driveway. Don't have a thermo on it yet, so I use a 1500 watt wall timer."|Positive
The blower sucked water off of the pads and into the motor. The motor did not last a month. I had to design and install shields to keep the water out of the blower. The clearance between the blower and the pads is less than three inches.|Negative
Just what I expected and more. So easy to use and produces the calling air. I use mine in a screened in porch and it provides the air flow along with ceiling fan that I need for the summer.|Positive
Great cooler, has managed to make the upstairs loft very comfortable.|Positive
Works perfectly, motor installation and hook up was easy, quickly cooled down our home!|Positive
Good quality, meet my expectation.|Positive
Pads worked perfectly and box was not damaged.|Positive
I was able to purchase this cooler on sale and it works very well but only in a dry climate like here in Arizona. The units performance is very high as stated but it's construction is not what I would call heavy duty. We must remember this unit with 3,100 CFM cost 33-50% less that similar units of this performance level and I use it for our patio where a heavy duty unit is not needed or wanted to it's a good fit for me at a good price level.|Positive
Blows cool air on you, but not good for humid weather because it's moist air.|Negative
Fit perfectly into my evaporative cooler. Looked for this last year to no avail so glad you are now selling it.|Positive
Ready to go right out of the box. Add water and plug in. Works good. Keeps my shop 10-20 degrees cooler than without it.|Positive
Customers love this product! Great price, great quality. Installs easy.|Positive
I bought this cooler on July 14th and had to return it August 18th. While it did somewhat cool the room, the indicator sound for low water kept going off when the tank was full. Not sure I’d recommend this product unless you want to return it after a month of purchasing it.|Negative
I was pleased with the cover, light and easy to install.|Positive
Perfect fit, reasonable price AND it was made in America!|Positive
Fit like it was made for my cooler. Very nice|Positive
Straps are great addition to cooler cover. Went on easy. A lot better than rope that I used before.|Positive
Works very well, and super strong fan. Love the hatch in front to add ice to the water, although it would be nice if it was a little bigger opening. Overall, a great unit and priced right.|Positive
I don't know how I got along without my evaporative cooler! I have used it inside the kitchen door and it cools half of the ranch style house (the half that I live in)! It is not too loud, a tank of water lasts all day.|Positive
The main reason I would not recommend this unit is that there is no fill indicator and no way to accurately tell when the tank is low. It has a low water alarm that apparently beeps once and you have to be lucky to hear it. The rate it uses water is a function of your settings, the humidity level, and air temperatures. So it uses water at different rates. It can use up 4 gallons in just a few hours and then shut off. You also cannot tell if you are overfilling. You want a unit that has a fill indicator if they exist. Another complaint is that the owner's manual is very cryptic and the troubleshooting section is worthless.|Negative
"From other reviews, I expected a very flimsy, cheaply made unit. I found it to be very well built and only had a couple of issues with my purchase. The knock out plug for the electric is definitely impossible to knock out, and the unit is much easier to install if you first remove the squirrel cage. Problem is, the squirrel cage was installed mid-assembly, and not meant to be removable. Bent one of the support braces, removed the motor mount, and it came out making for two, much lighter pieces to get on the roof. I personally prefer to replace my pads every year with the rolled ""blue"" cooler pads, and use a higher gpm pump, so my cooler keeps 2000 sq.ft. of living space very comfortable. Inspect the unit before purchasing,(good advise on all purchases), and good luck finding someone at Home Depot to help load it."|Positive
Equipment good,easy to set up. Delivery was an issue.|Positive
Pump works perfect for non-commercial purposes and lasts.|Positive
The description of the product was perfect! We got what we paid for!|Positive
worked good droped the room temp about 10 degrees|Positive
I absolutely love it. This little cooler keeps the room so cool and incredibly comfortable. I highly recommend it.|Positive
Works great as a space cooler which is what I needed it. My bedroom gets blazing hot at night and AC just doesn't cool it enough to sleep. I bought this cooler so it will blow cool air over my bed and for that it does the job. I tried cooling the room itself but you only really feel the cool air if you're in front of it. It has the added plus that it filters the air so it's done wonders for my allergies.|Positive
I live in the Mojave Desert. Its working right now. The time to do a real product review would be next summer. If it can hold up to the hard water, extreme heat and constant use it will be a miracle. It pumps plenty of water but I haven't had a pump last an entire summer. I use a screen and all the recommended recommendations for the pumps but its brutal here.|Positive
My old pump was dismal, and this pump covers my window unit perfectly. It is also quiet compared to my old pump. I also installed the protective water bath which helps to clean my water.|Positive
Easily torn down to enable rooftop installation.Keeps house cool on low speed.|Positive
The Tie down straps are essential for windy areas like chicago. During the past very high winds, the evaporator cover did not even appear to have any problems.|Positive
IT ONLY LASTED 2 MONTHS, THEN STOPPED, I HAD TO PAY AN AIR CONDITIONING GUY 100.00 FOR LABOR TO REPLACE.|Negative
Straight forward installation. Replaced a smaller pump which came with the unit (same brand) which lasted only 3 months...|Positive
Heat in the south can be pretty brutal. With not having central air we use the cooler to keep our daughters room cool. While it doesn't cool it like an air conditioning, when using ice packs within the tank on the cooler it keeps her room comfortable. Would recommend for cooling a small room|Positive
Great pads at an excellent price. These pads are a solid, well made product that perform as well as the original, but at less than half the price of the manufacturer brand pads.|Positive
This cooler is great! whether its cooling my garage or my pool area it gets the job done.|Positive
This product does a great job cooling my 400 Sq ft office space. It arrived sooner than expected. Great customer service at pick up at the store|Positive
We bought this to cool the garage since there's no air in there. Received it in July. Temps were running 105-108. Just moved into our new home and the air conditioner went out. We had only received this 2 days before. So I set it up and it kept the house about 80 degrees which is quite comfortable with the fans going until we could get the air conditioning fixed. I even add ice cubes to help cool the water down. Works GREAT! Love the oscillating fan.|Positive
[To Home Depot Customer service] Please provide return shipping label for order # W457929567. A return label was was not included with the the package. The Unit is not functioning as expected. the temperature in the room increases after it is turned on. Checked waster flow, and it is functioning. But the air temperature is the same with the water turned on, or off. I would like to return this product. And buy something else. Attempting to cool an area that is 112 S.F. with 7 ft. ceiling. Half the rated size.|Negative
Easy to install. Remote allows me to turn it off from bed.|Positive
We bought this cooler to replace a 5000 btu window cooler. We have a 1200 sq ft house and this cooler will freeze us out. Sometimes we have to turn it off to warm up or turn off the water to it and just use the fan. It is probably to big for our house but we don't care. It does a great job and keeps us cool. We only use the low setting because the high setting will blow everything close to it away. We love it, it's way better then the Freon coolers.|Positive
This is my 2nd belt for my swamp cooler. Last one lasted a year. That's ok for only $6. Easy to put on. If you don't know how, look on YouTube. Seriously, only takes likes 30 seconds. Left out a star because they could have made it better and chose not too.|Positive
Our MC37V arrived on a recent 110 F day in east San Diego county. Our downstairs area is not much larger than the maximum square footage rating for the unit. I wasn't expecting much when I started it up but we haven't had to use the central AC since. This unit not only maintains our downstairs area at 75 F on the low setting but we get a great air change that we wouldn't with central AC because of the outside air required to control humidity. For indoor use, the unit is somewhat noisy (even on low) and large but indoor use is not its intended purpose. It is recommended for garages, outdoor work areas, pavilions and the like. There's nothing misleading or untruthful in the marketing of this product. When it arrived, the control panel had popped out of place, but it was easily reinstalled and the unit started and worked well immediately. Evaporative coolers aren't for every cooling situation. Humidity levels and airflow greatly influence perceived performance. Hessaire seems to have done a great job engineering the evaporation pads, water flow and airflow in this unit. Another reviewer said that the material and configuration of the pads make this a superior model. Whatever they did, they got it right. Today it was 100 F and I can still maintain my living area at 75 F without central AC.. I am still very pleased and would definitely buy this again in the same situation.|Positive
I order by mail, it took 3 weeks to get here. I installed and it work 2 days. Well be taking back to the store today.Right during our current heat wave. I ordered a second pump from the Fontana store for pick up.My daughter pick it up and had my granddaughter bring if to me in Orange. I installed it and so far it is still working. I never had a pump die in all the years(20) I have used them.|Negative
Cools room nicely|Positive
it didn't work- the water pump failed, so I had to return it.|Negative
Good product just overpriced as usual.|Positive
This product stopped working and although they say they will take it back for a year, they wanted me to open it up and check the panel. Told me the book that came with it will help me determine if that is the issue. I didnt open it up because I would have no idea what I am looking at so I have a non working evaporative cooler and wasted my money. Pick a different brand!!|Negative
This is a GREAT unit - very economical and installation is very simple...only took 2 hours and we started cooling the house down! Cools down quickly. Could be a bit quieter, but still better than the attic fan currently in the house|Positive
Works great in a dry climate like Denver. Not as quiet as I would like, but more quiet than my previous one, not sure you can get more quiet than this one anyway, and the white noise helps me sleep. Love being able to use the remote to turn it off in the middle of the night without getting up.|Positive
Easy to setup, worked well and convenient to move around.|Positive
I'm really happy with this cooler. It really does a good job of cooling the house on really hot days. I'm getting another one for the patio.|Positive
We received our order very quickly, pads fit great.|Positive
I live in South Texas where it’s been getting up to 105 degrees during the summer months. I work out of my garage so I needed something to cool it down a bit. First day I used it, I ran it for 10 hours. Worked like a champ and I only had to refill once. The casters make it easy to reposition|Positive
This was easy to put on and secure with the additional straps I purchased. So far, so good.|Positive
Worked great easy to install|Positive
I have to fill it twice a day and it only cools my room a few degrees|Negative
Works like a charm|Positive
Excellent over all, not too tough to install and made a big difference|Positive
It works good. I ended up buying two more for my boys room|Positive
It was not for use in a standard evaporative cooler|Negative
I have no Air Conditioning and usually don't need it, but there are times when my room is just too hot to sleep in. I got this fan for that purpose and I love it. It cools, its not like an AC, but its cooler than just a fan. I would recommend this to anyone who is in my situation and does not have AC but needs something cooler once in a while.|Positive
It is everything I expected of it. Good price and Fast Free Shipping !|Positive
I haven't been able to use this yet as It came without the knob in the back to the water tank so it won't open. I called the company directly and they promised to send me the knob but didn't. I am going to return this.|Negative
If this product ever would operate after being manufactured, Home Depot would definitely make a small gold mine on it... the submersible pump on my delivered model NEVER came on and worked at all :( whether it was not wired properly or the pump itself was faulty I don't know, and i sure wasn't about to re-order ANOTHER unit to find that out... I returned the defective unit to my local Home Depot and had them reimburse my Home Depot accnt. I then purchased other less-priced units thru another online heating-cooling company. Sadly, Home Depot's loss-- *dean*|Negative
NYC can be quite humid during the summer. I am very happy I found this item. It cools down my studio apartment during those hot and humid days w/o the cost required of an air conditioner. The purchase of the Luma Comfort EC110S Portable Evaporative Cooler was probably the best investment I made this summer in regards to my comfort. It's light and portable, easy to maneuver and clean. I received many compliments from those who saw it, experienced it and they said they want to buy it for themselves for next summer.|Positive
cools very well when using frozen block that comes with it - directions for different setting a little confusing- i would have given it 5 stars, but the water reservoir cannot be completely removed and instructions say to clean it every couple of weeks- looks like a cleaning challenge|Positive
The cooler is too noise when it turns on.|Negative
The unit description says it cools and all I found was that it cools better with out using the moisture. Makes the room humid more than anything. Just buy a cheap box fan.|Negative
"I have used this cooler a few times now. When used out in the open (on a patio) you really have to stay in front of it to feel a temperature change. The one time I did use it inside a building 15x30"", I had a 10x10 door open but could still feel a difference in air temperature. Still curious to see how it works with all doors shut. The fan itself is very powerful. Remember to turn the pump on first to let water saturate the filter material before starting the fan, and then when done, turn the pump off first to let the fan dry out the filter material."|Positive
This is perfect for a small area and so easy to move around! What is especially nice is there are no hoses of any kind. Just fill with water, plug in and you're good to go! Nice design compared to others, too! :-)|Positive
It's been 105 for a week where I live, unusual for the coast. This I was glad to have, it's not instead relief from the heat but keep it going with ice water and my rooms were liveable|Positive
motor is too noisy and makes a weird noise when it turns on, and a rolling noise when blowing, and not quite enough air. hope to return it when I can get it off the roof. C Kubiak|Negative
"After filters were soaked and it ran for 4-5 hrs the shop actually got warmer by a degree and ridiculously more humid. IMO it does not work in a already humid environment. NOTE: Home Depot uses a third party to ship this. Took 3 weeks to get it to my shop. Super disappointed after waiting to get it for it not to work as advertised. Maxxair CLAIM: ""It can lower temperatures by up to 26° without the use of air conditioning."" Not in my case. I would say they must have had a controlled environment to make that statement. Sorry for the bad review but my whole experience was a disappointment. Sent it back. The Good - My Local Home Depot store took it back no questions asked! This would have been a nightmare if I had ordered it on Amazon or through an online store. THANK YOU, THANK YOU Home Depot folks!!! Big fan (no pun intended)"|Negative
It has a one year life span. Must be replaced every year. Overall poor quality but seems to be all that is available.|Negative
This is the best evaporative cooler I have ever owned. I would recommend this product . It is easy to install and maintain.|Positive
We do not have A/C In The Mountains, But is Still Warm At Night, Now We Have Portable A/C|Positive
"Beware. This is NOT a programmable thermostat. When talking thermostats, the word ""programmable"" typically means the user can program the device for different time/temperatures. Most conventional thermostats have four time periods a day, with the option for different programming each day of the week. This device does not allow such a function. It is simply a digital thermostat, without the ability to set time/temperature changes. I contacted the manufacturer, and the representative claims the ""programmable"" term refers to the ability to pick a temperature, and have the cooler turn on/off; what would typically be considered a digital thermostat. If you are looking for a ""programmable"" thermostat, this is not the device for you."|Negative
I bought this cooler online and took it back 5 days later. Not nearly enough water flow or cooling pad area to lower the in vs out air temp. even a little bit. My advise is to spend another 100 bucks and get something that works. I don't know how they can market this thing as a cooler, its nothing more than a fan, definitely not worth a hundred bucks.|Negative
It's good!Working smoothly.|Positive
You get what you pay for, there are pricier units and much cheaper units. I got this for the sq ft coverage and cfms. What I worry about is that the plastic used on this unit is not top of the line so it can break if not careful. There are fragile hoses and such at the base that you have to watch out for when removing and replacing top as you fill base with water. There really isnt much downside to it. I get roughly four hours use out of a tank. The cool perks I didnt notice when ordering are oscillating fan and a low water chirp. Dont let it run out or you can kill the pump. I know if I had paid more I would get more. This is a reasonable price for this unit but humidity is likely going to determine if its the right fit for you. I give it an A.|Positive
This is a great product and works well in our 12' x 25' greenhouse|Positive
Tons of power, quiet motor. Exactly what our shop needed to cool down and keep working.|Positive
I am very pleased with this unit.|Positive
This cooler is awesome!! It blown beautiful cool air. I can work comfortably in the garage in mid 90 temperatures. I highly recommend it.|Positive
I installed it in 45 minutes the easiest one I've ever installed I like the remote control|Positive
it was easy to install ,seems to work good,hope it will last a long time,just been running for about a week4/18/17|Positive
These pads fit my Breezair evap cooler perfect and are about half an inch thicker than the ones I had purchased last year. I definitely recommend these, especially with the free shipping.|Positive
They came days earlier then expected. They fit perfectly. I hosed them off real good to get rid of as much odor as possible and after a couple days the smell was gone. I didn't realize how poorly the cooler was working until I put the new ones in.|Positive
Only A bit over 300 watts excellent cooling in dry air, quiet on low especially, Have not used in triple digit weather 24x24 garage no insulation. J.D.S.|Positive
Two week delivery, easy set up, simple to use controls, oscillating feature works great. low speed is enough to comfortably cool our west facing 28; x 16' deck on a 100 degree day. Noise level on low speed is easy to have a conversation over. We and our guests are HAPPY! We have only had it a month so don't know yet about durability, but it seems well built and simple to maintain.|Positive
FIT WAS PERFECT. GREAT PRODUCT|Positive
I love my new portacool|Positive
Works well. Am pleased with it.|Positive
Works incredible. I was so skeptical that it would keep our home sufficiently cool in the High Desert heat. It was the machine for the job. We have a 1400 sq ft single story home and it was sufficient.|Positive
My older small cooler (WCM28) was still working, but I said that if one with a remote became available I would get one. Here it is. This model is a real improvement. The motor is replaceable and belt drive, the older one is direct drive. I have killed at least two of the old ones while cleaning by splashing water into the motor. Next, the side panels are removable. That will make it much easier when replacing the pads. Next, it has a remote. This cooler is in our bedroom, and it has a little more capacity than the older one, so sometimes when the weather gets hot it will be necessary to turn it off or down in the middle of the night, the remote will come in handy for that. Installation is a snap, especially if it is just a replacement. and it really gets cool. We had an early heat wave and with outdoor temps at 95 it was cool inside. Get this cooler if you need to cool a smaller space!|Positive
Ordered online, good price. Ready for pick-up at Home Depot in days. Smells for the first few hours of operation, works fine even so. Ran the last set 2 years (2 summers), plugged up pretty bad.|Positive
I bought 2 of these last year, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. We used it for most of the 100+ weather of last year. I live in Las Vegas and yes in a house. It is 107 outside right now and the only things I have going are both evap coolers and ceiling fans. My house is 81 and comfortable. I really like these coolers they seam to do a great job. The outer plastic is cheap but so are most cooler housings. On one of my coolers the inside screws that hold the filters on were all rusting, not too happy about that but I just purchased new non-rusting screws. I get about 8hrs on low with this cooler when it is full. It definitely makes a difference where you place these cooler that give you the best temperatures.|Positive
Don't know if this really works. But it was cheap and it's worth a try.|Negative
this cooler works very well sitting right in front of it with ice in the top and ice in the water it feels like you're sitting in front of an air-conditioner . On the one hand I wish I would've bought one sooner on the other hand waiting till now I love this product you have any advanced features like the isolation and moving movers that make it a much better product than I would have had.|Positive
Smaller than I expected-that's a good thing, makes some noise but tolerable, what matters most is the CHILL FACTOR!! Wow it cooled my living room quick. It was just what we needed.|Positive
Fast delivery, easy set up, works well for the money.|Positive
Better than the ones than cooler came with.|Positive
Just fine. They fit and were what I ordered and arrived in reasonable time. What more could I ask?|Positive
It works well but the information is lacking on specs. It does not include any control switch, crossbar mounting bar, vent grille or ducting. It does include the float valve, pump, aspen media, assembled spider array arms. It requires 1/2” tubing about 3’ long that’s not included.|Positive
It works. It's economical. I was replacing pumps costing much more every 1-2 years. These last a year or more, at 1/4 the cost. It barely keep up with 6500 CFM, but do well at 4500 CFM. I just plan on replacing it at the start of every summer. The power cord could be longer (at about 3'), but I can deal with that.|Positive
These were so easy to install. Exactly what I wanted.|Positive
Bought 2 of these for both kids rooms they say that they work good andworky keep room cold...|Positive
Bought it for my husbands shed and it works great he loves it, and with this hot weather lately we brought it inside and it makes a huge difference|Positive
I bought this about a week ago and installed the very next day! It great for keeping my house cool upstairs - No more sweaty nights on top of the sheets! Was easier to install than putting together a bookcase and I cracked the window in my bedroom about 3 inches and the air moves right through my room and humidity carries out. Yeah make sure to crack a window just a few inches so the air will flow in the direction you want, otherwise it will just get humid and act as a fan. Great for Denver weather, since it's so dry. The length of the cord could have been a little longer (just saying).|Positive
Works great in the garage and on the patio. The tank is sufficient for about 30-45 minutes of cooling. The hose feature works well and no leaks.|Positive
The cooler works well in my big open-plan living/dining/kitchen area, and is a good alternative to a window cooler that takes up too much view. It needs to be used with a window open, and can be moved easily around the room to avoid being in the way.|Positive
It helps keep weather out.|Negative
Delivery delayed several times. hired three professionals to install and item still doesn't work. Delivery company refused to bring 20 feet up to house from the curb unless I bought him lunch. Originally he wanted $100 to walk it 20 feet. Item was damaged in several places. Cooler doesn't work with my indoor switches that I've used for my last four swamp coolers. I've now paid $400 to three professionals to install this unit and they can't get it running. They've all worked on it for nearly a week now. It now does low/cool (very low) and nothing else. If it's turned to high the pump shuts off and hot hair comes into the house. I can no longer afford to keep trying to find people to install this thing. All these men have installed numerous swamp coolers over the years and never had a problem. If your company can't solve this problem and get this unit working correctly, please come and get the item back and return my money.|Negative
Set up was easy and works almost instantly when you take it out of the box, no assembly required other than fill or hook up to water. With that said, I would like to review after I have used it for a while and further my comments to be more helpful. Currently in the Southwest we are experiancing very humid weather. As you know an evaporative cooler needs a dry climate to work so I have not been able to use it to its fullest extent or really at all with any effectiveness. Some particulars i am going to be watching are the side and rear panels of what looks like paper that the water trickles down and the air is drawn accross for the cooling. These in past units have been straw or some sort of plastic filter. It appears, even after hours of use that the panels do not become completely wet. That may not be a problem as I need to have some dry weather before I can fully evaluae the unit. If you live in a humid climate, you already know you can't use this type of cooler.|Negative
I use this mainly to cool down my upstairs bedroom so I can sleep comfortably. It does the job well and allows me to turn of the central AC at night to avoid having to cool down the whole house just to get the bedroom cool. Much better than a simple fan.|Positive
This is the only product that will work for certain installations. Home Depot was the only store in town that had any left in stock.|Positive
This portable evaporative cooler worked ok for couple of days then leaked all over my carpeting. We drained the water receptacle completely, let it dry, then looked for leaks. We did not find any so we moved it to the kitchen floor where it proceeded to leak enough to wet the floor and it leaked so much this time it reached the carpet again! We think the pump might be faulty. We are returning it today. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.|Negative
Works very well gets very cold|Positive
I would of given this ZERO stars if I could of. Did not cool down my living room at ALL. It blew out warm air even after I put a whole bag of ice and cold water in the tank. The fact that they have a picture of it by a pool is absolutely ridiculous. Now I have to figure out how to get a few gallons of water out of it from the third floor of my apartment building so I can get it down the stairs to return it. Maybe it will work better in dryer areas? I live in Portland, OR and while there is a lot of humidity in the air, it has been incredibly DRY for two-three months (and 95-100 degrees!) so this should of worked. I have had to stay with family members because my apartment is so hot - this would of really helped! NOT HAPPY :(|Negative
PRO: Comes fully assembled, easy to use, blows cool air - very cool if you add ice to top chamber. CON: Draining water from the unit isn’t easy. I open the side and tilt it while it drains in my back yard. Should have been designed with door and removable bucket.|Positive
Does the job no complaints|Positive
I was looking for a slim air cooling item for my workroom at the store I work at (volunteer at the SPCA Thrift Store). During the summer here in Sacramento it gets hot and my room gets hot; a fan just doesn't do it. Though the store has air conditioning, it doesn't reach my back room. I've tried my new electric tower fan at home and it's great! However, I won't be able to know for absolutely sure how great it is until this June/July/August.|Positive
Durable, easy to tie on the turbines ( I have two), but the color is terrible on top of the house. Why not neutral grey or beige?|Positive
Although larger than the unit being replaced, we were concerned that the rated square footage was less than our house size but since this is used only to supplement the refrigeration and installation size was important, we decided try this small model. No worries! Air flow is more than adequate. Do be careful installing the plastic drain fitting. It's not possible to get it really tight and it can loosen when tightening a drain hose. It needs too be held on the inside so put on a hose before closing the back.|Positive
It goes out every year|Negative
Fit , last belt lasted 5 years. This one was 20% of OEM version. So, good price fast delivery|Positive
Received it 2 days earlier than promised! Wirks great.|Positive
Recently purchased this evap cooler and does the job well by maintaining the cool temperature in my room. Not only that, this fan ionizes the air as well giving a brand new car like smell in the air. NEWAIR is not a well known brand, but the overall design and performance is a bang for the buck compare to what other box stores and retailers sell for $50 more. Get it here at air-n-water and get it fast with their free shipping.|Positive
Keeps the room about 10^ cooler than outside, even with the big windows in the living room. It really makes the upstairs more liveable.|Positive
Showed up way early. Works really well. I would recommend this to all my auto tec friends. Been great for the last few weeks.|Positive
i looked through alot of reviews and the new air evap cooler af 310 had some of the best ones. when i got it set up and going it worked great and if started early enough it would keep the room at a cooler temp as it is like a swamp cooler. i had an issue with the one i bought and contacted the support and they sent a replacement after a few verifications. i spoke with Christine and she was very nice and helpful and took care of everything in about 10 minutes. i would buy from new air in the future for sure.|Positive
I don't understand why this has received so many positive reviews. The one I bought was noisy and did not have the front numerical display pictured online. The model number was the same but the display was not. Maybe they have cut that feature from the units they are currently selling. Otherwise, it was the same unit. In any event, it would run quietly for a while and then stain and give off a low and irritating groan. I returned it the day after I picked it up - it was too loud to use in a bedroom..|Negative
I have a larger, more modern cooler with the brick-style cardboard pads. That didn’t slow down this pump at all. It wets the pads in a couple of minutes flat. Outperformed the original pump by a factor of at least 5. Great purchase.|Positive
Perfect fit and extra heavy canvas gives me peace of mind that keeps the elements out.|Positive
This cooler is as effective as a small fan. I purchased it as a replacement when our other cooler wore out. It blows a small amount of air and you can barely tell it's cooler than the surrounding air. Not worth the money in my opinion. Very disappointed.|Negative
Good product but as expected very bulky to haul up a ladder.|Positive
It was east yo install and works great!|Positive
It may be too soon to tell, but this promises to surpass the quality of the replacements previously provided by the so-called HVAC experts. The quality of materials is definitely better than the previous floats installed by the pros, and a lot cheaper in price! It was an easy DIY change-out despite the scaling built up on the old unit. After disconnecting the water supply line with a small crescent wrench, you will likely need to hold the old float in place on the inside of the cooler with a second wrench while you loosen the lock nut on the outside of the unit. Be sure to wrap the threads with Teflon tape before reattaching the water supply line. It may be necessary to bend the float arm to achieve the proper water level. Too high and it will allow water to escape through the cooler's overflow tube. Good luck!|Positive
Easy fit.|Positive
Purchased this model in 2001 and have used it steadily since then. It cools the house well, yet is economical to run. There are four settings of high or low fan only, and high or high fan with water cooling. We are just now having to perform some minor repairs. I would never go back to a regular air conditioner.|Positive
Arrived early. Easy to install. Seems to be a very high quality product.|Positive
this is a nice fan. has great power its quiet fit right back where our old one was|Positive
Quiet and easy to install|Positive
A great fan, poor evaporative cooler. Water just spews out of this thing, faster than it can evaporate. At least the fan works pretty darn well.|Negative
Does what it's sposta|Positive
Works well, just had to do some rewiring from the old to the new. Runs real quite.|Positive
The brass float valve was reasonably priced and easy to install.|Positive
great value and works as supposed to.|Positive
Mine just arrived today (really fast on the free shipping, btw). It is blowing cool air, a LOT of cool air. I live in a dry part of California, and so this is compatible with the arid climate. The fan is powerful (even on low, I can feel its breeze 15 feet away). BUT ... it is LOUD ... and I do mean LOUD .... white-noise sound .... but LOUD. I bought it hoping to cool my bedroom at night instead of a/c-ing the whole house, but no way will I be able to sleep with how loud it is. Probably I will keep it for daytime use in other areas of my house, but I'll have to look for some other option for my sleeping quarters.|Positive
"I purchased this unit back in 2010. It's worked great since then. I highly recommend it for any apartment or small house dwellers that need an energy efficient way to cool where they live.It was easy to setup and put together. NOTICE FOR ALL PET OWNERS; If your unit's pump appears to stop working, don't panic!!! Pull out the pump, and look at the inlet where the water gets sucked in. There's an impeller shaft where the white fan blade spins on that pulls in the water that gets full of hair. I use a pair of tweezers to pull it off the impeller shaft and everything is back to normal. I recently replaced the stock media pad with a Duracool media pad which I can clean out alot easier. I got the 30"" x 36"" a Home Depot and cut it into 4 pieces. The company, Essick Air, is American based and their customer service is very friendly and helpful. I recommend using 1 cup of white vinegar and would run it through for 1 hour to remove the swampy smell. That or switch to the Duracool media which is easier to clean off. Pros: Cools well as advertised. I see about a 15-20 degree difference between outside air temperature. Long lasting reservoir. Digital controls are easy to read and use. Easy to move around. I like the timer feature which I set at night. Once you start using one you wonder how you ever lived without one. Especially in Los Angeles, CA where it gets really dry and hot. Cons: Must clean reservoir about 1-2 times per month. It's a pain to have to empty the whole unit out and scrub it clean. I was cleaning off the media pad with Fantastik Scrubbing Bubbles to remove the algae/bacterial smell. It worked fine until the media pad just gave out. I panicked and looked around and found the Duracool which cost around $9 at Home Depot."|Positive
The Swamp Cooler works ok not the way I was expecting even though I add cold water on the tank and add the cooler gel pack the water is cold but the cooler doesn't send cool air as we expecting. We had an older version and it works a lot better than this one but I keep it at least the air is more cooler than the air coming from a regular fan of course I understand that is not an air conditioner.|Negative
I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't cool the entire house down. That could be because of the floorplan. I purchased this as a temporary way to cool the area down, which it does. It will work great in my garage. Called Customer service and and they were great. I had the part needed to do a horizontal mount shipped to me at no cost!|Positive
went on vent easily, and stopped all air movement completly-thanks!|Positive
I purchased this unit before it was called the current name from Home Depot in . Got it home installed in a Window with a cabinet door cut to fill in the window Opening and provide security for the install. Unit was bulky for one old guy (ME) to handle but used my hand truck to move it around and did the job. Purchased a faucet with the connector on side that had 1/4 inch male connector and used that with a 3/4 water hose gasket allowing attachment to the existing faucet.( Read That- No Plumbing Needed.) Unit runs all the time so I modified the unit with a Dial Evaporator Electrical Control ($35.00) by taking the switch on the front loose and wiring the Dial control to control the incoming power to go on and off depending on the temp setting on the Dial unit. There is a pump wire for control but I didn't bother with it. The existing switch will still turn the unit on and off and the Dial unit doesn't seem to mind if the unit still has power in to the control but the unit is turned off. After 2 years the pads were shot and I tried to find a company part replacement, but not readily available and too expensive. Modified the generic pads sold in H Depot ( Double the pads cut to size and install with Ty Wraps to the unit. Clean the unit annually with Calcium Lime Rust Product and put a little vinegar in water to get rid of any smells from setting. I use my unit with soft water and the only cleaning I do is the constant desert dust that turns to mud in the bottom over time. Wrote to company about the modification and got no response but, I see that the new unit has a remote control and some other features for $100 more. (5500) Dealt with the Aussies selling Disk Drives to them and found they are wonderful to do business with. Wonder What happen with company customer service ??? As with all things electrical around water unplug before any maintenance and show what American know-how can do with an almost OK product.|Positive
Works fine - use big pieces of ice along with cold water if you want it to blow cold, and not too big a room.|Positive
By far the cheapest replacements I found. Apparently, there are some that don't have the odor that these put out for the first couple of weeks, but I don't find it overpowering. Highly recommend!|Positive
GREAT FIT.|Positive
"We had the cooler professionally installed by our trusted A/C contractor. I highly recommend purchasing the purge pump. We had trouble with the water pump that came with the unit. It did not sufficiently pump enough water to wet the entire pad. A large area of the pad on the opposite side of the water line remained dry. My tech did all the suggested trouble shooting. I spoke to the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement pump that behaved the same way. My A/C tech purchased a ""contractor"" water pump (looks identical) with much wider propellar blades and the unit now works perfectly. The unit cools our 1100 sq foot house - no problem. We would recommend the unit but encourage the pump upgrade if you have similiar issue. Also, very excited how much our electric bill has dropped the first month of use. We should recover the cost of the unit and installation the first summer of use. Good luck!"|Positive
Size was almost perfect, had to do a little tucking here and there.|Positive
Best evaporative cooler ever. 3 inlets with cooling media and a great fan make the cold air come flying out of this thing. Good casters and a strong molded plastic body make it easy to move and very durable. Will last a long time. Also parts will be easy to replace if/when needed.|Positive
Great product for price works twice as good as your other brand portacool|Positive
I am very pleased with the cooler...It really cooled off my enclosed front porch & made it less humid so I can sit & relax without sweating which I was unable to do when it was very hot outside...In fact, a friend of mine was over & liked it so much she is going to purchase one!|Positive
The original one froze and I broke it cleaning it. It has lasted one season so far. This does require some time to install, for one has to take off the front panel to get to the connections. It did improve the evaporative cooler's effectiveness after all the other one was on its last legs.|Positive
Way noisier than we thought it would be. And the low setting is not very low. Blows papers around the office.|Negative
as of right now everything is working great easy to install came in on time|Positive
Exactly as described|Positive
Great little machine for cooling down a room in the summer. Remember there needs to be low humidity outside for it to work efficiently. Don't expect an air conditioner but it will cool down a room 5 to 8 degrees which usually is plenty. You can also use it outside. My only real complaint is the noise. Its fine when the water is full but sounds like a babbling brook when the level drops. I just turn up the TV a little and get through it.|Positive
The Portacool came out of the box, ready to use with minimum effort. Filled the tank with water, simple to use, easy to move around. Just what we needed to beat the Texas heat. 3 weeks of beating the heat, should have bought it last year.|Positive
Plugged in and it was awesome. Probably could have used the smaller one. Oh well.|Positive
This is a great evap cooler! I have used others in the past, but this model’s smaller dimensions make it easier to move around and it moves more air volume than larger units. Hessaire also has great customer service and went above & beyond with some slight damage that occurred during shipping.|Positive
Worked great, for three months IF that long. Product comes with a one year warranty-for one year I would expect to pay less than what the worthless item cost, I wont buy another one, and for being used at BEST a total of 2 to 3 times a week I really expected more. I wasted my money on something that is well not worth another look. Beware if you get one-they do not like to repair or fix these things and will hand you the run around.|Negative
This cooler does my whole house, works great and fairly quite|Positive
Didn’t do the job. Will be returning|Negative
This thing pushes some air! I have purchased similar products for twice the price that don’t work half as well. I use mine at an outdoor bar, and it keeps up.|Positive
Only lasted a season. Replaced pump thinking that would fix the problem of the water not going over coils. Wrong! Evven the manufacturer coudnt fix it.|Negative
i hope that this will help some one. (get a bigger unit) i got this about 3 months ago (this year 2010). and thought it would be a good idea. well this summer was not so hot in so.california. and when it did get really hot well it was unable to keep up with the heat. so i had to return it. it was not so bad on the other day that was not so hot, it was able to do a so so job. i am gonna have to get a larger unit with more water capacity and a stronger fan with greater CFM rating. this was rated at 700CFM but i am gonna be looking at the ones with at least 2000 CFM rating and that means that it will blow more air. and a larger water copacity. i hope this helped some one. (get a bigger unit)|Negative
You can tell that the temperature improves, but was not what I expected. If you plan on using outside only and not moving indoors could work. I was planning to use indoors as well ( upstairs), but was impossible considering the amount of water required to fill up the tank. There is no way to do it indoors and it gets very heavy.|Negative
It is wonderful! I can't use an ac in my bedroom, because of my windows but it cools my room down nicely!|Positive
First, we want satisfaction and peace of mind when buying a product and next we need to preserve their use. This swamp cooler, in the extreme heat of Las Vegas, provides my mobile home (12 by 60 ft) with a quiet and shooting cold breeze. I do choose the low speed. My suggestion would be to coat parts of the interior with a black spray avoiding rust. Mostly at the top of the panels where the water drips Do buy a copper line and you will not have to change the plastic ones every two or three years. Finally, grease the bearings of the wheel with adequate oil every month. The unit needs to be mantained well so to avoid rust like watching the dripping water not to be overflowing over the metallic side panels because after the painting is gone it will rust. Adjust the pads insideso the dropping water stays within them. Money well spend!|Positive
We were not sure unit would work in humid conditions. It does.|Positive
after being on for 2 hours, temp went up! Unhappy with performance.|Negative
Just what the Doctor ordered. Great cooler!|Positive
I did a great buy, It works good on my MasterCool. Easy to install.|Positive
100 percent|Positive
Very loud at high speed but did help cool the family room and kitchen noticeably on those really hot days. Pretty much a humid fan.|Positive
This type of cover holds up to the winds and adverse weather we have here in the Sierra's|Positive
We are starting to warm up here in AZ and I'm so glad to have this cooler! It cools the hottest part of our home fast, I love that its on wheels and I can move it to where I want it. Only drawbacks are its size and its a bit noisy, but I'll take that any day over being hot! Definitely worth the purchase!|Positive
work great but I am going to replace the rubber line with copper|Positive
This product is nice but big, it did not have a bad odor like I expected, and it was easy to set-up. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in the hot temperatures of Murrieta & Temecula, California. We set it up in the garage first to make sure it worked & didn't have a strong odor like many reviews stated. We were trying to use it to cool a 125sf upstairs bedroom since the house air conditioner doesn't cool upstairs very well. Unfortunately, it made it hotter & extremely humid so we returned it. We are using a portable air conditioner unit that needs vented through a window now. It works GREAT & it's a bit smaller than this air cooler. I gave it 3-stars because I think it could work well in the right climate but not for us. The directions about the water level marker were not very clear, so I suggest Honeywell add to them.|Negative
Good product. Cools well. A bit loud.|Positive
I just recently purchased the swamp cooler in May. Installed it into my horizontal sliding window. Hooked up the water line. Wet the pads and turned on the swamp cooler. It did the job and moved all the hot air out of my house. Kept the place cool. My house is 1554 sq ft. Swamp cooler is rated for 1600 sq ft.. Only bad thing is the instructions was not clear on the floater installation part. I wish there was a picture that demonstrated or displayed on the swamp cooler itself. But after a couple conversation with the maker in Arizona and some youtube videos on how to hook up the water line and floater. The brisa swamp cooler is working great. Its like night and day with the swamp cooler.|Positive
Easy ordering awesome price a slam dunk install. These pads last me 5 to 6 years and keep my power bill under $60.00 a month in the summer. Totally cool all the way around.|Positive
Great Product|Positive
CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THIS ONE... ALMOST TO COLD TO SIT IN THE SAME ROOM WHEN IT IS ON FULL BLAST !!!|Positive
First off, this won't work if you live in a really humid area. I live in an area that is usually dry, in the summer (Eastern side of near Central California, in the mountains). Today my inside thermostat reads 83 meanwhile it's 105 outside. This routinely brings my mid house temps down 20° from outside temperatures if I run it.on high and refill the water every 3hrs. On low, I can run it for 5hrs or so before needing to refill. I set it up on a timer if I'm gone from home so it doesn't run dry. The bedrooms which extend off the living room on either side are not cooled alot because this is a 500sq ft unit, and my home is close to 1400sq ft. They are however cooler than when this is not used. I also make sure to close drapes so sun isn't shining in directly, and open/close different windows during morning or afternoon to take advantage of where the cooler side of the house is. I chose an evap cooler over AC due to sheer costs of electricity.|Positive
No cover went on easily in the drawstring tie around the bottom it worked well|Positive
I purchased these covers to help protect my attic from the extreme cold and winter precipitation. The material seems to be very durable and the ease of installation was definitely a positive. My only complaint is that they had to be ordered online and had to wait to receive them because my local store does not stock them. Other than that, seems to be a great product!|Positive
Fits perectly, with enough give to fit over my power box & water connections without tearing on sharp corners. Good strong Velcro.|Positive
Assembly was a little harder if you have a sliding side by side window instead of a raise/lower window. So had to make some adjustments with plywood. It cools adequately for as hot as this year has been.|Positive
It is compact and does not stick way out of the window. It was easy to install and it looks good. Now I don't have to go on the roof any more to service the swamp cooler. It cools the whole house down and I have only used it on high once sense I installed it.|Positive
Only complaint is that the cooler pads on the sides are difficult to change since the side panels do not open and are not removable. Otherwise the unit works well.|Positive
This one may of been a dud. Fit and finish is fine. But an hour into running little puffs of blue smoke start coming out every half hour or so. I set pulley diameter for a 7.5A draw with an operating temp of 147 F at the hottest point internally and it still smokes a little. I called Dial for support twice but had to leave a message and no one ever returned a call. If these cooler was on my home I'd be exchanging it straight off but it's ground level in my shop so I can keep an eye on it. If it doesn't clear up I'll pull it and exchange.|Negative
Sturdy, more reliable than less expensive models.|Positive
fit well and is good|Positive
"Breezair cooler fan did not start up. Was making a periodic electrical humming noise, like an electric motor not starting. I checked to make sure that the control was giving it voltage. I was able to start the motor by hand by pulling on the belt during the humming period, but it soon died out. The motor has some kind of circuitry to cause it to cycle on and off if the motor is “overloaded”. But the old motor would not even start. So I suspected the motor was at fault. I bought this Dial 2-speed 3/4hp evaporative cooler motor. I measured all the dimensions from the old motor (A.O Smith, Frostline, hp ¾, rpm 1725, 1140. 115v. A 10.5/4.8. S# 320P532 Ser 2D96.) and they seemed to match, except that the Dial motor was advertised at 9.25 long and my motor was 9 7/16” long. But it turned out that this motor fit the old bracket exactly, and was also 9 7/16” long, so this spec was not advertised correctly. I also reused the old 3 1/2"" pulley and the old power cord, which has the same spade terminations. Spin the pulley by hand to make sure it doesn't rub against the motor. Really easy install."|Positive
Product sure took a long time to get here!!|Negative
I just wanted to let Hoe depot know that this item that my parents purchase for is a great time to have. I recently move and i live in an area that the temp rite is about hiugh 90' we try to save as much money as i can, and this is a great time to do it woth. I am a single parent of six children and i am the only income in the family i work hard to get things done for my family with any help. I just believe that your customer can read that this item is a great itwm to save money n energy.|Positive
Had my cooler for about a week now and I really like it. I live in a one bedroom apartment and it keeps it comfortable. The 3 gal water tank last just under 3 days on the lowest setting running all the time. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget. I used to keep my cooler next to an open window but the sound of traffic was annoying. Without it be next to an open window or door it still works very well!|Positive
New pads, a big improvement over the old [15+yrs] set, blows COLD air now. If this set of pads last as long as the previous set I will probably be long gone by the time they need replaced.|Positive
I bought this to use in my shop. We live in Burnet, Texas - Texas Hill Country. I know an evaporative cooler is not the best unit to use because of the humidity. I just wanted something that would cool the area in my shop where I was working. Well the unit has never made it to my shop. We have used in to provide a cool breeze on our patio. It works great. I think it is an exceptional cooler. I just hope my wife will let me take it to the shop someday. I agree with some of the reviews I read - the water level indicator could be improved but that is not a real issue with me. The operation manual and any other instructions were not included with the unit. I finally figured out how to get the base assembly out of the unit. The screws also were not included. The manual can be downloaded from Home Depot site. I am just glad I remembered seeing something about an operation manual on the information about the cooler. If you need something that works like it says it will buy this one. I believe it would cool a good size room in our home. If I had received it a couple of days earlier I could have found out since our air conditioner had a small problem that took me a day to fix. The temperature in Burnet was around 99 degrees.|Positive
The cover looks like it’s of good quality and the fit was perfect.|Positive
Works great on the patio. When the humidity gets above 73 then it’s more like just a fan. But the humidity doesn’t usually get the hi till about 7pm. Here in Houston. We use it a lot and it works great|Positive
The belt to spin the cage in the swamp cooler. Very good|Positive
Using this in Dallas, Texas. Temps have been in the mid to upper 90s. It has consistently blown out air that's between 80-82 degrees. It doesn't cool the whole shop, or even part of it, but if you keep it blowing directly on you it does the trick. Water tank requires refilling after 4-5hrs.|Positive
Need to be heavier material on large master coolers|Positive
I bought the Cooler for my tenant. It has worked great, and my tenant loves it.|Positive
This portable evaporative cooler is absolutely fantastic! I have nothing negative to say about the unit. If you're on the fence about making the purchase, don't be, you will not regret it.|Positive
I gave the 4 star rating base on what I expected from a portable cooling unit and my experience with my last portable cooler. The cooler is not designed to cool a large area or a whole house but cools the room and area around the cooler nicely. It does not drop the temp dramatically but does put out cooler air which helps keep the temp in the room from going up uncomfortably. Putting ice in the water holder and upper chamber does help with the cooling. It is a much quitter unit than my old one. It does help to crack a window or two for air flow.|Positive
Very easy to install|Positive
These pads were the manufactures recommended product and were the exact perfect sizes. Packaging was non existent and all 3 pads were just stuffed into a box causing lumps and bulges that will hopefully flatten over time.|Positive
This cooler is the real deal, I had to return some other ones. As you can guess by looking at the image, the whole back is a cooling pad. That means LOTS of cool air. Good wheels for rolling over most anything, and a nice handle for lifting it over things. This one is a winner all around.|Positive
the large one was what i originally wanted but finding it only came in 220 i settled for this one that was 110 power I find it does what it said and more, the product runes about 10-15 dollars a month to run so i would say i hit a home run all the way around purchasing this cooler|Positive
I have to set the timer to shut off in a couple of hours or I will get too cold at night... and this is July in the Southern US! The only drawback is I wish it actually had one slower speed on the fan. But that means if you have a large room, no worries!|Positive
very good|Positive
Just what I needed for for tying up stuff and the price was right.|Positive
Easy to install, fit like a glove.|Positive
Arrived a week before scheduled. Absolutley love this portable evaporative cooler.... Put water & ice and slept great!!! I used it for my bedroom, turned off Ac|Positive
I love that it's portable and it's great for small spaces and bedrooms!|Positive
Good product. I like the simplicity and the price was reasonable.|Positive
I had a problem with this at first and then after I installed it I took it out and figured out how to use it because it doesn't come with instructions. You have to pull it forward and tighten the screw and then you can adjust the float up or down using the notches. I thought it was a piece of junk until I figured that out.|Positive
the part came on time and worked as advertised i,m happy.|Positive
The set screws were missing from the fan to the pulley assembly so you would spin the pulley and the fan wouldn't spin had to make a second trip to Home Depot to buy set screws got that fixed went to put the motor on... the bolts were missing that keep the motor tension right... had to go to Home Depot again and buy the bolts for the motor tensioning. this this wasn't Home Depot's fault it's poor quality control at the factory|Negative
So far this product is excellant.................quiet and durable|Positive
This is my first experience with a portable evaporative cooler. I purchased it instead of putting up misters. The cooling from this unit is very localized—you pretty much have to be right in front of the airflow to get the affect. That may be true for all these types of units, however. So, FYI.|Positive
Bought the first one from Home Depot and it leaked and had no fan switch. Returned it for another. The second one has worked flawlessly so far. There's mostly negative reviews of this thing so I'm still skeptical. I use it in my home gym in my garage. I live in ABQ so 100' is the norm these days. I'll post an update in a week or two. Just remember to keep the water valve turned to the left so that the water drips down otherwise it's just an expensive fan. Also, my water meter is worthless on this one just like the first one. This is the reason for 4 stars. I didn't mark off for the first fan because it could've just been a lemon. After all this 2nd one is performing well so far. To be continued......|Positive
The extra thick pads I ordered fit my Mastercool 4800 perfectly. It even came with instructions and the Styrofoam filler pieces. One corner of one pad was a littler crushed from shipping. That is the only complaint.|Positive
fit perfectly|Positive
It arrived at the store earlier then promised and the associates at the service desk were great. The cooler is as I expected and does a good job.|Positive
Very happy works and is in order easy to install good price point|Positive
Going to return. It leaked all over the carpet. Wasnt holding the water.|Negative
This cooler was easy to put together and to install using a little common sense, but the instructions could be written better for beginners. For instance, the instructions and parts were inside the cooler, with no reference, outside the box or the cooler, of where they are and how to get to them. I used the chains and hooks it came with to set it up to the outside wall of the window. it came with everything needed.Works great! keeps the house between 70 and 75 when temperature outside is over 95. The cool breeze going through the house is awesome. we don't need to use floor fans anymore. I set it up on one end of the house and you can feel the breeze through the whole house by leaving a windows five inches open, in every room you want cooled. Plus, you have two speeds, High for a fast cool down, and low for a constant quite flow of cool air.|Positive
Works great, easy to install and great price.|Positive
The pads fit perfect. They will work great.|Positive
This Cooler puts out massive amounts of cool air. It has hit 106 here in N. Cali. and we stayed at a cool 80 degrees. The only con I have found is the amount of water it uses. Have to fill I every 2 hrs. Not sure about connecting it up to a hose directly as this cooler is indoors and it looks to me that the water gauge is slightly off, when it reads 1/2 it is about empty. Don't need a flood. Once you find a location to put it (as this is very important for the airflow) this cooler works like a champ. Not sure about the electricity cost, haven't had it long enough, but its just a fan and a water pump, can't use that much power. Overall I am very pleased with this cooler.|Positive
My kids love having this in the backyard.|Positive
Plastic screen on bottom of water pump was broken in three pieces when we unpackaged the unit.|Positive
Works well for what I have. I have a very small bedroom and live in a dry climate ( perfect for an crap cooler). Over 100 degrees it doesn’t work well but no evap cooler does. Worth the money|Positive
Pads are fine but a little too large for my cooler.|Positive
Fit fine, just what I needed to finish winterizing the swamp cooler.|Positive
Had to replace my 8 yr old metal Champion window unit, so went to HD. Saw that my store now carries the Bonaire window coolers. Sales associate said they are a better made unit than the Mastercool, and it looked like it to me. Easy install, and I have no doubt this cools better than my old comparable cfm unit. I have a thermostat on mine, and the Bonaire has a selector button where you can either use the remote, or manually turn it on and off. When it comes on, it doesn't stay running nearly as long as the old unit before reaching desired temps.|Positive
Motor died within 2 days on 2 units. Cheap plastic, poorly made motor. Never had one last more than a season, if it made it at all. HD really needs to offer quality choices in this product line.|Negative
By far the best quality and fit. Draw string is a little bit light weight but easy to up grade. Buy with confidence.|Positive
Nothing is worse than having the cooler pump go out during a heat wave, hubby came home from work and put this new one on and it works like a champ !! Happy happy.|Positive
Worked great AFTER I FIXED IT. It would not pump water out of all the orifices that soak the media with water. The hose they use from the pump to the water distribution manifolds collapses and cuts off the flow. I replaced it with non collapsing reinforced tubing and works great now. $5 fix|Positive
Dry climate evaporative cooler does cool the room a little. Problem is that it is extremely noisy. Like a bad hotel room AC that is constantly blowing.|Negative
"Good product, easy adjustable float is logically better than the cheaper ""bend the rod to fit"" model."|Positive
This is the third one of these that I have purchased. One had a problem with the pads, and Hessaire promptly sent me a new set. The only thing preventing me from giving this product 5 stars is that it has rather flimsy build quality, so installing the pads and covers can be frustrating. This is because the corners of the cabinet, where the ends of the pad covers hook in, has about the strength of a wet noodle. I wish there were some company that made a product like this that had about $100 better build quality, but that isn't the case. There isn't another product like this any where near this price range. It also seems that any of the products that are more money do not have the performance of this cooler.|Positive
Had a defective unit and received great help from Straton. I really appreciate the extra effort to keep customers coming back. Excellent product minus this issue. Would buy again. Thank you!|Positive
My air conditioner is old and doesn't pump out as cold of air as I would like. I opted for this instead of a standard fan. I LOVE IT. It blows nice cool air and at 3 different speeds. It really makes a big difference. The timer and remote are great for when I am in bed and do not want to get up to adjust. Super simple to put together and easy to refill. Has a year warranty which is a great bonus (haven't had to use it yet!) Ready for summer!|Positive
Simple enough installation, but very short lived. Installed last summer and used just over two months. Cooler drained and stored for winter. However, when installing cooler for this summer the pump was completely frozen. I've had pumps that would run free from season to season, have had a couple that froze but could be freed, oiled, and run well, but this one is hopeless. Definitely not built for a moist environment!|Negative
broken machine. it did not cool|Negative
It works well for my unit. Easy to setup out of the box, remove the tape, attach the wheels, add water and turn on. Keep adding ice for those real hot days and remember empty the water at least once a week so there is no bad water smell (just like cleaning the fish bowl)|Positive
I bought this pump in July and it only worked for 30 days! It did not keep the cooler pads wet enough. I have a Mastercool 6600 cooler and this pump was recommended by the store associate. Piece of junk, would not recommend to anyone. I have a clean machine on my cooler as well and the water has no build up or mineral deposits at all and this pump was worthless. Do not buy this pump.|Negative
Works well . . . when it works PROS: The rigid media used in this cooler is far superior to the aspen pads used in many other coolers. They provide a consistent performance and are easier to maintain. I have a Mastercool whole house unit on my house in Las Vegas and only use my AC when humidity gets too high (a couple weeks a year). The all plastic case is also a nice feature, as metal cabinets will invariably rust/corrode. The unit produces a temperature drop of 20-25 degrees in my conditions (5-20% humidity) Remote control for on/off, fan speed (not thermostatic) CONS: This cooler has a couple design flaws and has been fraught with problems since day one: Rather than a purge cycle, the pump continuously drains a portion of it’s flow. Considering Evaporative coolers work best in hot, dry climates, where water waste is not an option.(a separate purge pump can be perchased and operated on a programmable frequency $50) There is no way to direct the airflow from the cooler (grille is fixed) The lower screws that attach the filter assembly/cover to the unit allow water to constantly drip. Maybe a simple sealing job, but I’ve had to remove the cover so many times I haven’t wanted to use silicone (yet) The water level float valve was not “plug and play,” requiring several adjustments to get the shut off to occur at the correct level. The water depth needs to be precise as the operating level between pump starvation and overflow is slight. The valve is a inexpensive part and not very precise. Adjustment is made by bending the float arm. My valve required several adjustments, requiring several removals of the back filter assembly/cover. The unit is designed for sash type windows. It will fit in horizontal sliders, but then you must make your own baffles to seal the window. The supplied kit only works for windows that open vertically. Operational Flaw My cooler also has an operational flaw. At a somewhat random frequency (2-8hrs) the pump shuts off while the fan continues to run. In no time the pad goes dry, and I’m blowing 3200cfm 105F air into my house! Essick/Mastercool was responsive and sent me a new controller, and a new fan motor (old fan is not compatible with new controller). That’s great, kudos to customer service, but I still have to take the fron & back off the unit and install the new parts. Not something for less than an experience do-it-yourselfer or pro. So DO NOT BUY unless you are above average in DIY, and are prepared to fine tune it to get it right. I think that the optional purge pump kit is a must (also requires DIY skills), and be prepared to replace parts if yours also has issues. Once you get it dialed in, it performs well, and the plastic will never rust.|Negative
While the purchase and price of this unit was very good, we were told at the store that we would receive three estimates for installation. We received only one estimate and to say the least it was quite a shock as to the amount being quoted for installation. The unit itself cost approximately $450, the estimate for installation was $1,050. More than double the cost of the unit. The installer advised that their company charged their cost and Home Depot had to get their cut. Really, you received the purchase price of the unit. Very disappointed in this aspect of the purchase. We installed the unit ourselves, and am sure that any time of warranty for the unit will be void.|Positive
Works well in our dry climate.|Positive
Was not as advertised. Does not cool a small garage area adequately.|Negative
I purchased this motor to replace the motor I installed last year. The old motor developed a loud squeal at start up, that would go away after about a minute of running. After a couple of weeks running this new motor, it's now having the same issue.|Negative
its really good and strong fan|Positive
This unit works good and moves a lot of air, but the plastic housing is not very durable. A couple clips were already broken when first opened. I would expect more from an outdoor portable unit.|Negative
Excellent product. Just what I was looking for.|Positive
Works great for my homemade grain mill. delivery was long but as listed.|Positive
great equipment purchase|Positive
Works fine. A little loud, but keeps our well-insulated 1,000 sq ft house @ 75 degrees in 98 degree heat in the high, dry desert of southern UT.|Positive
Great service. The OEM pads our way superior to any other off market pads Home Depot at great prices and their delivery was awesome|Positive
The unit works great, we are glad we made this purchase.|Positive
Didn't perform as well as I would have liked. I would not recommend this product.|Negative
We purchased this cooler/humidifier for purpose of adding moisture to the air in our house as we live in a very dry climate. It has worked day and night for almost three years now. I am actually very surprised as we have other models before that can't handle our hard water. I thought for sure it would only last a year or so. I have taken it apart twice now for a super-cleaning and are now on my 6th filter as our water is tough on them. Every two months, I descale the filters with a commercial de-scaler and they hold up well. It's a great product.|Positive
Great service|Positive
I bought this pump in March, 2015 and it lasted through summer. I turned on the evaporative cooler in January 2016 and the pump motor was dead. It was not seized, but would not spin when it was plugged in. Home Depot only shows a 90 day warranty for this unreliable pump, so I guess it goes to the landfill. Do yourself a favor and buy a different pump than I did or you might be writing a negative review too.|Negative
I use it as a pool water level fill valve. Stainless steel would last longer, but this is fine for the price.|Positive
This cooler/tower fan is absolutely amazing. I love the evaporative setting but I have found myself using the tower fan more. I prefer my room at night to be quiet and this product definitely is. With the evaporative feature, it has made a difference in the temperature of my room the few times I have used it. The directions are pretty simple and straight to the point. The product itself may be huge in size but it does its job plus some. The tank for the evaporative part is also easy to fill. I would totally recommend this product to a friend or family member.|Positive
It was exactly what I wanted to replace the old pad|Positive
Have ordered in the past. We are managers of a mobile home park and this item is frequently requested over time when they need to be replaced.|Positive
Happy with it in my garage|Positive
nice, well made unit. I'm using it in the garage.|Positive
Mesh is a little too fine. Gets clogged too quick.|Positive
Works well in dry climates. I've had no issues with product. Handles would have been a big plus. Uniit looks cheap with flimsy plastic. Would purchase again.|Positive
Works Very GOOD today is a hot summer day. It is 108 outside and this Honeywell 1540 has the indoor temp at a 78 the humidity level outside is 10. Works very good we had it outside for fathers day in the backyard and worked great.|Positive
After third day of use, completely shut off and won't turn back on! Wast of time and money and will be returning it!|Negative
A little hard to put up. Not made as good as I thought it would be. Works great.|Positive
I purchased the unit for cooling our glass green house. I run on low speed which keeps the glass 10' x 12' green house at or below outdoor temperature which I feel is pretty good. It looks great and makes mowing around green house easy do to slim profile and no special bracing required. By running on low to medium speed the unit is very quite which has satisfied my unhappy neighbors with their porch about 20 feet behind the cooler. I feel it is much quieter than the older style original box coolers. I was disappointed to find the model sent does not have the separate purge pump as per the data online about the cooler. It still requires the continues bleeder instead of a pump out once every 6 hours which I had planned for in my waste line to prevent soft ground around the back of the green house. Also disappointed that during a power outage the unit does not return to the run state prior to the power outage. You have to push the power button to get it to come back on which is bad for a green house seeing how you may not be around when the power outage occurs. I will have to rewire so that it will come on automatically. I'm happy I bought it for my green house.|Positive
This is an excellent product. Would recommend it to others. Thank you Home Depot!|Positive
Wish it would have cooled off a little better. Smelled like cardboard for several days. It works as long as we leave the doors open from the house and mix the Ac from the house to help blow the air around.|Negative
Easy to install, and does a great job of cooling off our house. Keep in mind, we installed this downstairs on a 2-story, 2,700 square foot house and even the bedroom farthest from the cooler is cooled off. Once we got the float figured out, we've been good to go and all is great. Highly Recommend!|Positive
We bought this for our son's college dorm. Tested it out at our home and it didn't seem to make a difference. We returned it and bought a portable air conditioner. We do not live in a low humidity area so that may have been part of the issue.|Negative
Loud but MOVES AIR !!!!!|Positive
We purchased the Champion 500-CFM 2-speed Window Evaporative Cooler for 1600 sq. ft (with remote control). It works better then expected. Our home is a little over 2000 sq. ft., (two story), and you can feel the coolness throughout the house. It works so well my husband will put on a stocking cap to keep his head warm. When it's about 75 to 80 degrees in the house, once we turn the cooler on, the temp drops to a nice cool comfortable range within minutes, not hours. This is our first and we are so thankful for making this purchase, we have nor regrets. On the down side.There was some damage noticeable to the top of the cooler, from shipping but was compensated. Staying Cool in NV.|Positive
Worked fine for a day or so then failed. Del time was rediculous! Amazon has a much shorter del time about the same price. Used a different motor this time due to time factor and hopfully a better motor!|Negative
The fan doesn't push much air at all, you can't feel any cool air unless your face is directly in the front of the fan. Save yourself time on having to return this portable evap cooler, don't buy it.|Negative
"The pads were labeled with a ""top"" and ""direction of airflow,"" which my old pads did not have. This ensured that the pads were installed correctly. The only downside is that the evaporative cooler still only takes 15 degrees off the outside temperature, in spite of being rated for a much larger house than mine."|Positive
Very handy relaxing on my patio|Positive
Very easy to use and really cools the air. Plan to buy another smaller unit.|Positive
I am very impressed with the quality of Brian's cover products. Nice thick quality. I expected just tiedown loops on side seam, but was thrilled to have Velcro. This allowed the cover to seal around the electrical and water supply lines, making a quick cover up and sealing of the unwanted moisture ingress during winter storms. The product was exactly what I wanted and have modified other covers to create. Thanks for creating a product with the customer in mind|Positive
This cooler effectively cools the interior of an RV parked in the sun more economically than the built in AC. The compact size and small footprint help with placement. The remote works well but the unit does not remember the settings prior to power off - the settings have to be manually restored. The remote is fine for turning the unit off. The fan is almost silent at low speed, high is audible, but not unpleasant.|Positive
We took the box apart to remove the cooler first thing we noticed the top was damaged . second thing trying to get the panels off were difficult due to the screws all being over torqued and stripped they would just spin ..it doesnt come with any hardware to anchor it to the roof top.. we used the 3/4 horse motor and the unit is very noisy ....|Positive
Works great, my house is nice & cool|Positive
"This is the second Arctic Cove 500 CFM 3 speed Portable Evaporative Cooler that I've bought. The first one lasted 4 years with heavy usage. I really like the type of filter it uses--I'm not sure what it's called but it (and the screen) is easy to remove, to clean, and very effective at cooling my bedroom. During the winter I have often used just the fan portion for air circulation--the fan is powerful but quiet and has a choice of 3 speeds. Air flow can be set for one direction, or by pressing ""Swing"" the vertical louvers will automatically move side to side. About the only flaw is the ""sight glass""--can't really tell the water level by looking through it, as it's tiny, low to the ground, & not very clear. But just glance through the water access door and you can see the water level."|Positive
pump is questionable sometimes but cools great!!|Positive
Just another fan|Negative
The Aspen Pad set is well made. Works great.|Positive
Arrived timely and product was just as advertised. Perfect fit. I also ordered the straps because it can get windy. They are high quality and look like they will hold up to winter weather. Winter is coming.|Positive
Great float. The adjustable arm is a lot easier to adjust than having to try and bend the cheaper style.|Positive
Purchased this to keep my bedroom cool at night during the hot months. It's not an extreme cold, but serves its purpose and keeps the room a nice sleeping temperature. Easy to use, great evaporative cooler!|Positive
Received today and return today....Beware this is not 2100 CFM, for 700 sq. ft. Outside of box reads 1,000 for 400 sq. ft.|Negative
One of the Universal Rigid Medias was dented/crushed in places which the other one was perfect.|Negative
Unfortunately, it wasn't able to work for me in Los Angeles. It would make the room feel colder for about 5 minutes and then make it feel like an actual swamp: warm and humid. I ended up returning it.|Negative
Great solution if you are using it properly for a small area.|Positive
I had Up-Dux installed in some of the rooms when I had a new swamp cooler installed. They get the job done very well as far as air circulation is concerned, & blowing cool air up into the attic rather than out a window should help a lot when the hot weather comes. But.. be forewarned that the spring loading of the trap doors make them open& slam shut with the slightest movement of air. Here in the desert, we have a lot of afternoon winds & the Up-Dux can be annoying at times. Of course this doesn't happen if the cooler is running. but, if it's off, they can get a little noisy.|Negative
I needed a product that would cool our tailgating tent in Arizona during football games and sports games. This works perfectly! Not only was it easy to take with us, it was no mess and easy to set up. People were very appreciative to have it in the heat! Thank you from our tailgating crew!|Positive
Unbelievable cool and easygoing|Positive
This thing turned out to be an expensive Fan. I could hear the evaporative pump was working, but there must have been a faulty connection inside, as the Unit wouldn't humidify the air. I ran the Unit on high, in 100 degree Arizona heat for 4 hours. There was no sign of water loss from the Reservoir. I returned the hot air blaster.|Negative
Usually doesn't last a full season but when it's new it works great|Positive
Doesn't blow much air. Sometimes doesn't turn on , if U have used it for couple of hours before.|Negative
this was a warranty replacement for the same kind. the first one went bad in six months and this one was bad right out of the box. i bought a different brand that works fine.|Negative
Excellent, Outstanding performance. Being used in a 100 degree, dry, 12*15 roof covered patio enclosed on 3 sides. Thank you.|Positive
This thing moves a lot of air! I've been running it for a month now; so far so good. I just have it sticking through a window; so I can take it down after the hot/dry summer months. Even as a temp/seasonal fix, it doesn't look too bad.|Positive
Works great. I bought 3 of them for a warehouse. Heat gets up to 108 sometimes and these work great for my employees and keeps them cool. I had them shipped to my business and all 3 arrived in excellent condition.|Positive
The pump was easy to install and the flow of water pumped is great my cooler works wonderful thanks to this very efficient pump|Positive
Got the swamp cooler and opened box, immediately opened inside and there are cracks in the pan - so far the water is not leaking. I needed it so badly that I didn't want to send it back because the temps are 110 degrees right now. It is helping keep the place cool, but I worry that the cracks in the pan will start leaking. I will need to replace it within the 90 days.|Negative
Absolutely no power, had to return it. Tried all trouble shooting tips.|Negative
It’s a really cute expensive fan.|Negative
Works better than I had hoped.. kinda pricy for its simplicity though|Positive
Easy to set up. Cools small areas (10x10) extremely well.|Positive
This installed easily and works great. The house has never been more comfortable.|Positive
Works great for a small area|Positive
Received product, filled the reservoir with the water plugged in and let it run. In less than 30 minutes the humidity level I required to operate at in my business was were we needed to be. Now we turn it on when humidity is down to 45% and turn it off when we hit 58-65%. So much better than the previous two we purchased.|Positive
An excellent design,however,it's lowest speed setting is higher than my last cooler's highest setting. IMO,the low setting should be lower than the existing one. It uses a lot of water but this indicates the water is evaporating,thus providing cool air.|Positive
Worst purchase , did not cool much in a 10x10 room.|Negative
I have bought better cooler grilles from Home Depot in the past. On this particular one the louvers have a tendency to come off when adjusting them, however it is easy to snap them back on.|Negative
Excellent pads for an excellent evap cooler|Positive
great for our mastercool unit|Positive
Ready to use right out of the box. Does not work well in hot environments, acts just like a high speed fan moving hot air around. I bought it for my standard size 2 car garage and after 3 hours of running the temperature only dropped 5 degrees.|Negative
easy to install and works great|Positive
Great quality canvas oiled for durability !|Positive
I buy two of these as I use two on my house and the last ones lasted 35 years with proper maintenance. I should be gone by the time these need to be replaced LOL!|Positive
bought to replace motor on Swampy. motor will not start cooler fan. slow to start and very weak. I returned the motor and got a second motor. same problem both in half horse and three quarter horse. found some other reviews about the new dial brand motor and confirms what I know now junk!!! had to buy a century motor on Amazon. the Amazon motor works great.|Negative
Wrong pads. Store no longer carries the cooler so trying to figure out which pad we needed with assistance of employee was difficult. We made the pad work.|Negative
Works good with a few exceptions Soft plastic construction. Even with care it sceasily scuffed. Hose hookup is bad design. I’m adding a 90 to help protect the fitting. On high lots of noise and moisture.|Positive
Our portable evaporative cooler is a nice, energy efficient alternative way to sleep cool on exceptionally hot nights, and it provides welcome humidity. It is not silent, but the sound is pleasant and does not interfere with sleep.|Positive
I have it about 2 weeks, so far works wonderfully, cools my bedroom enough so I actually get cold, I do have whole house air conditioning, but upstairs bedrooms get very hot. I hope it continues to work as well all summer. No problems so far|Positive
I’ve had my Cooler for 2 years and it does a great job when summer temperatures get to high for my Snake collection in our garage. The wife does not allow snakes in her home and our garage is not air conditioned so in the hot months use my unit to keep my animals safe and comfortable!|Positive
It does a pretty good job on our house in Denver, Colorado. It came with a bit of damage. A new grill was sent out promptly to replace the damaged one, though the replacement was missing pieces. So, now I have to combine the two grills to get one good one.|Positive
Great portable design that earned a star - wish that it was constructed with as much care! Mine lasted 3 days of use at about 3 hours per use and then the fan would only run on low speed. I am returning to try a different product. Waste of time and money.|Negative
Won't cool 600 sq ft as stated, but does a nice job for about 400|Positive
Seems to be working well|Positive
The cooler looked pretty good before unwrapping it. The top had a dent in it and two louvered side panel were bent. That was the outside. I had to disassemble the unit to move it to my roof. It was shocking to find nicks and dents, as well as scratches. Also the individual parts don't seem to fit together properly and are fulled together by the shrews. The base assembly which holds the water has an 8 year rust warranty. All other components, especially the unprotected sheet metal screws, nuts & bolts (stainless steel parts are not used) will rust away well before the warranty of the base assembly will run out. Some areas near the motor-mount did get painted after assembly, leaving some parts with only a faint coat of paint. The unit seems to function o.k. (in used it for 2 weeks so far), but the quality and the craftsmanship are poor. I am not sure that I can recommend the Champion Cooler.|Negative
it worked but its expensive for a little valve that goes bad in a year or so|Positive
I was looking for an alternative to a traditional air conditioner and this did the trick. Easy to use, looks great and kept me cool. Thanks newair! Topanga J|Positive
We love it! It is light and easy to move around. The oscillating fan feature is wonderful. The heat here in Texas is brutal so it's nice to have a little breeze while doing projects outside-even if it's man made.|Positive
Makes cooling your house effortlessly with very little thought or input. SUGGEST you use Up-Dux vents so that you won’t need to open windows to get the whole house cool. Has function to pre-wet the pads with the cooler pump before the fan kicks on so you never pull air over a dry pad.|Positive
Since we have installed the swap cooler, we've only had the ac on twice. So glad we got this and wish we had done it sooner!!|Positive
First off, tried it in the bedroom so it would cool off before I went to sleep. Had to turn the tv volume up so loud that I worried about the neighbors hearing my tv blasting. Left the window open as recommended but, after an hour - it was so humid - I felt like I was in Florida. Next day - tried it in the living room. Now I know my living room is bigger than the 320 sq ft that this unit is recommended for. But still - it did nothing. I actually left for about an hour - when I came back - it was so humid when i walked in the door - it was miserable. All in all I let it run for about 3hrs - I didn't notice an ounce of coolness - UNLESS I was sitting in front of it - like the video shows on Youtube. Honestly thinking about returning it. But I tossed the box because I so sure it was going to be just what I was looking for. Disappointed so far.|Negative
It does the job for me. Shipping time was good. Easy to use.|Positive
The Luma was delivered quickly. There was no setup other than plugging it in. This unit was so easy to fill and operate. I have been using it daily. I either use the swing fan to simply move the air or when I want a bit more chill, I use the cool function. I love it's portability with the hand holds and the casters. I felt it was so easy to operate, I ended up buying a second one for a friends elderly parents home.|Positive
Ordered the cooler cover, received it faster than expected the fit was perfect, no problems.|Positive
Just like the other pads|Positive
Works perfect for patio or garage on a hot day|Positive
This cooler feels solid and made of quality metal. Put together well and feels solid and strong. This is a replacement cooler for one that was similar in design and weight. That cooler lasted about 7 to 8 years with min. care. I would expect this cooler to also last as long by looking at the design and materials used to make it.|Positive
in a warm area, but it can't handle Las Vegas, nv|Positive
Excellent service for an excellent product!!! Will order again.|Positive
The cooler was delivered quicker than expected. I use it while I’m working in my garage. It cools my garage down enough to make it bearable when it 110 degrees outside in the Arizona desert. However, you need good airflow for it to work properly. It will not cool down my garage with the doors closed, it will just make the garage humid.|Positive
The remote doesn't work. Cools well, but not quite as expected.|Positive
works great. is a bit loud, but not that bad|Positive
Arrived quickly and in perfect shape! Can't wait to use this next summer.|Positive
Easy to install. Holding up well through our recent winds.|Positive
Product is fine but my water is too hard for it to last more than about 3 years even with a bleed.|Negative
This was an exact replacement of the unit that fried. Replacing it worried me greatly, I thought I might need an electrician, but there are just three wires and once the power was off (and I cleaned up the fried wiring) it went in very easily. Since the last unit truly fried, I am concerned about longevity. The old unit was in the home when we purchased so I have no idea if it was in for 2 years or 7 years (when the cooling system was installed by the previous owner).|Positive
It only worked 2 times then it didn’t work anymore returned it to the store and would not buy this product again|Negative
I purchased this on line for store pick up at my local store so i could save time. I also purchased other items to install this as it would be a whole new install. The only thing is... some of these items came with the cooler so now i have too take them back. NO WHERE in the online PDF manual is there a parts list of items that would come with the cooler. For instance, it came with: Motor Brackets, Motor Electric Cord, Water Pump, Aspen Pads, Cooler Bleed Off, Float with Valve, Motor Pulley... i purchased all these separately cause i did not see it in the instructions on line. Now i have to take them all back. I didn't know it was going to come with these items, I ordered a motor kit that came with the motor, cord and brackets and had to wait a week for them.... for nothing. Hence, the instructions could have been better. Over all, i am happy with the Champion brand as i have three coolers YES 3 in my house. Just do a little more research than i did if you purchase one to save time and money. Call Champion if you have to for clarification or go to the store itself.|Positive
I am sitting in the cool, damp air of my new swamp cooler as I write this, so my review may seem a bit biased. this unit is pretty great. looks to be more resistant to rust than the similar models i've worked on for years. zero stripped out bolts, everything was as good as it could be on this model straight from the floor of home depot. did a retrofit installation on my own with relative ease. did call in my electrician to install the pump/motor wiring and switch. if the electricity and ducting are not already in place, these will be two added costs to the sticker price. this unit is quiet as can be even on high. it keeps our 1100 sq ft upper story cool on low even when it's 90 out. it has exceeded our expectations.|Positive
Bearing noise so loud couldn't run the motor any longer...about to fail. Home Depot sent me to mfg. for replacement.|Negative
Perfect for the area I live in, I like that you can put ice water in it. It exceeded all my expectations. And I have told all my friends about it|Positive
love the stylish look it has, and it has worked to keep my room at a nice 75 degress|Positive
These were exactly what I expected and they work very well. I am really pleased with this purchase.|Positive
works like a champ! much better power than original one that gave up in these triple digit heats!|Positive
over heats, can break down easily, hard to install, plain not easy to deal with.|Negative
This cover appears to be made of sturdy material and will most likely last more than one winter. I bought this for my AC unit. I like that it is open at the back. It does not interfere with the AC lines.|Positive
I was pleased how well this water cooler worked. It does take a lot of water, but I like the unit. I love that I can roll it anywhere I want the cool air.|Positive
Well built, cools the house quickly, but it is loud...but, I would buy another, if needed.|Positive
The unit appears well built and the price was great. Although the install kit was missing two of the brass fitting pieces to hook the water line up with. Perhaps this was a previous product return and Home Depot did not do a full inspection, so it cost me another trip for parts. Because of this I recommend looking at the baggie of parts while at the store and make sure that all the brass is there.|Positive
Very nice unit coupled with my AC cools the house very nicely|Positive
This is great for cooling a small to medium sized room. Works best when ice is added to the water.|Positive
The fan/cooler works great.It is well designed and easy to use.|Positive
Nice product.|Positive
Simple solution to keeping cover on in high wind, especially after the low quality cord that came with the cover breaks. I also plan to use it to bundle the cover in the summer time.|Positive
It is waterproof - for now. I do believe they coated it with some material to make it water proof. It felt a bit damp coming out of the plastic when I first got it. But so far it has held up to the elements. Water beaded up and rolled off when it rained. But is not stain resistant and will get discolored over time. Bottom line is it will get the job done of protecting your evap cooler. Will repost a review after another 11 months.|Positive
They went on as advertised, ugly yellow color. I would have preferred a white color. If they are as the yellow cooler covers that I used in the past the AZ sun will cook them in a couple of years. Time will tell if they will last very long??|Positive
Fit fine. Was good quality.|Positive
Rather than cooling the room in which it was placed, the cooler created a swamp-like atmosphere - hot with very high humidity. My glasses actually steamed up when I walked into the room. A simple fan works much more effectively than this product.|Negative
perfect replacement motor,for old motor,also seems the cooler cools better,than old motor did,i made the perfect choice.|Positive
This product is very ordinary, however I wish to say I enjoy using the Home Depot Internet site for building supplies that I can purchase online. I like the home delivery but the store pickup gives me the opportunity to purchase any extras I need. I've always enjoyed the great prices on materials that I have purchased from Home Depot over the years of building several homes.|Positive
Purchased this air cooler for a small bedroom and it works really well. I needed a replacement for an air conditioner that was just plain ugly and wanted the window to be free of any obstructions. Love that it is portable and easy to use. It definitely was worth the price , So so happy about this product.|Positive
This unit is a Monster of a Unit, It’s compact and yet packs a powerful blast of cooling with a special winged prop and three panels of high-density rigid media. This device came with caster wheels for easy mobility around the house ( I chose not to use them), oscillating louvers to cover a wide area. In addition manual controls make it easy for you to adjust between the fan settings, and pump setting to obtain optimal cooling, did I mention the 10 gal water capacity. I had the CFM 850 and loved it and decided to upgrade to the bigger unit, which is just as efficient but has a lot more airflow by comparison. I placed this unit in front of an open window behind it and with the front door open next to it (see pic below), in addition I open windows on the opposite side of the house. As it was a 100 outside, it was a comfortable 73 inside. * * * * * High Recommended in dry climates * * * * *|Positive
Great, high quality coated canvas. Fits like a glove. Reusable for next year.|Positive
product works great but needs a float system for auto water refill to be great for desert use.|Positive
WENT THRU AUGUST WITH TEMPS VERY HIGH AND UNIT WORKED VERY WE;LL.. WOULD RECOMMEND STRONGLY. FOR THE PRICE YOU CANT BEAT.|Positive
Granted I don't have it set up according to instructions. I live in the desert so the idea of opening a window for air flow when it's triple digits outside doesn't appeal to me. With water, the unit does cool the room down a little but mostly it just smells bad. It works great as a fan though.|Negative
No option to connect to timer|Negative
Works great, we use it in our garage and it makes a big difference.|Positive
Works perfectly! Good pricing.|Positive
Installed 3 ofthese about 6 months ago. I have a 1500 sqft house and a 2 sided window mastercool. Once i modified the cooler to blow 30°cooler air,the ducts really shined. The ducts blow air through my small crawl space ( can't even Call it an attict) and into the garage ceiling. Air vents out garage door/ window so basically the entire house/ garage gets cooled down because of the ducts. Ceiling is 10° to 15° cooler throughout the house. Yesterday it was 95°. House stayed 70° and garage stayed 76°. Ceilings were all 74° to 76° compared to 85° - 93°. I'm Going to purchase 2 more of these for the house. Possibly going in each bathroom|Positive
The filters were relatively easy to install. Fit well.|Positive
The affect is much better than just a regular oscillating fan. It has been our savior through these scorching heat waves.|Positive
good motor|Positive
package broken on bottom when delivered ,retaining clips were missing. luckily was able to salvage old ones. next time I will pick up at store so I can identify missing parts.|Negative
It fit perfectly, tough, high grade canvas. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high grade cover. The price was lower than I thought I would have to pay for a cover of that quality.|Positive
"I had never had to replace the blower shaft in my swamp cooler before, so this was a new experience for me. The shaft was longer than I needed and I was concerned that it would have a ""flat"" end on both ends, but it was on just one end. This allowed me to cut off the end without the ""flat"" and then I had the perfect size for my cooler. The piece was a good quality and I believe it should last a good long time. Maybe not almost 20 years like the original, but nothing lasts that long anymore! Hahahaha!!!"|Positive
pretty much what it was supposed to do. love it, especially when I add ice cubes to the water trough!|Positive
Reviews said that these fans work best under 50% humidity. Humidity in Oklahoma is in the high 40%'s so hasn't worked to cool as well as I had hoped. It does operate well so my mistake, not theirs.|Positive
no after waiting 2 weeks for the ac it was dented really badly I did not except it. got one somewhere else.|Negative
"on the wires all the common wire were hooked to each there was no wire for me to wire my common wire to so I had to put a pig tail in for the common. on one leg of the 230 one wire was to short had to lengthen it. I changed the pillow block bearing to some sealed ones that you don't have to oil or grease . the flush pump was plugged into the pump plug. so I had to switch the two. both pumps are the same so it didn't matter. It took me two weekends to install but I had to change the duck work ,cooler jack and build a 2"" square cooler stand 52"" X 42"" but I did it right after testing worked good I'm ready for summer."|Positive
Tore as soon as my Son put it on.|Negative
No assembly required. Works great! Nice cool breeze plus adds humidity to the air!|Positive
Works great. Fits great.|Positive
It is a littler plastic than I would have liked but it won't rust and it does the job|Positive
ok|Positive
Keeps me comfortable in garage during AZ summer while working on projects. Works great.|Positive
Good price, good product, works well.|Positive
Recently had this model installed by Home Depot. I am very happy with how the entire process, except for the City of Albuq. permit process, whom I am waiting for as I type this and have been waiting all day. Expect another day off for the final inspection. Delta Mechanical was the contractor that did the install and they were terrific!! From the estimate to the next day install every one of the guys were outstanding. When the project was completed, you couldn't tell that they had been there, except for the new unit. Everything to the last wire casing was cleaned up before they left. The unit itself is working GREAT!! I can already tell the difference in the cooling of this unit compared to the old swamp cooler that was only 5-6 years old. I'll know more once the heat of summer hits and I get an electric bill or 2 for any cost savings. Thanks again Delta and Home Depot! Job Well Done.|Positive
Seems to cool OK. Uses only 100 Watt of power. Not too noisy.|Positive
Set up to get the unit into operation was easy and simple. The unit appears to be doing a very good job of cooling.....still testing any differences in fan speed level and cooling output levels. Did have the unpleasant odor as others have described but it was short time issue and went away quickly. The unit is lightweight, it is all plastic...the only metal portion is the wheel casters. It has excellent fan speeds. We are using it in a enclosed sun room; venting through two doors(intake and exhaust). Humidity level may be elevated in the morning but it cools the 400 sqft area effectively.|Positive
I am very saddened with this product. It works like a simple $20.00 fan. The 5 scores/stars it was given is highly misleading. I regret having purchasedi it.|Negative
This is junk, it doesn't make anything cooler it makes it hotter and puts hot humidity in the air and Runs Out of Water too fast I put ice cubes in it,I put cold water from the frigerator inside of it and i have it right by a screen door like your suppose to and it does not cool the room at all! I'm returning it as soon as possible. You don't believe me then go ahead and buy it, save your receipt you can return it and use it for up to 90 days.|Negative
Cools better than just a fan, does run somewhat noisy For the price I like it I bought two of them keeps my upstairs Comfortable I keep them running with the windows closed before the heat pours in I find this really helps keep cool, adds humidity as well.|Positive
We purchased it to use at night while using our air conditioner during the day when it's over 100. So far we are very happy with it.|Positive
Very easy to assemble and very inexpensive. Its getting the job done and keeping my family cool during these hot summer days.|Positive
This size portable cooler is a life saver in our enclosed porch.|Positive
Seems to be working just fine. Its 103 outside and cool inside.|Positive
It wasn't as efficient as I thought it would be. it was no different than a fan. After 2 weeks of use, it broke and the water spilled everywhere. I do not recommend it at all.|Negative
Just bought the cooler motor it's easy to install works well but like everyone else said it does hum or have a buzzing noise I can't say how long it will work because just bought the motor and a belt for the cooler there was no modifications that had to be done to install the motor|Positive
Love the way it fits on my wall, cools exceptionally well. Easy installation and set up.|Positive
Oscillation speed is not adjustable. Also if you turn it off you need to make sure the blades face center or it'll continue to blow in whatever direction it stops. Lastly, each setting needs to be turned off individually or it will continue to run the diff settings. Otherwise it does the job perfect|Positive
Very disgusted that it didn't come with the pieces needed to hook up my poly supply line (only pieces for copper supply line included). And the directions even have the nerve to show the hookup/installation of the parts they didn't include (the ferrule and little tube part), but make no mention that they aren't included so I am looking around thinking, did I spill/lose something from the bag?? For an extra penny those parts should have been included. Poly supply line is about as prevalent as copper is. Now I have to make another trip to the hardware store!|Negative
Fit is good, closure is tight. Seems to be well made.|Positive
Works great for my shop. Highly recommended. Will Cool down your whole shop even though it's 1000 square feet.|Positive
I have an older breeze air cooler. I had to trim the media a little, no big deal. They stunk for about a week but eventually that went away. All is well now.|Negative
A little something the safety / manual does not mention - upon the first time filling the water tank, the water level indicator might stick in the low position. So while filling it with water, one should jostle the unit to free up the indicator to avoid over filling the tank. You do not want to over fill the tank. This results in water all over the floor, then streamed along the path to the outdoor patio so one might pull the drainage plug, which is located under the unit, towards the back center. Upon re-entering the house, remember there has been water spread willy-nilly all over the floor, in a distressed state one might forget this hazard, resulting in an embarrassing fall head over tuckus onto the floor. Other than that, the machine works sufficiently enough to keep my snubbed nose pups cool.|Positive
Picked this unit since the dimensions fit our window. We've had it for a couple weeks so far. It seems to be a good replacement for our old unit. It is much quiter than the old unit. We also like that you can move the louvers.|Positive
I purchased this in July 2015.. Not satisfied for how much i paid!! you have to sit really close to feel it! I live in AZ and bought this for when i turn off my AC during peak hours to cool down. It's always set on high and does not cool down my bedroom. Also ice packs melt so fast u wait longer for them freezing it's really pointless.|Negative
The product works great here in Colorado, and cools the house down quickly!|Positive
In short: I bought this product twice and it was defective out of the box both times. I do not recommend this product. Quality control at Port-A-Cool is lacking. 1st time: Its +100F in the northern Nevada desert. I bought this cooler to keep me cool while I remodeled a room in my house. After unboxing and filling the cooler with water, I discovered that the fan louvers did not maintain their position. I would lift the louvers, only for them to immediately fall down and face the floor. Upon inspection it seemed that the louver locking mechanism was missing. Later (see 2nd time below) when I exchanged the unit, I discovered that the louver locking mechanism had been installed backwards from the factory. 2nd time: I exchanged the first cooler for the same model. Customer service at Home Depot was great. Took it home. Filled it with water (you think I would have learned to test it before filling it) and discovered that the fan switch was broken. It would not toggle to the low or high setting. Again, I had to drain the unit, pack it back up, and take it to the home depot. This is no small feat as the unit isn't light and is awkward to handle given its size. The defects on this model would have been easy to catch at the factory if port-a-cool had a simple quality control program to test the basic functionality of each unit. These simple defects do not inspire confidence in the long term quality of more costly parts like the fan motor and pump. I mean, if the manufacturer cannot get the simple things right, do you really expect long term reliability from this product? Do yourself a favor and stay away. PS: Its a shame as this product is made in the USA and I like to support USA jobs, but the quality is simply unacceptable.|Negative
Just what I needed!|Positive
Assembled and working as expected.|Positive
I currently have three of these in operation in my home for maintaining water level in large aquariums. One has been in operation over a year. Easy to adjust. Can't understand why the previous two reviewers had such problems. Perhaps they improved the quality of the valves...|Positive
We are very happy with the way it works! Great for working out on the garage in the summer in the Phoenix area!|Positive
Died after 7 weeks. Junk. Previous pump lasted 7 years.|Negative
Great water flow and tough construction, is working 24/7 and hasn’t missed a beat!|Positive
It's hard to move on carpet. Big and bulky. Loud but cooled the room OK.|Negative
I love this unit. Was just what I was looking for. Works very well for cooling one room at a time. Portable and holds 12.5 gallons of water. I roll it to whatever room I'm using and I'm not paying to cool the rooms I'm not using. Plus it is much more economical than regular air conditioner units of the same size and output. I like the swing button that makes the air flow sweep from side to side. The fan moves a tremendous amount of air for its size, even on low. I have had this unit for almost a month and an very pleased with it. The only thing I don't like is the lever on the right side of the output circle that directs the air flow up-down-or even. This lever is poorly designed and will not stay where you want it. Because of the high output of the fan, even on low, it will constantly direct the air flow upwards. I solved the problem by folding a small piece of paper and jamming it in there, making it stay where I put it. I prefer the air flow to come out straight, not upward or downward although this lever gives you those options. It is for this very reason that I knocked off a star on my rating the unit. I run it on low most of the time and it uses approximately a gallon an hour. It will use more water if you set it on medium or high setting. All and all, it is a great unit for the money spent and I would buy it again.|Positive
Best part of ordering is customer service at Air-n-Water. Either for ordering or service problems. Just plain great service.|Positive
We have had swamp coolers to cool our homes for the last 36 years and love them. It is an inexpensive way to cool the entire house. We have it mounted on the roof and vented into all rooms just like our central heat. It is so much cheaper than central air and allows us to use it without worry of a huge P.G.& E bill. We recommend these to everyone we know and would recommend to everyone we talk to. If you want an economical way to cool your entire house this is the way for you to do it.|Positive
This tower provides a good fan, however it did not cool as anticipated regardless of how much cold water we put into the reservoir.|Negative
"I am very impressed with this cooler. I know it's not an air conditioner so had limited expectations of its cooling ability, but it cools the air noticeable with the ice packs (it comes with two so you can alternate), and if it's not a hot day then the fan is very efficient with cooling the air when you just need a fan. The ""Swing"" setting dramatically increases the range of breeze, and when set on speed 3 (high) the fan is very effective. While using the cooling option with water & ice pack 2 is the highest setting for the fan. I have read that some people notice a lot of moisture from it, but I have not noticed much at all...there is no obvious mist that I could see. I think there's a separate humidifier setting which I haven't tried yet."|Positive
very happpy with it. but funny now is getti;ng cooler days. thanks.|Positive
This is not an air conditioner. This has been a great cooler, being able to add ice to the tray is very helpful. You can defiantly tell the difference when it has ice and when it doesn't.|Positive
Must state that there are two types of kits, round edge and square edge. The previous reviewer bought the square edge kit for a round edge cooler, then blames the square edge kit, and his creativity to make it fit. Hint,: buy the right kit, it is a lot easier to install.|Positive
The cooler was ready to use out of the box. We use it outside on the patio, it truly does keep the air 30 degrees cooler on a hot day, even when temps exceed 114, the patio was 85 degrees ( open patio no enclosure). One of the best purchases we made for summer enjoyment! Quality is excellent, the entire face of the unit allows air out, not just some small opening as most units have. Water hose ready, float and pump work excellent. We haven't used it above low setting yet ,people can feel the cool air 20 foot away from it. The oscillating feature is nice as well. Very happy with this purchase! We do have an open umbrella at the end of the patio to hold cool air at the sitting area, helps to retain the cool air in the space rather than just blowing past us!|Positive
This product does not blow much air and does not cool, PERIOD.|Negative
Be careful people. If you are looking to replace an existing evaporative cooler with one with a larger capacity, please be sure to look at the specifications and be sure it will fit. I bought this model cooler, paid for delivery and then found that an installation kit would be needed. Guess what folks. Home Depot couldn’t find a kit available. Anywhere!!! I looked online at Champion/Essick and couldn’t find a kit there either. My question is, what good is this cooler if you can’t make the necessary modifications for installation? Shopping at Home Depot may be a thing of the past for me. Not happy at all for the time as well as my money spent for nothing.|Negative
Well, with all the heat these last few weeks, it was tough to deal with. Had to get a smog for one of my customers and walked into his shop and he had a very large hessaire and boy what a difference. Found out that home depot carried a smaller version the 5300. Wow, what a difference. The 5300 covered about 1500 sf and it worked so well I bought a second on for my 3000 sf shop. Now it's no big deal to deal with 100 degree heat. Thanks Home Depot Highly recommend|Positive
I bought this evap cooler in spring 2017 to replace one I purchased in 2010. It worked very well on my back porch in Phoenix Arizona where we have high temperatures and low dew points. If you have high dew points where you live, an evap cooler may not work as well as you might expect. It's now May 2018 and I needed to service this unit. $650 is a lot of money, but the metal one I replace cost $400. The difference, and where I find the value in this one, is the hard water and scale build up. It didn't stick to or damage the composite material this unit is made from. The old one already had damage after it's first year. All the scale build up was easily washed out with a garden hose. The pump filter was easily disassembled and cleaned with some CLR. The pipe that dispenses water to the pads was also easily cleaned. Having maintained evap coolers in this climate for more than 30 years, I think the design of this unit justifies the price|Positive
There's no magic here. Making a room more humid does not really cool it down. I've tried multiple tactics to get this to work in a 200 sf room. The best results were when I had mainly ice in the water container, with 2 windows slightly open to create air flow. That resulted in about a 2 degree drop. It does feel cooler than a normal fan if you don't mind it blowing on you, so this may work for patios, etc., in that way. Otherwise, it's definitely not worth the money. I'll be returning it. I'd likely keep it if it was maybe a little more expensive than a standard fan.|Negative
The unit did not cool 200 sq ft. Just blew hot air even when it was filled with ice water. Do not waste your time and money.|Negative
We bought this product for our park model. But found that for a small living area it was far to loud .|Positive
Igood|Positive
Received on time and was very impressed. Definitely cools down our 1200 sq ft house. Definitely recommend.|Positive
I bought a New Air AF1000W evaporative air cooler for a family member who has advanced MS and is, thus, very heat sensitive and in danger of heat stroke in an unusually hot summer in our town. When the unit broke down, New Air staff were very helpful in arranging a quick replacement for the unit. My experience with New Air Staff was uniformly excellent- polite, concerned and efficient. Within one day of my call, a replacement unit was being shipped. Very impressive service!|Positive
We have hi humidity in Texas, works great in small area, with a window unit. Run the window unit ac for about 30 min (to lower humidity) and then turn the air cooler on. Cools great in a 10 x 20 metal building. It helps enough that I stay cool when its 100 F with only a small window unit.|Positive
This product more than met, it greatly exceeded my expectations. It included a new control panel for my unit that is friendlier to the desert conditions of Arizona. It works great and I highly recommend it to anyone that uses an evaporative cooler. I use mine exclusively and have no reason to turn on (my more expensive AC) at all. I have lived on the Arizona desert for 45 years and know how to save money to stay cool.|Positive
So far so good fit nicely over our unusually large central air unit. Has a nice opening in back to allow for pipes and electrical conduit. We got snow and rain so far it seems to be protecting unit well from elements|Positive
This does nothing to cool the air. All it is, is a fan. Tried everything horrible product.|Negative
These pads worked perfect!!!! But...enough of the aspen bark shavings escaped from the nylon mesh and plugged up the water pump!! I cleaned all the shavings out of the pump, and skimmed all the rest of the shavings out of the bottom of the cooler. Everything is 100%!!!!|Positive
Excellent Pump|Positive
Just remember this is not an A/C unit ! We have a 900 sq.ft casita and use this in the open plan main room, about 600 sq. ft. way more than this unit is rated for, but we only want to take the edge off these 90 and triple digit days. The desert cool of 65 is good in the morning until about 3:00 when we add ice to the units water to get it cold and turn it on. We run it until the room feels humid about 1.5 then run just the fan until it drys out again and run the unit again. It brings the 85 interior down to a reasonable 78 and life is good. We also run other fans to move the air around. By this time the sun is setting and the outdoors is cooling off so we open windows and bring in both the unit and outside to cool off for the evening. Great especially as we can't run an A/C out any of our windows and this is self-contained. Cheers.|Positive
Performs exactly as described. Clean design on the grille, like the slot to slide in the blank cover on winter. Construction could be a bit more solid, had to tweak one to get it to stay together. Definitely follow the instructions on the install!! It's tempting to just screw this to a joist, however that will interfere with normal operation.|Positive
Works great in AZ. Nice large water capacity. Store shipment worked great.|Positive
Put it in as a DIY, and while it requires a sturdy base, the cool air output was/is outstanding. Much more efficient that the traditional wet box; time will tell how the separate wet section holds up, but it just makes sense to have it all in plastic. Electrical hook up was a breeze.|Positive
Fits my evaporative cooler well. Sturdy canvas .|Positive
It cools well. The only downside is that you need to by a special hose attachment in order to not have to fill it manually (which is a pain, but great exercise if you enjoy that sort of thing in the heat)|Positive
So far, this has been an excellent cooler. It was pretty much ready to go right out of the box, I only had to install the caster wheels. U have used it while working in the garage, cooking on the patio, and in the house. It performs impressively.|Positive
Perfecto|Positive
Its been working all day ... every day ... for a week now ... no problems ...|Positive
As a single woman living alone I couldn't deal with having to climb up on the roof and switch over from heat to the whole house swamp cooler. It is a lot of work for a weak single lady so I looked for portable ac units. The AC units were very heavy nearly 100lbs of which I cannot lift by myself so I opted for a portable swamp cooler which were much lighter. I had to get help moving it from the store to my car because it was so bulky and I was worried it wouldn't fit in my car but luckily it did. When I got home I was able to unpack it myself and get it running. It cooled my bedroom just fine which was what I needed. I live in the Southwest and it dry heat. It is lightweight and it provides a nice cooling effect for the room, obviously not as cool as an ac unit but I can handle heat better than cold. It's great for nights when it gets to above 90 F. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it for single people who don't have a lot of upper body strength to move heavy stuff.|Positive
Overall a good product, cools in a small space. The only major problem is that the container that collects the water does not detach from the cooler for empting and cleaning, otherwise I would have given it an excellent rating. I have been using it about 3 weeks.|Positive
Learned our lesson last year, only covered Evap. Cooler with plastic for winter. Bought this cover, simple, easy install, great fit, and so far (installed 2 months) no problems. Has kept cold winter air out. Heavy canvas. Hoping we will see reduction in heating bills this winter.|Positive
It's wasn't as cold as I expect and filling up with water is a hassle.|Negative
I installed this in my rental property in Sacramento, CA. 912 sq ft bungalow. The tenant loves it. In mid-July when it is triple digits outside he said when he comes into his apartment it can be like an oven inside. He turn on the fan to blow all the out air our of his small house. He flips on the water pump for 5 minutes and then the fan. The place is cool in about 15-20 minutes. Uses very little energy to run and minimal maintenance. I became such a big fan I bought a second one of these for my mother in law in West Covina, CA. She lives in a 2,000 sq ft house. It blows out an amazing amount of air when you turn it on high. Just be sure and open a window on the other side of the house so the air has someplace to go. Read the instructions and follow them. I installed both myself with normal household tools. Get a helper because this item is heavy.|Positive
arrived damaged, tried to fix it ,after installation it's very noisy contacted the manufacturer, they don't have any out service ,they only recommended to return it to the shop I bought and order another one.|Negative
the first 1 we bought, got home and installed it and it had a bad circuit board. Called and took it back and Home depot had a new one loaded on a cart and ready for us. This one has been working fantastic!!|Positive
Too small.|Negative
I purchased the smaller unit last year and found it incapable of cooling the large outdoor area we have. This unit is great for our large area. We are finding some cooler evenings we have to turn the unit off as the temperature drops. We have the unit placed so we can turn it around and cool our outdoor deck and grilling area. Shipping to our home was $55 so we had it shipped to a local store. Pickup was very easy. This unit comes in a large box so make sure you have enough room to haul it. Extremely pleased with the quality and performance.|Positive
The 1000 CFM 3-Speed red evaporative cooler has been effective in helping to cool the living room. We live in northern CA, and the humidity here is low enough to make using an evaporative cooler a good option. We found that the unit is most effective when using chilled water and ice. Also, we experimented and found that it helped to angle the louvers up towards us as we sit in the living room. The cooler has been most effective for us in temperatures in the low 90's. However, it has not been quite as effective in higher temperatures. The area being cooled is approximately 400 square feet, so that may be a factor in it not providing more cooling. We thought about buying a bigger unit, but they were much bigger than this item.. This unit is not so large as to overwhelm the room. I bought the unit on sale and found it to be a good buy for us.|Positive
expensive|Positive
Bought this pump. Easy to install. Lasted one summer (2012) but now doesn't work. Hope it has more than a 30 day warranty.|Negative
Worked fine for my application which is a small water fountain. I picked this because of the brass body. It appears to be so much better than the plastic ones. Good value for the price.|Positive
Works fine.|Positive
This product provides the same cooling effects that a regular fan would. Nothing different. Too expensive!!|Negative
There are some sharp edges from the casting.|Positive
Pump replacement was straightforward and worked perfectly.|Positive
Good cover for the price. Easy to fit and easy to secure.|Positive
Fit as it should. Currently 5 star, will see how it is at the end of the season.|Positive
This product was as it was advertised.|Positive
I had used this product for 9 summers. It cooled well. But, it is a bad idea to take a simple tried and true swamp cooler and add a circuit board control with a remote. Mind went out twice, and I had to order the $50 circuit board and install it. Also don't get confused about the window dimensions. The width and height are reversed in there specs. Although the cooler worked well for nine seasons before the squirrel cage baring stated going out, I will try to find one without the remote. Come on people. Is ok to have to get out of your chair to turn the cooler on and off lol.|Negative
i received the item 4/21/15 now 4/23/15 the remote is not working i don't know whats next , NEXT IT IS BROKEN 1/1/16 LESS THAN A YEAR NOT WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE ITS BETTER TO BUY AN AIR CONDITIONER.|Negative
Best not to use the washers so that the wheels change of orientation when moving unit around do not bind. I removed them from the wheel install and it works much better--rolls and turns direction freely. I keep a hose attached to it with a shut off valve on it for easy removal of hose for temporarily positioning unit where the hose would not reach. I like the roving fins to direct the air all around the area. If working in a set spot I do turn the swing feature off. I installed a Heavy Duty door handle on the left metal plate underneath with pop rivets, and ran a lock cable thru it to a chair and desk to discourage theft. Notice the cable & lock in the picture.|Positive
worked just like it should. no problem . .........|Positive
I got the cooler in a short amount of time, started it up and noticed the water pump was pumping the water up but the water wasn't distributing the water over the cooling frame. I called the manufacturer and talked to customer service, they said that the holes might be stopped up. I took the thing apart no holes stopped up put it back together still no improvement. I guess I payed $285.00 for a fan.|Negative
Yes I love it. It works really great okay I'll recommend this product|Positive
Fits my unit well. Not a big fan of how it secures to the unit, and are pretty sure it will blow off with a good gust of wind. I would suggest using Velcro to secure it better.|Positive
I'm using the cooler in my corrugated 784 sq ft aircraft hangar. The temps outside have been in the high 90's to low 100's and the temps inside stay at a comfortable & consistent 80-85 degree level.|Positive
I have lived with swamp coolers for years so I know how they function. We are in AZ so it’s super dry, perfect for a swamp box. First off, the media is TINY maybe 8”x 10” so there’s not much surface area to do much of anything. Then they place a 12” fan over it and there is a 2” gap between the shroud and media leaving the fan to pull from the path of least resistance, which isn’t through the media. The fan blows 90% of the air at the very top and very bottom of the output, if you place your hand directly in front of it there is a massive dead zone with very little airflow. The front vents are manually adjusted up and down but don’t really do anything because most of the air is coming from above and below them. This design allows for too much airflow around a too small of media which makes for a poor performing cooler. Go look at the more expensive portable coolers and you will notice the units are better sealed so the airflow goes where it’s needed, through the media.|Negative
We love the cooler. We do not use the water cooler part, just the fan but it does a very good job of cooling an area of 325 Sq. ft. No parts to install,just plug it in. It is on rollers so it is easy to move. We live in central Florida so we have high heat and humidity all summer.|Positive
Overall nice unit.float in the wrong place|Positive
Excellent product at a fare price.|Positive
Was very happy when item arrived on time. Was well packaged and easy to set up. Very easy to get started. Has a great sleek design, love that it is on wheels to move where it is needed. Works just as described. Really brought the temps down in the room when running. The cooling and humidifying affect is great and gets started quickly. you can run it as just a fan, or when needed run the cooling function and it really does the job.. Is helping to keep our air off on the days where it is starting to get too warm. I would say it is totally worth the investment. Very happy with product and would recommend and even nice enough to give as a gift. Very happy... thank you|Positive
Only cools up to 800 sq'. Just average rating.|Negative
Yes i’m Enjoying it, it doesn’t want to get very cool when the humidity is high, but the fan on it is awesome. I never got any paperwork on the warranty I bought. Thanks|Positive
I live north tx humidity 50~ 60% we live in a 600 so ft home. For our area 800 sq ft is Max for this unit. happy to say it keeps the house in the low 80s when outside is over a 100|Positive
After a week or so of heavy use the fan on mine died. I'll try one more time.|Negative
I purchased the cooler on 6/14/2017 and the Home Depot salesman filled out the online request for a contractor to install the cooler. The Home Depot contractor has never called me. The cooler sits in my garage waiting to be installed.|Negative
This was missing a motor mount and a pulley retaining screw, which caused loud clicking noises. It took me 3 hours to diagnose and fix two manufacturing defects - I'm in the slow class, to be sure;-) Mfgr offered to pay for the parts! Not a satisfactory experience.|Negative
"A good, dry climate, Evaporative Cooler. If you live in humid area this will NOT work for you. We have had other similar coolers but this one is definitely an improvement. It's quiet at low speed but pretty noisy when you turn it on high speed. There is a one to two week break in period for the water pad to soften up and work more efficiently. The one downside is it is hard to see the water level in the clear window, a little wiggle of the unit cases the water to move then you can see the level easier. It has a water filler on the side which is easy to access and you don't have to turn the unit off to refill. It also has an ""oscillating"" feature. When it is on the directional blades move back and forth to spread the cool air around better. Be sure to allow room behind the unit for the incoming air. If it get too close to a table cloth or drapes it will such them up against the back of the unit and stop the air flow. You also need to vacuum the filter on the back outside of the unit every few weeks. It moves a lot of air and the dust builds up surprising fast as it sucks it out of the air in the room. One weird thing is when you first turn it on, it starts on speed 2 then switches to speed 1. I assume it uses the higher speed to send more power to the fan motor to get it started."|Positive
This is the best cooler we have ever owned. Works great.|Positive
Easy to install and works as it should|Positive
The unit does a good job of blowing air and if the humidity is not too high, it also does a good job of cooling the air. My complaint is that the unit is made of thin plastic and I am very concerned about how well it will hold up. The hinges on the top lid seem especially weak. The other area of weakness is the plastic spout where the water hose connects. It is all plastic and looks like it would be very easy to break off if you have a hose connected and then try to move the unit. All-in-all, looks good, works fair, built cheap is my impression.|Negative
We kept putting ice and the air was just a tad cooler than a fan, it didn't make much of a diference.|Negative
Looked on numerous sites after measuring my vent. Ordered this cover hoping for the best.....well, it's a perfect fit. Thanks|Positive
Received the cover in early October, but the weather has been too nice to shut down the cooler. Heavy duty canvas won't fall apart for at least 6 years! I was surprised by the fact that it had a Velcro zipper to go around the electrical connection at one of the four sides (very convenient). Get yourself a extra tie cord (12') to wrap the cover. 1st week in November and it's getting colder and our cooler is now secured for the worst of winter!|Positive
This is a great cover and I would recommend it for weatherization of your cooler and to help keep your heating bill down. My only complaint is the first cover I bought only lasted 3 seasons but then I live in the high desert where weather conditions are extreme and it is difficult to find anything that will last the seasons here.|Positive
This product stopped oscillating two weeks after we received it and we had already thrown away the box it came with so the girl on the phone told us it could not be returned with out that. Don't waste your money!!!|Negative
the air coming out was not cold even with ice.|Negative
Very well made with extra length (just in case).|Positive
Very happy with the cooler. It works well in my large upstairs studio by sliding screen door. Many compliments.|Positive
The plastic door that opens up the cavity in which you put the water is very flimsy. It is hard to open and I really doubt it will last the life of the machine. You have to pull hard on a corner in order to open the door; then bang on it in order to get it to close. Otherwise, the machine seems to do what it was made for--cooling off a room.|Negative
It took the water to a new level.|Positive
exactly the size expected. Fit my Mastercooler swamp cooler like a glove.|Positive
"This motor works just fine. I've read other reviews talking about some kind of ""noise"" it makes. I didn't have that issue at all. Make sure you use the correct size of pulley AND that the new pulley is adjusted properly to accommodate the belt. A larger motor requires a different sized pulley. I've never had to replace a motor before but viewed plenty of videos on youtube to learn what I was in for. It was super easy! One thing I came across was the that the old brackets that hold the motor were badly rusted and a little hard to remove. After I replaced them, I lightly sprayed with oil to protect them. I went with the same size motor that was came with it 6yrs ago since I run the cooler on ""Low"" speed anyway. Evap's are more efficient at this speed so no need for a more powerful motor. The motor has absolutely no noises of any kind!"|Positive
This is junk. Installed it, adjusted it, over flowed. The valve will not shut off the water flow no mater how much bend you put in the brass rod.|Negative
I like the cooler and the excellent job it does in cooling our whole house. Home Deopt was very efficient in taking my order and getting it shipped to my home very quickly.|Positive
Durable and ease to install|Positive
Does a great job in a small guest bedroomVery attractive and functional. So far no problems|Positive
I purchased this Portable Humidifier so I can stay cool during the summer months on my patio. It has a really good blower fan on it to push the cool moist air around. I like the auto refill Hookup with a garden hose so you don't have to manually add water. I mostly used on the high setting for outdoor use. It is light in weight and is easily moved around on caster wheels that have a lock on two. I installed an RV water filter inline to help catch sediment from the hard water we have here in N.M.|Positive
This is the second one of these coolers that I have bought. The first is five years old and still working very well, better than any other cooler I've seen. With two, we can cool our whole house (about 1800 sq. ft) on the hottest, muggiest days around here (Tucson). My son has one too and cools his house with it in Washington State (east side). Seems very well built and reliable. No worries about it rusting out, and not having to change pads every year is a great plus. I do find that fitting the cover back on is a little tricky--it is important to push on the top edge of the cover to slip a lip into place on the back side of the cover.|Positive
Disappointed in this product. Just blows humidity into area, little cooling. I have used an evaporative cooler on my home for 20 years which successfully brings the temperature down 20 degrees in our dry climate. Not sure if the problem is the motor power or style of pads.|Positive
The cooler works well. I am very happy with cooler.|Positive
installing was easy and only took approx. 20 minutes it was up and running.|Positive
Having had another brand portable cooler I like this model/brand the best. It is easy to set up and very light to move w/ casters. 2 sources for water and the capacity make it great. It put's out a lot of cool air and the oscillation feature is perfect. 1600cfm and it feels like it in my 920 sq, ft. shop. Oh, not being made of metal offers me a long time of use. I like that and if you are considering this, do it. Negative...still looking for a source for replacement parts, just in case. Nothing in the manual.|Positive
Works good, not so loud, perfect for my husband's little man cave. The size is just perfect. Love that it can plug into a hose. Temperature drops from 110 to 94|Positive
We had purchased two portable evaporative coolers in the past few years, and both did an adequate job, but were hard to maintain, and were not at all attractive to look at. This Honeywell evaporative cooler is not only nice to look at, but is very easy to keep clean. The controls are easy to use, it's easy to fill with water, and the overnight setting is a plus.|Positive
Very easy to set up. Install the wheels, fill with water and your ready to go. Cooler works good and keeps me cool in my garage as long as the cooler is pointing directly at me. The only problem I had with this cooler is the oscillation feature did not work right out of the box. I have not troubleshot to see why this feature does not work and I didn't want to return it and wait for another one to be delivered to my house. So I will either figure out why the oscillation does not work or I'll just live with it as is. If you can get this cooler on sale I would recommend buying it.|Positive
So far the Honeywell portable Evaporative Cooler is working. Not sure how it will work when we have 100 degrees if it will cool the living room. At this point I'm satisfied withnit.|Positive
well the thing works, but you need to ask me about stars in about 3 years!|Negative
It blew out air but it never really got cold. The water tank had to be filled twice a day and we used distilled water at $1.49 a gallon. I am not sure if it was not working properly or if this is how it works. I am going to return for a window air conditioner.|Negative
I love our master craft cooler. Keeps us cool even when its 108 degrees.|Positive
I'm sure it's a great pump, but doesn't match on the fittings. I guess you don't sell the fitti gs to match it.|Negative
I have had the same cooler for twenty years. and my wife would still get sick in the summer because of the heat. now that we have this new cooler. she doesnt get sick anymore. if they would have had this cooler along time ago. would have saved her alot of headaches|Positive
This is by far the best portable air conditioner I've ever bought it moves a lot of air, that is very cool. I plan on buying another one, and recommend it to anybody looking for a good efficient cooler.|Positive
When I purchased this item it worked great for a week but now it never cools. I'm seriously thinking about returning it.|Negative
Great value for the money. Easy to install. Low exterior profile. Small but powerful. Cools very well, but it's a bit noisy to have in a bedroom.|Positive
Doesn't cool at all. Nothing more than an expensive fan.|Negative
Item arrived and ONLY worked on the low setting. A piece of junk- save your money.|Negative
It works great! keeps area cooled and works as if I had an air conditioner.|Positive
first let me say the customer service was good with quick replies however the calling times were not so great, as we bought this unit later in the day to find out that they only have a few hours a day you can call for assistance. the unit itself was not so great as we followed the instructions to extend the fan and to screw the screws in did not connect that easy as we found out later. the float valve assembly would not let water in as the float was extended to far and caught against the frame. with help from customer service we fixed the problem by screwing the float further onto the stem. while we had the cover off fixing the float i noticed the screws to the extension were not connected we the had to remove the unit from the window and force the extension to line up to get the screws fully attached. these units are made of plastic and the hotter it is outside the more difficulty it is to align things. for what we paid for the unit and what we had to do the unit price should be lowered or a refund for time spent as they have not repair persons contracted for these units its either you fix it or return it and since its 50 miles one way we had to do it our self as they offer no compensation. i would not recommend to people with disabilities or anyone who does not have knowledge of repair.|Negative
Fits a little loose. Could be a little smaller for my turbines.|Positive
Mineral build up on the pad has to be cleaned often.|Positive
The cover fits perfectly and I can tell it's making a difference when I stand under a vent.|Positive
I had to reorder the product three times. Every time I went to pick it up it was damaged.|Negative
Excellent design, simple to disassemble and change to side or down draft. I added a additional pump for draining and cleaning which works great, dirty water out and fresh water in takes about 5 minutes. Noise level for this unit is average I my opinion. Purchase to cool garage.|Positive
I guess I didn’t know what to expect but I did expect an Evaporative Cooler to be better at cooling a room than a plain fan. The guests in my upstairs bedroom gave the cooler just an average grade. I did expect a bit more given the $166 price tag.|Negative
Great pump, has a constant water flow. Low noise. Easy to install.|Positive
The cooler runs a very long time on a fully filled water tank, at the maximum water flow setting on low. It does a good job of cooling the room we bought it for. It is noisy, but I am hopeful to see lower electric bills this summer. We did buy three total, and one of them did not cool as efficiently, due to the water flow mechanism not changing from minimum to maximum, and the tank level indicator jumped up and down and made even more noise than the blower. Because we had two others that were working well, it was easy to figure out the problem with the third. We will return, and have already ordered a replacement. So, obviously I would buy it again. For the money, it is a good unit.|Positive
Just what we needed easy to operated and delivers the humidity|Positive
I'm looking forward to many years use of this cover. The construction and material quality leads me to believe that I won't be disappointed.|Positive
I recomothis because it’s needed. Don’t know why it has two shorter legs. They just barely attached to side of air conditioner. My cooler is on the ground, so flat surface. May work great on pithed roof. But flat roof or on the ground, not so much.|Negative
Good price|Positive
Just what I needed to fix my swamp coolers water drop tube. Wow, it does bend around the 90 degree tube turn with ease. It is now unblocked again and the water flows like new.|Positive
The store did not have this cooler so I went on The Home Depot online, found, and purchased it. It came fast and easy to operate.|Positive
Said it had a 20 foot cord only 10|Positive
Easy to install, GUI is straightforward and easy to use, though the users instructions could have had more detail. Got used to it in a couple of days, and love it.|Positive
I was very satisfied with the purchase of my Down-Draft Evaporative Cooler.|Positive
Cooler works just as it should. It has two speeds each for fan with water and without. Plenty of cooling for the area in front of fan. Adds lots of humidity and cooling for a 200 sq ft room. Easy to add water.|Positive
Pump failed after three weeks. Considering other positive reviews, decided to return under Home Depot’s 30 days warranty to replace, hoping it was a lemon. Review of New Air Customer Service: quite poor; reps lacked knowledge; online manual lacked necessary detail; reg site malfunctions.|Negative
Needed to find swamp cooler replacement pads for a standard nearly-square large evaporative cooler. They fit perfectly. Four pads came in the set. Great value.|Positive
"The airflow was the most disappointing on the unit. You have to be standing direclty in front of the coolers to feel anything. The air pattern is so narrow if it hits you on the chest, you won't feel any air on your legs. It's also very loud. It seems that ""Assembled in USA with imported parts"" is the reason for the high price. But I think that many of the import coolers does a better job. Should have trusted the reviews on competitor products."|Negative
Looks Nice in the room. Cooler than the average fan. I only wish the fan can point up and down, but not many tower fans have that ability.|Positive
It worked.|Positive
The cooler worked great for 4 days and then the fan stopped on the low setting only. Otherwise, the other speeds worked fine and the room stayed cool in 98 degree weather. Honeywell quickly replaced the unit at no charge.|Positive
Fits like a glove!|Positive
inadequate fan, cooling is minimal at best even with ice. terrible product for the money for the heat of AZ. Doesn't even cool a small bathroom.|Negative
Easy to assemble and the product there in a timely manner|Positive
Product is perfect for protecting AC condenser. Love the free shipping from Home Depot|Positive
perfect fit, easy install, no missing parts.|Positive
We were very happy that Home Depot was able to get the cover that fits our roof-top swamp cooler perfectly. Thank you!|Positive
I bought this portable AC unit for my elderly aunt who lives in El Paso, a dry climate, because it works great. I would not recommend for a moist environment. In El Paso, my aunt has a swamp cooler and they tend stop cooling when it gets too hot. This portable AC unit works great not only for those days but every day. It cools the room she's in extremely well. You put in the required amount of water in the reservoir and turn it on. Once the water has evaporated, the AC keeps blowing air like a fan. It has made her very happy. TIP: the legs are inside the unit, not in the box.|Positive
It works great!|Positive
This evap cooler is everything it is hyped up to be. It cools the entire house (about 1800 s.f..), is low noise and takes up a lot less room than the old cooler. It was very easy to install but it would have been great to have the hose kit needed for the water included rather than have to go back to store to purchase. The information indicates it will drain off up to 3 gallons of water but I have found it only drains off about 1 cup a day. This may be due to it being in a shady location and/or the temp hasn't hit over 100 yet. I would and have recommended this product to others!|Positive
Unit used in approx. 600 sg ft portion of the house and has kept that portion of the house around 80 degrees when out side temp is 100 degrees. This is obtained with unit most of the time on the low setting. Only problem I had was the base pan had an area that wasn't sealed so I had to seal it with silicone prior to using. A little more quality control would be nice. Had unit only 2 weeks so will review again in 3 months if any problems come up.|Positive
I painted and smoothed the wheels to make a rustic cart coffee table.|Positive
Great value! Found this cooler after I went to return similar one I found at the same price but a third of the CFMs! Really easy to use out of the box. Was cooling my patio in less than 5-10 minutes. Rear evaporative surface area totally saturated in minutes. Only drawback is that it doesn't have an oscillating feature. Was worth the $179 I paid for it to cool off guests in 107 degree heat at my daughter's b-day party!|Positive
Float was weak, had to replace with a stronger one. Otherwise ok.|Positive
We have it in the garage for watching football games with friends and neighbors. Does a great job in cooling the temps down.|Positive
the sill cock leaks and I could not get it to stop. do not buy this product|Negative
Worth the money. Quality..... I get about three seasons out of these floats. Cheaper ones will go out after a few months on occasion. Its a crap shoot. Ive tried em all.|Positive
Perfect fit easy to install fast shipment|Positive
Great fit it was just too bad they didn't carry it in the store.|Positive
This is a great unit for a small space up to 300 square feet in an apt located in a dry climate. Yes it does cool effectively and quietly. It is also easy to maintain and clean as well. I do appreciate the excellent customer service I received via email from Ivette, an Air and Water Sales and Product Support specialist to professionally resolve an issue to a positive result.|Positive
Had to give an average rating, since I have not yet installed the cover on my cooler and will not do so until this fall. Sorry.|Negative
Great price easy to install. A big thanks Home Depot when it was hot your customer Service was great. They made sure I got the last pump on the self. ;)|Positive
It’s 100 degrees out and I’m freezing my butt off! This was a replacement for a underpowered unit and is literally night and day difference. This thing kicks! I use it in my outside shop which is <400 sq.ft & partially insulated. I can’t believe I tolerated the heat this long! Highly recommended!|Positive
Good product, easy to assemble goes through water like crazy. I use it to save on energy cost from refrigerated air and so far seems to be working. It is a loud unit of running on high but overall a good product. My level gave out after the second tank full but not a big issue since I can still see|Positive
Easy to assemble, little more noisy but cools good.|Positive
We purchased two to cover 1000 sq ft of our 1862 sq ft, so we have a choice of using one or two depending They have done a good job thus far in the dry air of New Mexico. We have not experienced 95+ temps yet but at 90F they did well. On High can be quite noisy, but we have only used Low and that has been adequate. The best price on the market as far as I can tell. I bought it from Home Depot about a month ago vs the manufacturer because if I had to return it I would have had to pay shipping back to manufacturer. I did buy the 2 year extra warranty because I like Home Depot's warranty terms. We use a watering bucket, 2 gallon, to fill it with water; it takes 2 1/2 of them. It seems to last for about 4 hours which is about all we need them for since we live in the mountains and the cool air of evening comes quickly. I don't like the rectangular fill hole; seems to me they could have easily designed a larger one. I seem to spill some water every time. We use a rug with rubber backing, larger than the unit itself in case of spilled water.|Positive
Doing what we needed them to do! Nice and sturdy; hoping to get many Tx seasons out of them. I read other reviews and added a bungee cord around the middle to reinforce the skimpy tie rope. Held well in last storm!|Positive
Probably one of the best units available. Looks good, not heavy, but definitely not for 1 bedroom. Low speed is higher than high speed on a stand up fan so if you have it in a bedroom on low it's like a hurricane in there. You definitely need the windows open even if it's hot outside. Needs massive ventilation or small space will get humid quick. Awesome for large areas or outdoors.|Positive
Does not keep space cool for more than an hour. I've even added regular ice to water. The freeze packs dont work at all.Purchase a different type cooler from another company.|Negative
It is never disclosed ANYWHERE that in order for this product to be installed, you also need to purchase a very specific pulley. A rather large oversight which was extremely frustrating.|Negative
Unit was not moving any water over fins when I turned on. Luckily I am handy and after opening up the unit found that the hose was very thin and being crimped from the way it was routed. I rerouted and reinforced the hose and now it works great.|Positive
I had to replace the pump in my cooler. I figured that I might as well replace the float, The old float was a toilet float that was adapted to work. The new one installed in less than ten minutes and worked great.|Positive
This cooler can freeze you out if your air is dry enough. Building a tiny home out of a semi trailer and it has lots of doors so I get a lot of fresh dry desert air inside. This things cooling capacity is amazing, it uses the same type of cellulose pads that the big master cool units use. Just remember with indoor portable swamp coolers, it can get humid and muggy and become unable to cool if there is not enough fresh dry air getting to it so make sure you have a window or door open.|Positive
"I didn't purchase the model shown but another model ""AF-350"" back in 2008 and it worked great when it worked, then after only a few hours of operation on the day I purchased it, it broke down. The fan motor was stuck, wouldn't spin, then a humming sound with a puff of smoke, and that was the end of it. It was broken! I returned it to the company I bought it from for a compete refund. I have read another review on a similar model from NewAir and there's broke on the same day. Another person review here shows that there's broke down too."|Negative
Had the AF=310 model one week, its to loud for my small home office. Tried to contact company on land line, no reply. In temperatures near 100, it did very little to lower the temp, even when I used lots of ice ad small amount of water.|Negative
I bought this cooler to replace an older and less efficient one. It was not hard to install and cools the house down quickly, which is surprising for it's small size.|Positive
This interior cover fits great and does what its made to do. NOW, the exterior cover is another story. I am very satisfied with my purchase of the interior cover and I would recommend it to others.|Positive
Fit like OEM and fast delivery.|Positive
Went out within a month|Negative
I have owned this unit about a month now, and I have to say that I love it! I don't have central AC just a window unit in the main living area. I like the fact that there on small casters to make it easier for me to move from my home office during my workday, to my bedroom in the evening and overnight. It does keep both rooms much more cooler than going without.|Positive
Belt was exactly what I needed to serviced my evap cooler.|Positive
I bought this unit for my chicken coop here in AZ... Keeps the coop nice and cool, like all the different settings...Awesome lil swamp cooler!!!|Positive
"On warm days, it cooled, ""okay"", but on hot days, it made the room muggy and even hotter. I ended up having to return it and ended up purchasing a portable air conditioner."|Negative
Works great and better than expected as long as the due point is low enough. Not as noisy as I thought based on other reviews. I only has this a few months and hoping this unit will continue to perform. I am using this unit in my three car garage here in the Phoenix area. I would buy this again.|Positive
I would have checked excellent, however, the kit only included 4 screws per vent (I purchsed 2 vents). I felt this wasn't sufficient for holding in place. I ended up using the old screws that came with the set we bought about 30 years ago. Everything went into place & they are beautiful!|Positive
Unit is fully enclosed. No space big enough to put block ice to keep water cold !!|Positive
The order arrived 3 days earlier. The DDECC fits exactly on my cooler as it describes on the manual. So far it works fine and great protection from the heat wave 102F for 4 consecutive days.|Positive
This evaporated cooler workers great!!!!!!|Positive
Ordered two of these turbine covers. When the order arrived and I got home to install them, one cover was excessively caked with chunks of dye all over it! It was completely useless and I needed to return it and re-order. Covers are OK but quality-control was poor. A wasted trip back to Home Depot|Negative
For a item thats made to cool a space it does not do the job....a do not buy grom me|Negative
The only issue was trying to find an electrical cord for the motor. Motor works great and universal. Comes with only motor in box with no other parts. Spade connections make for simple wire hook up.|Positive
The Cooler was easy to set up and start. The air was cooled about 20% better, especially, increasing the humidity in a 90+ degree dry heat room. The cooler is tolerably loud in the low setting so you have to turn up the television or leave the room to talk on the phone. At its medium and high settings it is louder; however, it does a good job of cooling the room fast and satisfactorily. Visit a Home Depot that might have one on display to experience it in person before purchasing it. I didn't do that because I was desperate to have it ready to use as soon as it was delivered. I expected it to be loud but the cool air outweighs the noise that is tolerable until the room is cooled then turn it off for awhile. I left it on a few hours while I did some errands and was pleasantly surprised the whole house was cooler and humidified. You have to set it in front of an open window or door and have another window or door open to vent the circulating air, otherwise, it will not work properly. It holds over 9 gallons of water so refilling it depends on how long it is used and the cooler alerts you when it is nearly empty to refill it ASAP to avoid damaging the water pump.|Positive
This thing doesn't work, at all. It blew room temperature air like a weaker fan, and sometimes the turbine would just slosh water out. I'm not sure if it just came broken or what, but this thing is trash.|Negative
Good quality and does the job it was designed to do.|Positive
It isn’t very cool. You need to sit inches away from the vent to get any relief from the heat. Very disappointed over all|Negative
Have been using about a week to cool HVAC unit that is unable to handle the extreme heat in west Texas (110 plus) and avoid having to spray with water sprinkler. Has been effective. Only issue is the switch for fan speed/water on-off. No words, just symbols and these are not clear as to which is high fan-low fan and fan with water. Once this was clear, no issues. Recommend following instructions regarding shutting pump off and allowing fan to blow for 30 minutes to avoid hard water residue from building up. Based on my limited experience, this might work well for small porch, patio, garage or workshop in low humidity areas; probably not effective for areas over 300 square feet.|Positive
I am seriously in love with this fan. I have been so pleasantly surprised at how functional and easy to use it is - it came fully assembled and my entire family has love it. I like that it can be used both as a fan and as a cooler. In the desert where I live, the cooler is amazing, but not always needed. Versatile and effective - love it!|Positive
I have had this motor for a week now it is very noisy on low buzz (hum) don't hear it so much on high other than that works well. It is very easy to put in you don't have to do any modifying on the motor to make it fit|Negative
The roof turbines do a great job of cooling my attic during the hot summers, but they do the same thing in cold winter months. These turbine covers make 2-3 degrees difference in temperature for the inside of my home. With them covered, the sun warms up my attic and the heater runs a lot less.|Positive
Matched original equipment perfectly., and ordering through HD was a breeze.|Positive
I'm not impressed with this at all. It barely blows out any air. And when it says cooling off for 250 sq ft that is not true. Please do not purchase this!|Negative
It's what was needed. Quick delivery and packaged well. I'll buy more.|Positive
"First, you have to understand what this is for: it's a ""spot cooler"" not a room or house unit. You aim it at your work station and it blows air at you that's about 15 degrees cooler than ambient temperature. Don't pay attention to the square foot rating. It's based on a metric that applies only to much larger units, and even then no one really likes that condition anyway. Evap coolers work on direct impingement of the air on the occupant. It has wheels: use them to point it at your workstation. Use in a space that's open to the outside (because the moisture is going to build up in an enclosed space). Forget the ice: silly; colder water doesn't really produce much colder air (you have to use a buncha psychrometrics to understand that), and the ice melts in just a few minutes anyway. Once you unnerstan how it works, it is an excellent tool for the job: keeping me cool(er)."|Positive
Yep. Worked as expected. Had it installed most of the summer.|Positive
Not quite, but it is just adequate.|Negative
wasn't sure what to expect after reading some of the negative reviews. product was as described and works as i hoped|Positive
I bough this unit thinking it would be better than the old squirrel cage cooler. I WAS VERY WRONG! 1- the instructions are horrible! 2- the unit is NOT EASY TO INSTALL - OR GET INTO THE BACK OF ONCE THE COVER IS ON. 3- the unit IS VERY NOISY EVEN ON LOW 4-YOU CAN NOT ADJUST THE DIRECTION OF THE AIR FLOW 5- WASTE WATER ! we adjusted the float several times (struggling to get the back off !) had to empty a bucket several times a day-last straw was when I didn't get to the bucket in time and water was everywhere on my balcony. 6-ONCE INSTALLED I TRIED IT FOR A FEW DAYS, UNINSTALLED IT AND RETURNED IT.|Negative
Works great cools how I need not. Pump does not burn out when runs dry. Great unit.|Positive
Good quality. Fits perfectly. Heavy duty. Easy to use.|Positive
Just didn’t like it. Loud you have to fill the water all the time (3-4 times in 8-10hrs) and the door to put the water in isn’t very big so it’s hard to fill with a pitcher. ☹️|Negative
The unit was fairly easy to install. The hardest part was getting water to it and filling in the window opening. We put in our upstairs master bedroom and it cools the whole floor. Even the downstairs I we open and shut the right windows. Love it.|Positive
It made the room hot and humid. It did not cool the room at all.|Negative
Love it, thank you,|Positive
I was initially skeptical about ordering this for my den as I didn't want something bulking like the other fans and home air purifiers that are on the market. This tower unit is sleek with amazing features and almost looks like a sound speaker for my TV! You won't go wrong with this and the price is AWESOME! So good that I have ordered an additional one for my son's apartment!|Positive
Bought this to take the place of the old one, the vent door were falling off. The new one was smaller than the old one it fit, but had to drill new hole for screws, think it will not last, plastic does not seem durable, will buy the metal next time.|Negative
I purchased this cooler almost 3 years ago and have had great cooling with it. I have replaced the pump twice, but that is to be expected. Every once in a while the fan / motor will rattle. The pad cover is a bit difficult to remove and re-install|Positive
Exactly as advertised and of quality. The included instructions were basic and very adequate. At this price I should likely keep a spare.|Positive
Fit well, seems well constructed. Would buy again. Should last a long time.|Positive
It has to be directly on you to fill it and I get tired of filling the pan.|Positive
Pump only lasted 2 months and needed to be replaced|Negative
This is a perfect fit on my screened in porch. Blows well and is quiet. Looks good too. Shipper called me and set up a convenient time for me and delivered it at that time. I couldn't ask for better way to shop for an evaporative cooler. I'm considering another for my shop.|Positive
"I wanted an evap. cooler for my garage that I can install through the wall. The product description stated that the grill was ""convertible"" for easy installation in casement windows and ""between wall studs"". NOT! I found out after I got it home and unpacked it that the grill is not convertible. I can NOT be installed between wall studs. I even took the entire thing apart to see if I could turn the grill/output 90 degrees to make it fit in between the studs, and you can't. While I had it apart I looked at it a little closer and I was not impressed with any part of it. The aspen pads were only 1/2 the density you would need to get any real cooling--you could see gaps through the pads where hot air would pass through. When the unit was assembled in the factory they messed it up and had to redrill holes to get things to line up. You would never know this unless you took it apart like I did. Finally, I plugged it in to assess the air output and the fan assembly was out of whack. One of the two rotating fans was bent and it wobbled. This would eventually lead to squeaking bearings and motor failure. I didn't like the ""direct drive"" design of the motor for that reason. It is easy to replace a regular motor/belt drive system but it looks like the direct drive motor would require the fan assemblies to be replaced too, at extra cost to be sure. Overall, not worth the $339 price so I returned it. The model that DOES have a convertible air discharge is $450 so I purchased a Bonaire Durango instead for just $30 more. That has a very slim plastic case that will look better and fit better for my needs. I was willing to overlook the general ugliness of the Champion for the cost savings, but I couldn't overlook the poor quality. The pad material on the Bonaire is much better than the cheap aspen pads on the Champion too. Overall, the Bonaire Durango looks like it will be worth the extra $130."|Negative
Doesn't always shut the water off.|Negative
Fast delivery, as expected. Easy to install and working great.|Positive
Unit works well.|Positive
My husband, and our 21 year old son, use the cooler every evening, as well as, every weekend working in the garage. They love it! All of their friends that come over want to know where we got it. How much was it? Do you like it? Hand's down the best gift.|Positive
This was the only 3/8 float valve HD stocked to use on a water fountain. Definitely have to regulate the amount of water flow as full city line pressure blew the end cap off. Was not crimped very well. Have had these in the past hold up under full city line pressure.|Negative
The quality seems good, it went on the cooler reasonably easily.|Positive
The real test is how many seasons it will last. Runs good new, haha.|Positive
I agree with other reviewers that the smell was plastic-y & unpleasant at first. It works itself out eventually, so don't let it be a sticking point about buying this product. Also, the hatch where the water supply goes is a bit difficult to open. Be sure to follow the directions about airflow, as it is very important that the cooler have plenty of fresh air to push, or it WILL just make the room hotter. I live in Sparks, NV, so the temperature gets extreme in the summer. On 100 degree days, even with the cooler on its highest speed setting, it's still a bit warm. However, this goes a long way to making the room more bearable.|Positive
Works great and very portable.|Positive
Wish it come with a motor. Hope it lasts as long as the old one did|Positive
Yes! The pump held up thru sand storms ,rain and lightning. Feel it will hold up thru anything....good product.|Positive
Installed this model and even the professional repairmen I called out to tweak the swamp cooler were unable to get the flow right. Am going to try bending the rod this morning, but based on other reviews, that won't work. A buyer shouldn't have to go through such machinations for what was advertised as a higher quality float.|Negative
I use my item to keep my bedroom very cool & one unit has replaced approximately four of my other fans. I have older winter type dogs that need cooling off & they just love this fan. They sleep in my room with the fan all the time & sleep very sound. I became ill & my medication has made me extremely hot & I could not believe what a difference this fan has made. I am so comfortable with the cool air that I sleep so sound & finally after many many years, started even dreaming. I highly recommend this product. And as any product you buy it should be maintained & kept clean. My mother liked it so much that she purchased one for another part of the house. She just uses the fan right now & really likes it so much better than any other fans we own (which are a lot). She moves it from room to room with great ease wherever she wants it. (And she is 82 yrs old.) It looks good sitting in any room unlike normal fans. I had some small issues while cleaning my item that I called c.s. and they where extremely helpful. This has been such a positive experience for me. I spoke with Christine & she has followed up with me on my issue & helped & listened to me with much patience & kindness. She has gone above & beyond what I experience when calling other companies. She is one of the best c.s. reps I have ever dealt with. When I can afford to I probably will purchase another one of the units for another area of my house. BEST EVER COMPANY to deal with. BEST Customer Service Rep. (Christine) that I EVER dealt with. And my job before becoming ill was running a customer service area for another company. So as a past boss for a job that she is currently performing. I would hire her in a second. I would recruit her to work for me if I was still working. LOL!! GREAT JOB Christine!!|Positive
Very good quality and low price. Arrived quickly.|Positive
I am using this cooler in my attic. It is working fairly well. It looks pretty sleek too.|Positive
Living in Arizona, you need all the help you can get. We have it in our 10 x 30 enclosed back porch and it keeps us very comfortable - don't know how it will do when the humidity comes up in July September but for now it is great.|Positive
as advertised,worked great|Positive
It does not cool like a air condition but So far I am satisfy it cools down my living room on hot days, hotter days are coming I will see if it continue doing a good job cooling. Again I am very satisfy and surprise.|Positive
What is the purpose of the two separate pieces that fit on top of media?|Negative
Fits nicely and will work well to protect the unit throughout the winter months...also will keep the cold air from coming into the house.|Positive
Just dod do enough|Negative
I bought this item to cool a small bedroom. The fan functions wonderfully but it does not cool the space at all. I've tried the various tips I've seen in other's reviews but unfortunately they aren't working for me. I will say the item looks great, is easy to fill with water, and is not very loud. If I had bought this as a fan, I would be happy.|Negative
It's a very expensive fan. DoesbtD work for Tracy CA|Negative
A GREAT cooler, but BEWARE - the instructions are misprinted! We live in the desert north of Los Angeles where the temperature averages 90° and the humidity hovers around 10%. These are ideal conditions for an evap 'swamp' cooler, so I'm not sure why the description has 'not designed for use as an indoor air conditioner' because that's exactly what we use it for, with great success I might add. But BEWARE - the instructions are misprinted! Out of the box we waited nearly an hour for the room to cool down. Just as we were on the verge of returning the unit, we decided to take a 2nd look at the instruction manual figuring something must be wrong. We discovered that the symbols ON THE MACHINE DIAL are printed in reverse, and upside down, than the ones IN THE MANUAL. The symbols are as follows; 4 fan blades and a water drop = Hi-Fan w/ Cooling (Water Pump), 3 fan blades and a water drop = Low-Fan w/Cooling, 4 fan blades only = High-Fan only, 3 fan blades only = Low-Fan only, and lastly, a water drop only = Water Pump only. Check out the photos. Not only are the symbols reversed (left side vs right side), they are also upside down (high cool is on the bottom in the manual, but it’s at the top of the machine dial), the ‘power’symbol is now on the dial, not above it, and to top it all off, the machine symbols are stamped in white on pale tan/grey making them nearly impossible for these old eyes to make out! My guess is the company ordered a couple hundred thousand manuals printed then revamped the design of the machine dial. Come on, Hessaire, you guys make a great product, but I'd be willing to bet people have returned this cooler for these very reasons. Personally, I’d order a hundred thousand accurate stickers and hire some temp workers to stick them in the manuals over the old design. Voila - issue solved! No more confusion or returns. Everyone stays ‘cool’. PROS; This cooler does a GREAT job of cooling off high heat, low-humidity spaces. CONS; The instructions are misprinted and the wheels are impossible to push on (but that actually turned out to be a plus because with the wheels on we would not have been able to set the unit on a stool under the open window).|Positive
It's simple to set up and enjoy the cool! People at the first outdoor BBQ in May asked me how much did my A/C unit cost. 115 degrees and still works well outdoors in Phoenix.. I haven't looked into the pad or pump replacement cost yet..|Positive
Fits the opening like a glove and seals perfectly.|Positive
Easy assembly cools a two door garage no problem more than enough power and easy to roll very satisfied|Positive
"This is a really sturdy cover. It seems durable. The only drawback, in my opinion, is the velcro flap down the side, which generally would be a lace-up of some kind. I could tell after I fitted the cover over the cooler on our roof that the wind would blow open that velcro flap sooner or later, which would then pull the whole cover out of place. As a precaution, I took a handful of 1"" binder clips, the steel ones that hold together stacks of 60 or so pages, and I placed strips of duct tape at intervals along the velcro seam and then placed the binder clips over the taped areas. I used the duct tape first to prevent the clips from tearing into the canvas. Apart from that slight ""fix,"" the cover works perfectly, and it's nice and sturdy, so I expect it to last a few years."|Positive
The canvas worked.|Positive
Does not cool as well as something so huge should. Returned the cooler to Home Depot. It is a giant in size water evaporated quickly and just made the room feel hot and damp.|Negative
It burned up in 2 weeks|Negative
Cooler works great it is quite kind of wished I had purchased the larger one , but I'm happy.|Positive
Brilliant! Didn't know this existed. I used to have to get up off my butt to turn on or off the swamp cooler. This makes it all automatic.|Positive
I have been so impressed with this cooler! I use regular tap water with a little ice and the fan pumps out really cool air into the room. I actually surprised at how wonderfully it worked - this types of coolers can be hit or miss but this one was fantastic. The fan is quiet and the entire thing is really light weight.|Positive
Had guessed the size needed when purchasing a replacement and had to return it which posed no big deal. In the meantime, had to order the correct size which is the one pictured. Can't tell how well it's going to withstand the weather or for how long so I'll get back at'cha later.|Positive
This was purchased as a replaacement for a float valve that had aged and disintegrated. Once the old one was out the new one droppped in and fit perfectly|Positive
Doesn’t really blow out COLD AIR. Works more as a fan. Returned it|Negative
This cooler was less expensive, but you get what you pay for. It doesn't even cool a 100 sq ft room. Spend the extra money and get a bigger one!|Negative
The only issue is the pulley that came with the unit, the brand new pulley was warped so the belt will come off of the pulley if run at full-speed. Other than that the unit runs fine.|Negative
Over all, a good unit, nothing comes close to the CFM volume for the price. The hose connection is very weak. Make sure to get a pressure regulator so you don't blow the valve. The switch is weak and cheap. This unit does better as the humidity drops. Cooled the garage down 10 degrees.|Positive
I followed instructions as per manual and made sure this was used in a room with low humidity. I filled up the tank and even added the ice to the special reservoir. The room I used it in was about half the size of what this unit advertised it could handle. I checked the temperature (82 degrees) prior to turning the unit on and left it running for an hour and when I came back it showed 81 degrees. I also noticed a very foul smell which the manual says is due to the filter being new. I then left it running for another hour and came back and noticed the temperature still being 81 degrees. The company advertises that this unit can drop the temperature by as much as 20 degrees so considering the temperature essentially remained unchanged I consider this a completely useless product that simply does not work.|Negative
Great product, easy to set up and use. I highly recommend it.|Positive
the size is good, but it's noisymaybe other better options in the market for the same price or less|Negative
Fit perfect and easy to install .|Positive
Works great the only issue has been the little boy in the fountain as I like to call it. The water tends to track out of the pads and spills out through the inlet cover|Negative
Great product, delivered in record time from out of state.|Positive
This air cooler does just what I was told that it would: it cools a rather large area without having to pipe anything out the window. I haven't even needed to use the cool feature very much… the fan alone does a good job.|Positive
covers fit our coolers perfectly; we like that the canvas is sealed to preserve the fabric;|Positive
This works wonderful! Thanks for all your help. Will continue to shop at Home Depot, both in store and on line.|Positive
I had a portable AC unit I used in my garage that mysteriously quit and decided to try out an evaporative cooler as a replacement. The first thing to note is this is a cooler not conditioner. A conditioner uses a refrigerant to significantly reduce the temperature of the air (as in . A cooler uses water to absorb heat in the room and increases the humidity in the process. The effectiveness of a cooler depends on the current air humidity, current temp, and availability of fresh air to circulate. It should also be noted that over time the water will warm up so you either need to attach a hose line or be prepared to refill the tank as needed. To be scientific I took some measurements using my heat gun. Keep in mind results will vary based on the outdoor temp, humidity, etc. The unit should also be sized to the space you are trying to cool. I also used the hose connection but didn't add ice or anything that would have helped lower the water temp and increased the cooling effect. On the day I took measurements it was in the mid-80s (83-85) with 26% humidity. My east garage wall was about 100, west was 95, garage door was 100, and the garage ceiling was around 140. Cracking the garage door open half way for about 10 minutes while I setup the cooler only showed about a 3 degree drop in temp across these areas. When I measured the cooler air it was 68-72 degrees so a reasonable difference. After about an hour I saw a 9-10 degree drop on the walls and ceiling. Obviously I felt more comfortable but I needed a different baseline so I took the temperature of a tire and a block of wood and found they dropped in temperature 5-6 degrees after an hour as well. In short, this product does what it says and certainly made it easier to stay outside and work comfortably in my garage. You could also use this in a patio space as well; many restaurants do here in the summer on their patios.|Positive
It was pretty cheap inside compared to what I expected. It is ok, I guess.|Negative
Had to cut length to fit due to no one stocks my size but manufacturer. They perform and are cooler than the blue synthetic pads and I;'m satisfied.|Positive
I bought this unit cause it is cheaper than AC's and it uses less power. I wasn't looking for something to make a room cold but just to cool it down on those hot summer days. I put it next to a open window like the directions said and I left it on for a couple hours. when I returned to my room it was hot, muggy and humid. it does blow cold air but if its not directly hitting you, you will be hotter. I was not happy with the product at all. you are better off buying a big fan for less money and putting that by a window.|Negative
MasterCool used to be a good brand, but they went out of business a few years ago and was bought by a company that built the models using poor manufacturing. The steel is much thinner and they are screwed together instead of welded. Just the process of lifting it and placing it on the roof cased it to crumple on it's own weight and tear. I built some extra framing to hold it together and I'll nurse it along for a few years until it rusts away. Next time I'll spend the extra money and get a better one (the better ones can only be bought by plumbers).|Negative
I'm sure glad I bought this product. It kept my interior house temperature at around mid 70 degrees, while the outside temperature is 100+. My only little complaint about this product is that it made the inside air a bit damp, but I rather deal with that then the 100+ outside heat.|Positive
Waste of money.|Negative
The purchase was made to help our Kitchen Manager survive the hotter kitchen temperatures. The commercial stove generates so much extra heat that the make up air unit on the roof at 2100 CFM could not keep up.This 1000 CFM room cooler unit is just what was needed. Thank you|Positive
I was very satisfied with this product. It was shipped fast and it fit my old unit perfect.|Positive
As expected and would buy again and the free delivery was great|Positive
Perfect fit!|Positive
Even though it was larger than expected, but very light weight and moves easily it is very efficient in cooling my grand room of 300 sq ft. I had to turn it down to low because at high it was just too cold.|Positive
Was awesome thanks!|Positive
I had 2evaporative coolers on my roof they got old and a lot of repair so i bought the master cool 5000 downdraft had it installed it cools my whole house.|Positive
"The reason for the ""Good"" rating is I have to fill the water several times. It evaporates really fast. I have it in a screened in porch 8x10, placed at the end, and it does help kept the room cool even in 106 degree temp"|Positive
fit like a glove.easy to get.|Positive
I received this a couple weeks ago, and all I can say is WHERE HAS THIS BEEN? My family absolutely loves this. We have even seen a change in the quality of air we breathe and less bouts of allergies. I highly recommend this product|Positive
Easy to install. Little pricey but works well.|Positive
After 2 weeks' use it still has a rubber/chemical odor, whether its running or not. It also disappointed us because it doesn't cool the room air very much. It does add lots of humidity to the room air, so often that is as negative as the cooling is positive. It does work better if the water compartment is nearly full, but still not impressive. And, it's a very large unit - much larger & taller than I expected!|Negative
My wife & I first saw one of these units being used in a local resturant we frequent about a month ago and after inquiring about it from the manager I decided to buy one the next day to use in our two car garage at home and boy did it make a big difference. The cool air coming from our Hessaire evaporative cooler is so much nicer than just using a floor fan for circulating the hot air.|Positive
"Squirrel cage is mounted 3/8"" off of level which causes the fan to wobble. The louvered panels that hold the cooler pads slide too far downward ,which require a crowbar to remove every time."|Negative
I live in a desert climate and loved this cooler. I keep it in my master bedroom and use the ice packs it comes with on especially hot days. It adds a nice amount of moisture to the air and works efficiently. For night time use, it's especially nice since it has several settings and comes with a remote.|Positive
I own a small business here in San Diego and to instal AC it just was not feasible, so I purchased this cooler and I am very pleased with it. It cools my shop area just enough to make it bearable if not comfortable. I would suggest you place to cooler near an open window or open door to get the best results from the cooler. I really am thrilled with it. My space here is commercial so we get no breeze and it gets 90 degrees in here. I would say the cooler dropped the temp 10+ degrees and it is quite and the oscillating fan is fantastic! It very powerful and it covers the whole room with an even spread of airflow. The price was very reasonable also. The wheels seem more heavy duty than others I saw on different brands. Hope this helps.|Positive
This saved me on the days where it was 90 INSIDE! Ice makes it much cooler, but it does obviously make the air a bit more humid.|Positive
This cooler cools down the room really well. It is also a lot cheaper to run then a window air conditioner. You have to fill the cooler once a day which last most of the day. Don't forget to clean the filter after you fill. Leave one window open about 12 inches next to the cooler. I'm going to purchase another cooler for the bedroom and take out the window air conditioner. I would highly recommend this product to people that live in dry climates.|Positive
It works.. its not super fantastic or anything, its a pump for water. squirts water over the AC fine with no installation problems (because its simple as simple can be) and it turned on. What else do you need it to do?|Positive
Well crafted.|Positive
Slim Profile is good. BUT....... Heat Flexes the Plastic BAD! You can't see or adjust the float during operation. Found that when the weather heats up (that's why we buy coolers) the plastic becomes flexible. Unfortunately, the float valve is attached to this flexing plastic frame and the weight of the float arm causes any adjustments to be worthless. To re-adjust, you need to disassemble the entire piece (pain in the backside). Once adjusted by 'guesswork', put it all back together, fill it up and you can only tell if it works if you don't go dry or overflow. Understand this: You can't see or adjust the float during operation. Adjustments are futile because heat distorts any adjustments you make. Found I had to use wire on the outside to tie up the inlet hose to make adjustments.|Negative
This was erroneously listed as 1300 cfm when I bought it, then they fixed the listing before it arrived. I was mad about that so I figured I'd probably return it. However, after getting it and putting it to use, I found it to be a pretty ideal size, near the max you'd want in a portable unit. Flaws include; The fill port is not the lowest drainage point so if you overfill it comes out the back of the unit. Works fine if you fill in the tub like me. For want of a 75-cent relay, the pump keeps running when out of water, making noises not unlike angry mechanical indigestion and wasting energy/wearing the pump. My stupid 8 dollar humidifier turns off when it is out of water, come on guys. Due to more lazy design, the last (3/4?) gallon doesn't get used. Should have put the pump in a recess on the bottom. For you fellow mathematically inclined people out there here is some great info: With good conditions (humidity 20 percent or so) this thing rocks, dropping temps from 85 on the intake side to 64 on the outlet side, that feels great. Evaporating water absorbs 8-9,000 btu of energy in the process of evaporation. This can evaporate about 4 gallons of water in 8 hours on low and 5 hours on high, meaning this thing puts out about 4-6,000 btu of real cooling power. That's comparable to a very small window unit. Of course it depends on many factors but you get the point. Run it outside of your bedroom, pointed in through half open door, with box fan on low blowing air out a window. You can hardly hear it and you can really feel it, even on low!|Positive
I just popped it in and it worked. No fuss, muss or bust!|Positive
It really only brings the temperature down about five degrees Fahrenheit and that is from about five feet away.|Negative
I purchased this device in April 2012 (it might have been May) and it is mid-July 2012 and it has fallen apart. 1) First off, how are you supposed to put water in this thing? Seriously? There's a tiny little hole in the front for water. If you use a hose you are GUARANTEED to get water all over your floor at some point. And to be quite honest you are guaranteed to get water all over your floor ANYWAY with this thing. 2) The first thing to go out is the fill water indicator. Won't last a week. 3) Then it worked for a couple of months. But, what will go out next? Not the pump like people think.. but the OTHER water fill indicator. The one for the pump. And if it goes out.. guess what? IT DOESN'T WORK. So, I took it apart and snipped the wire on that device to get the pump to work. And by the way, look at that genius piece of engineering. I've yet to figure out how it is SUPPOSED to work. So, I can't recommend this. This is my last evaporative cooler. You spend $300 on these things and they end up costing you that much (water damage if nothing else). You might save $300 on your electricity but then the room is humid (I do live in Las Vegas). They're not worth it. Just turn on the AC.|Negative
Does what I expected|Positive
Works great! I have a lot of open doors in my dog boarding facility and it's keeping the dogs cool in 3 digit heat.|Positive
This unit comes with no motor and no control panel. That was OK for me because I was replacing an existing unit, but the hookups don't match my old Champion unit. No instructions. Lion Home Service out of Fort Collins gave me an estimate of $946!! to install. One side panel fits poorly.|Negative
I installed valve in a whole house humidifier 2 months ago and so far works great. Valve is hardly audible when filling reservoir. Had to decrease water pressure to valve in order for valve to shut off, only due to lack of water pressure on float due to a small reservoir. Much better than the plastic one that came with humidifier.|Positive
The cover was easy to install, fit well, and seems to be of good quality. I installed it a couple months ago, so I can't report on its long term durability yet.|Positive
Good pulley for the price, plus picking up at store saved shipping cost .|Positive
They where easy to install|Positive
works as expected. not air conditioning but good for what it is. if you expect this to cool like an air conditioner look for something that is an air conditioner. but if you just need it, like i do, to cool yourself down in the garage working on projects then this will do a nice job. by the way i live in las vegas and i put chilled water in the unit.|Positive
The cooler has met all our expectations so far. We had some 100 degree days and with the low humidity, we only needed to run the cooler on low. Very compact and installed easily. We put a thermostat in the electric line and it cycles well. We are very happy with the cooler! We purchased the flush pump kit as our water is pretty hard and requires frequent flushing.The cooler drops the outside air temp by about 25 degrees on the hottest days. This cooler is not as noisy as the last cooler we had. Overall, we are pleased.|Positive
I can't really tell if it works or not because the day I hooked it up the humidity went over 30% and hasn't dried up since.|Negative
This cooler is great for cooling our cabin in the desert. It works great and is less expensive than an air conditioner. The first cooler we bought ran night and day for months on end and lasted two years. Although it only needed a new knob, we decided to buy another one. We will repair the first one and use in another building.|Positive
Purchased for second pump in swamp cooler to remove waste water. Tested system before it was installed on the roof works great cooler waste water is removed in 3 minute and then fresh water returns flushing lower sump area out in about 1 minutes waste water pump is then shut off and the unit is clean ready to go.|Positive
The dux work ok, but, there are a few drawbacks. 1. I would go into the attic to make sure that your chosen install location is clear of obstructions. 2. I haven't heard of anyone else complaining about this problem, so I haven't come up with a fix for it yet. The problem is that when the wind blows, the spring loaded lid flaps up and down. It makes a heck of a racket, so forget about sleep. However, this is when the cooler is off. When the cooler is on, this won't be a problem due to positive pressure keeping the vent lid open. The company should make the spring pressure a bit stiffer, or a way to lock the lid down. This would especially be useful in the winter when you wouldn't want the vent to open at all. The insulator sheet that slips into the vent grill, does not provide much insulation, or noise barrier. I can say with some assurance, that had I known what I know now, I would not have bought the up-dux. It would have been much cheaper and a lot less work to just open the dang windows.|Negative
I've had this unit for just over a year now and I can say it's been disappointing since the start. The quality is very low, the sheet metal is so thin it can be easily bent by hand. Like others I've found loose 'extra' hardware floating around inside from lazy people on the assembly line just grabbing new stuff when they've dropped what they were threading on. Since the sheet metal is so thin the screws that hold the sides in strip out on first install if they're not already stripped when you remove them. Nuts with shoulders were used for assembly, some are installed upside down. Squirrel cage is crazy out of balance, you can watch it wobble back and forth. And for costing nearly $500 it doesn't come with a motor!!! Would you buy a new car with no motor?? And after only a year of use it has some pretty serious rust issues. The unit it replaced was in use here for over 30 years and was used when we installed it. Even in its advanced age it's still more solid then this Champion unit. I seriously doubt I'll get five years out of this. Complete garbage with no quality control standards in place at the manufacture. The ONLY thing I can say in its favor is that it cools very well. But obviously it won't be doing it for a long time.|Negative
Works well. Float sticks ocaisionally.|Positive
"We use our cooler to supplement our ""swamp"" cooler here in Albuquerque, NM. Have been very pleased with it's ability to cool our living space. Very easy to use and appears to be nicely constructed."|Positive
works verywell !!!!!!|Positive
This is basically a fan (and a moderately weak one at that). It had no noticeable impact in 140 sq ft. tent. I'll either try to re-sell it or return it.|Negative
The product was difficult to install Most pumps are plug in, this one is a hard wire and you have to take the cooler apart to wire it . Keep it simple for parts that you know are going to have to be replaced.|Negative
The unit works well, but leaks a little. I've been unable to isolate the leak so I put a pan under it in order to keep the carpet dry. It's a tiny amount of moisture and evaporates very quickly. Not enough to return the item.|Positive
Outstanding!|Positive
Easy to install, easy to hook up and works great. I would recommend it.|Positive
Returned the unit after two days. Day one was great. Day two the pump stopped working. $250??? You must be kidding.|Negative
Oh this unit is alot more expensive than other units. But it has ridged media. It only pulls air from 2 sides. And is alittle smaller than others. BUT it is way better at cooling than the most expensive aspen cooler. It droped the temps to 69 degrees in my house. The other unit would only get it down to 74 degrees. My only complaint is it is Noisier on high due to the grill they have put on it. It has the screen on top of the grill that I think is the cause of the additional noise. I can live with the additional noise to have 69° in the house. I recommend this unit whole heartedly|Positive
Great unit . Easy setup. Cools my greenhouse and don't have to worry if it runs out of water. Would recommend.|Positive
The pads were easy to install and worked great|Positive
Does not produce cool air when outside temp exceeds 100degrees. Even in low desert humidity .|Negative
Great portable cooler unit|Positive
I was quite dissapointed in the fit and finish of this unit. This unit was full of unused bolt holes, the water basin was a little bent up. The sheet metal screws attaching the water pump were both stripped out and the disc on the bottom of the water pump needed to be reattached. The biggest problem with this cooler is that the pulleys between the motor and fan are misaligned. The motor does not have a horizontal adjustment to remedy this. I bought this cooler because it is made by an American business and I expected a little better quality than it's Chinese counterpart. However after receiving the cooler I would have to recommend buying a different brand, the Chinese coolers are higher quality for less money.|Negative
Product returned - broken & wpuld not work.|Negative
The ac unit came assembled and started right up with just plugging it in. The air pressure is adjustable and so are the vents. I would recommend this ac to anyone needing one at a good price for a great product. I would definitely purchase it again if I needed another one.|Positive
Works perfectly on our porch on hot Louisiana days! Well built , great value Thanks Home Depot!|Positive
We have been looking for a second swamp cooler for our houseboat, temps on the lake can reach 110F. Capacity (5 gallons), 3 speeds, oscillating vanes, and a remote are all helpful for the price. It's more compact than our other 5 gallon coolers so that helps in tight spaces. It does cool our cabin 10-15F and provides a consistent breeze. Only complaint are the wheels which don't like to change directions.|Positive
The cover fit our swamp cooler perfectly. Good quality, heavy duty canvas.|Positive
"I purchased this product to replace the existing 28""x40""x8"" pads, and there's a huge gap. Even with using the styrofoam spacers from the old set, there'a a gap. So these are literally about 2"" too short. For $90 you'd think they could at least manage to fill the space they're supposed to. They do not. I would return them but I'm disabled and the idea of having to go back up on the roof dismantle the thing, pack it back into the box and return it and then find somewhere else with a decent product that fits is just too much for me right now. But I would say do not buy this. It's about an inch too small width wise."|Negative
Purchased this cooler for our patio.....works GREAT!!!!!!! My wife was skeptical when I purchased this, but now we both love it. we use it daily. Awesome to have wheels, so that I can move it into the garage when I am doing projects there. I highly recommend this cooler.|Positive
It was exactly what I needed.|Positive
Perfectly replaced the pads in my cooler.|Positive
Good deal. I installed it and works great. I would recommend it.|Positive
makes room very humid and doesn't cool it down like it said it would. also its a 5 gallon tank so i thought it would hold water for a period of time but i end up having to refill 5 gallons of water a day in it just to cool a room like 4 degrees at most|Negative
Very nice material and fit smoothly over the air conditioner. Will be great protection over the winter.|Positive
Cons - Have a 800 Sqft space and barely cools half of it! Had to order two more smaller ones to help circulate and cool the air Pros - Don't have to fill it, the hose adapter works well|Negative
Did not work better than a fan.|Negative
Great cooler and fan. It took two refills of water to get rid of the odor. I recommend the cooler cleaning solution biweekly to kill the batería/mold.|Positive
Very satisfied|Positive
It is not an Air Conditioner ! But it will keep you comfortable, I am enjoying it.|Positive
The advertisement for this cover says it is oversized so I ordered the exact size. However it wasn't oversize and I ripped it trying to get it on the cooler.|Negative
cover snapped on well. good fit. also purchased an outside cover to protect the rest of the cooler after i winterize it..|Positive
Purchase this item for a friend,it works great.|Positive
Generally good cooler for Fresno, CA. Fits close to the wall, color blends well, not difficult to install, (EXCEPT getting the back on), fairly efficient in our climate, relatively quiet (for a cooler), seems sturdy and long-lasting after 4 years, filters last a few years (depending on hard water in your area)... BUT, it is so hard to mount the back (holds the filter media). Here's why: the water distribution hose is too short so it's very hard to do everything at once with the back resting in place with a little gap for your fingers - attach hose end to top nipple and secure clamp, get the hose into its track/clamps along frame, NOT pinch the bottom of the hose where the frame pushes against it, AND get the back pushed on without injuring your fingers in the process. I think this would be called a design flaw, but seems the company is unresponsive to this issue. Even the customer service head in Phoenix had the exact same problems. He said to replace the clamp with a typical hose clamp (make sure to get it out of the way of frame), get a longer hose...and watch your fingers! We have hard water so have to use more maintenance: spray out the pads maybe yearly, use white vinegar spray on filter pads frequently, use bleed off line (customer service says it bleeds 1 gallon/hour and you could direct it to your plants), use special in-line filters also sold by HD. And little white flecks of mineral deposits DO end up inside your room caused by the mineral buildup. But I do like the unit. Wish the company were more responsive to customer issues. Buy a longer hose immediately!!!|Positive
I knew this was not an air conditioner and is intended to work in higher humidity areas by cooling the air by running cool water through it. I liked the ability to add ice to the top. It has a really good fan that can oscillate back and forth. Looks nice on our patio and seems to cool very well.|Positive
Temperature here in Reno has been over 90 degrees all summer with 15 days being over 100. The cooler has been a life saver. The cooler is being used in my bedroom, not only does it keep me cool all night but provides moisture in the air that stops my nosebleeds and cracked lips. What a great machine and quiet too.|Positive
Very pleased with this purchase .The product is well made and performs as advertised.|Positive
Fits and performs well for a evaporative cooler replacement motor.|Positive
Well built, could do with a larger screw foe float adjustment|Positive
only lasted 3 days|Negative
Great product for the price Like the swing feature on the discharge|Positive
Cooler works great in my shop. Would recommend for anyone looking to cool down their shop on the hot summer days|Positive
The cover was easy to install and fit excellent. I wish there were straps to tighten the areas of the cover that are not touching (directly under the outlet) to give a tighter and more secure fit. The drawstring at the bottom that pulls it tight is not enough to ensure a very snug fit to not allow wind etc. in. There was a definite reduction in airflow after adding the cover even tough I already had insulation stuffed in the outlet coming into the house. I still felt a draft even with this in place, but after putting the cover on there was a definite difference. I am pleased with the cover for the price so far. Seems very durable and will hopefully get many more years of use out of it. I am not sure it would be warm enough or block enough of the outside elements if I did not have the insulation stuffed into the air cavity that blows air into the home. (Sorry I don't know the technical term).|Positive
Cover is a lot nicer and higher quality than i expected. My evaporative coooler is on the side of my house out of the sun and weather so i expect this to last a long time. It is a nice size and it fits a little big. I put in on the cooler to see how it fits but the real test will be this winter. It is a nicer cover then ones i have dealt with in the past.|Positive
blows cool air...just not all over the room and believe me, my room is small. My apt. is only about 800 sq feet and I'm trying to cool the living/kitchen area. It does blow good cold air when it has its ice pack in it or just ice cubes but I'm still hot in the house.|Negative
Really easy plugin add water cool down really easy to take apart and clean has a pretty good size tank for water and let you know when water is low .|Positive
I f u follow the simple instructions this was an extremely easy install. The unit is so efficient I rarely turn it above lowest setting. At 109 outside it was 72 in my office, on medium setting. I have used others that never did that well. Amazing product. Happy customer here. Moms house now has one and dads is next. Highly recommend this to anyone in a hot low humidity area.|Positive
Returned unit for the following reasons: 1 Would not cool a 15’x13’ room 2. The product has a large Orange card with the owners manual stating “ An Odd Odor occurs for the first two hours of operation and this is normal” This is an understatement, the odor does not go away after two hours and is still lingering in our room when the machine is ran after 10 hours 3. The noise from the fan and water cycling through the filter is too loud to sleep.|Negative
Good replacement pads for my swamp cooler. Well wrapped in mesh and fit in easily. Work well. My old ones were a little more plush, but they were the originals.|Positive
has 5/8 shaft not 1/2 also it needs the cord as well|Negative
"The cooler cover fabric is very high quality. I'm very hopeful that it will last a long time. My only complaint is with the ""open"" seam, the closure mechanism could be much more sound. A zipper, snaps or something more continuous would be better than the rope/loops that are currently used. Overall I'm impressed with the quality and hope to see it on the roof for many year. Oh ya, I also like that its not blaze yellow like my previous cover. The grey is more muted and less ""in your face"". I also have grey trim, so it fits in nicely."|Positive
Excellent product - performs exactly as advertised. Cools my patio deck making a very pleasant experience on a hot afternoon.|Positive
This is not a quality built cooler. The shroud, that fits through the window, does not have a seal where it is secured to the main body by metal machile screws causing a gap for air to leak through. The selector switch is at a slight angle due to mounting hole in the housing not square to the face.|Negative
Only had it a very short time,but appears to be very well made & gets the job done. So Far So|Positive
Great!|Positive
The cover fit well|Positive
Prior to my purchase of this product, I've used a heavy-duty fan blowing right on my all night long. The problem there is the fan blows air regardless of temperature. During summer my bedroom would be hot of very stuffy by morning. NOW, that I have this evaporative cooler, my bedroom isn't stuffy and isn't hot in the morning. LOVE THIS MACHINE! I've already recommended to friends!! Since I take my cooling seriously I waited a couple of weeks before writing my review. My only regret - that I didn't find this sooner! My bedroom is probably 12 x 15 to give you an idea of the size. Oh, I will mention that I start the cooler up about an hour before I go to bed so the room has had a chance to cool and I can run this all night on medium and I still have plenty of water in the reservoir, which means I could run it on high alll night and be fine. I run it on fan mode so the white noise is consistent. The other settings mix up the high, low, off, etc. and that's harder for me block out than a consistent sound. So, I use Speed at low or medium, swing, fan, and I chose both ion and cool air options. Thrilled to say the least!!|Positive
The Ithem fit perfectly and was exactly what I wanted.|Positive
The works well for what it does! It will cool the room by maybe 10 degree by my estimate. So if it's gonna be 100 degrees out, it won't do the job as say a regular AC, but this is gonna run a lot cheaper in cost. However for LA if the room is say 90, going down to an 80 is a big help. Remote works well and changing the water is a breeze. Also comes with some ice pack things which do make a big difference. When I bought it, I had several friends ask me about it and I'd definitely recommend. Conventional fan that uses basic science of using water to cool the room. If you are thinking about getting one of these, likely you should just get it. I'm happy with mine. Also was delivered on time as expected.|Positive
Does what is stated to do. Well constructed and excellent customer service from the manufacturer for one minor issue. It is saving me money every day. Just remember during higher humidity water cooler are not as effective. In areas where humidity is typically high these are not a viable option.|Positive
Works well except on High cooling speed the fan makes a lot of noise. Too much trouble to dismount and return for exchange.|Positive
Works great,installed easily,should come with pulley. I had to go back an buy one.|Positive
we love it and were telling everyone it keeps us cool|Positive
I use this product on the lanai. It works well|Positive
4 stars, one screw was striped on the cover plate.all the rest is excellent.|Positive
WORKS WELL, NICE COOLER|Positive
these coolers are great...UNTIL you need a part then you are out of luck. no support, no website I loved it until I needed a new pump which is not available. Not like the Depot to be so unprepared. And this product is otherwise very good, its just a short term solution but rather expensive. I would not buy it again.|Negative
Steer clear of this thing! 1) Control unit is SUPER sensitive and dies easily I've had to replace it 4 times at $97 a pop. Also, the cheap plastic cover to hold the control unit together has flimsy plastic clips which break ever so easily. You'll want to strangle the designer as much as I wanted to! And the filter costs WHAT -- OVER $100 compared to a $5 straw one -- that's where the cost goes through the roof. You'll cry when you have to pay this much for 3 pieces of cardboard. And the expensive filter easily allows bugs to crawl through it(I had to install window screen to the outside). It also sprays too much water, then leaks down the wall from the back where the fan motor bracket attaches to the frame -- Use silicon (this caused some drywall damage). I cut a hole in the exterior stucco wall so I'm stuck with this nightmare of a thing! The whole purchase is regretful. AVOID THIS THING! If I can save one of you, my work was worth while! I hope the company FAILS for making such CHEAP, YET EXPENSIVE GARBAGE!|Negative
THE PRODUCT IS GREAT SO FAR I HAVENT INSTALLED IT YET. ONE THING THAT TICTED ME OFF WAS IT WAS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A 5HP MOTOR, ITS GOT A 1/2 HP|Positive
Works great out of the box , easy to operate. Would recomend to anyone.|Positive
i have a 600 sq ft shop. this cooler cools it off really well. I open a door on one end and another on the opposite side. it will cool my shop dowm by 30 degrees. makes it very confortable. in the desert of California.really quiet too|Positive
everything was included even the pump. Great! What I'd like to have had is an easy way to adapt to the duct on the roof which was off by a few inches from the cooler opening. Duct tape solved it but it should be easier and more universal to connect.|Positive
Did not get very cool|Negative
New pads make working outside comfortable again, cool days|Positive
It's pretty loud, but does cool off my big living room and makes it more comfortable. Hard to hear the tv when it's on.|Positive
The water feature does not improve the room temp. It sucks up a lot of water.|Negative
Very please with the product, I had no problem installing it, works well.|Positive
Home Depot now carries the replacement CELdek pad media online! It says it's for the 5500CFM model, but will actually work with all the Durango models to date. I installed through-wall in my uninsulated, 1000 sf, 1955 house. I love it! Installed in the back bedroom, and it blows straight down the hall to the rest of the house. It was 92 yesterday, and humidity was 10%. The Durango on low was blowing 58 degree, fresh, clean air. House dropped from 82 to 70 in under two hours. Ran it in fan only mode that night, to bring in the nice 56 degree night air. As with all evaporative coolers, you need to make sure you have adequate venting (windows open) to allow to humid air to exit the interior. Servicing the unit could be easier, if they would have used socket head cap screws, instead of phillips head screws. A small amount of water travels down the seam, between cover and case, and drips from back right hand corner. Will be calling Bonaire for a solution to that minor issue. Here are the power consumption figures for a 4500 CFM Bonaire Durango: Off. Watts / Volt-Amps / Power Factor: Manual Mode 0 / 0 / 1.00 Remote Mode .3 / 2 / .15 Fan mode. Watts / Volt-Amps / Power Factor: Low 191 / 222 / .88 Med 251 / 287 / .87 High 325 / 400 / .81 Cooling Mode. Watts / Volt-Amps / Power Factor: Low 207 / 245 / .84 Med 265 / 312 / .84 High 342 / 426 / .80 SCE offers a $200 rebate for installing these units. Many other Power Companies offer similar rebates. These units also make a great whole house fan, bringing in the cool night air.|Positive
Our old cooler with the same size motor, had much better air output, this cooler hardly moves the air.If I could have seen one in operation, I would never have bought it. The cfm on my old cooler could not be determined.|Negative
When it hit record highs here in southwest Washington, and the relative humidity was in the 20s I thought for sure that this evaporative air cooler would work. I'm sure it will work fine for those of you living in areas where the hum-ditty (as my father used to say) is less than 50%. However, during another recent hot-spell here, the relative humidity it never got below about 56%. So, it could not effectively cool the air. Sadly, I had to return it.|Negative
I could not use this sill cock. the fitting used with this thing leaked. so I wasted my money on this contraption. it is now on a self used and I cannot use it leaks. very disappointed with home depot.|Negative
Works good. I think the 300 sq. ft range is a bit optimistic. Fan output is a bit low. Have it in the garage. Previously only had a fan. Found that if I use the NewAir in conjunction with the existing fan, it works really well. Blows the cool air around better. EZ to load water & ice.|Positive
Small size, big performance|Positive
This filter is a great lower cost alternative for the Bonair Durango Evap Cooler. Fit perfectly.|Positive
I sustained a rip in the Hurricane Boat Cover due to a water pooling issue, and once I faxed the form and picture of the rip, they promptly sent me a new cover. They even offered to send me 2 support poles for free. The service was the best and quickest I have ever received from an online company.|Positive
While the ordering system for pickup in the store was a mess, the actual item is good and I recommend it.|Positive
Product is great in my 5th wheel. Bought the larger one and froze me out. This one is perfect. Larger one is now on my patio. Temps here are 108-115 in AZ and cools great! Hessaire makes good products. I suggest you try there cooler mugs also. Ice stays ice over 8 hours!|Positive
The turbine cover is durable and easy to install. It comes with a cord so it can be secured to the turbine and won't come off in heavy wind storms. This produce should last for many years with proper care.|Positive
Installed in less than an hour, works like a champ. Keeps house about 20+ degree cooler than outside temp in New Mexico. cm|Positive
I rated the fan average because it works fairly well but not as cool as I expected|Negative
Very cool. And the water is last long. I like it.|Positive
Very reasonable price and fits like a glove.|Positive
No grille cover included which is needed for obvious reasons. Float location is ridiculous. Customer service won't respond to communication. Not happy with product.|Negative
I have one comment - the side discharge evaporative cooler has a chain support on each side of the cooler. The cover I bought does not have any access holes for the chain support. I had to poke 2 holes in the cover to accommodate the chain s-hooks.|Positive
I HAVE USED THESE PREVIOUSLY, and i am VERY HAPPY with PERFORMANCE and QUALITY.|Positive
"It was difficult to install due to weight. U need 2 strong men. The provided chains (2) did not seem sufficient for this weight. We supported it further with a ""shelf"" with brackets underneath. The water inlet hole for tube was located on the ""wrong"" side for us. We removed a rubber plug on the opposite side to make insertion easier. The channels that distribute the water to the pads were very, very, lightweight (aluminum?). At least they shouldn't rust. The plastic panels that fill in spaces left over on either side of the window: if you have newer windows with exact right angles it is better; otherwise it is difficult to not leave spaces on parts of the perimeter. These small spaces can be filled quite easily with about any non-degradable material that can be wadded up. May not look the best, but it suffices. Hopefully this cooler will last many years, which is the real test of quality"|Positive
Middle of our second season with this cooler, so far have had to replace the pump and bearings. Has never cooled as well as our previous cooler that was rated at less CFM and lasted over 20 years with only replacing 1 pump and a motor after 15 years.|Negative
"These things stink. Installed them in my cooler and they stunk. Cleaned the cooler, cleaned the new pads, installed deodorizer tablet, still stunk. Ran it daily for almost 3 weeks to ""air out"" and it never did. Finally just put the old ones back in last night and no more stink. Don't waste your $$."|Negative
Works great, no problems.|Positive
FOR THE LAST TIME REORDERED UNIT BECAUSE THIS WAS TOO SMALL! THIS MEANS THAT IT WAS RETURNED, SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY RATE THIS ONE!!|Positive
My 6500 pulls a lot of water. but this will do the job as long as everything else is clear of any debris. cooler has worked better with a bigger pump, but so far it's been keeping up, just just barely.|Negative
worked great, had it up and in place in a few hours.|Positive
Works great! When used with the ice, it cools shaded patio in FL summer|Positive
My house is nice and cool. The evaporator cooler was so easy to connect. Make sure you purchase the down draft.|Positive
Works well as long as there’s some air flow from behind. It does go through water very fast. But it definitely does the job for my room.|Positive
This is perfect for my place, I did mount it in the wall by making a wood frame then using plaster of paris to seal it in ... i also removed the pad to add fiberglass screen inside the intake grid to keep bugs out.. It works great and is so cheap to run.. at only 0.62 amps.|Positive
This evaporator is good only one Lil problem the float that comes with it is not of good quality had to adjust several times and tightened it several times. Working fine now. Runs great! I did receive it slightly dented on top from when they shipped it to the store. Not happy about that.|Positive
I love the way Champion makes their coolers. All parts are bolted together-not welded-which is good for me because I have to take the unit up the ladder to the roof by myself-a one-man show. I can dissassemble the Champion. on the ground and reassemble it on the roof. I also like the fact that all of the parts can be replaced if needed. Plus there aren't any welded seams on the ones I have inspected which means less places for rust and corosion to hide. Two thumbs up to Champion for a great product.|Positive
Fit perfectly|Positive
Works like a champ....just the grill makes alil noise but cools house down good|Positive
Very light and easy to move around without the water. Even with water, it is easy to move on a hard floor. Was difficult to fill because I have a bad back . Also , it is IMPOSSIBLE to see the fill line for the water, so I just wing it. Works well for average size room. don't use above 20% humidity.|Negative
This thing has made an enormous difference during those hot. summer days. Quickly cools a room down and maintains a very comfortable temperature.|Positive
First I want to say I have had Brisa evaporative coolers and they are very good products. However, I returned this model because the dimensions don't match the model in the picture. This cooler is much wider than the one in the picture. Check dimensions!|Positive
So Far So Good - no problems so far. The position and placement of the water outlet valve is in the more forward position so the water isn't hitting my plastic liner inside my mastercool ASA51 - had to return the last one because it was running down the wall. This float is better positioned and doesn't have that problem. Much Better|Positive
I think the cfm rating is very questionable and im already getting a random squeek from it.It does blow pretty cool but you need to be in front of it.|Negative
The product is as stated and serves the need. The pricing was fair, comparable to other options. The service at the store was not up to par.|Positive
good quality|Positive
Good product with a reasonable price|Positive
The pan and top was dented, very bad on the bottom, but not completely through. It was 108 degrees and had no choice but to install it otherwise die in the heat. I tool pictures. This is my 4th Champion and never had this happen, very poor handling Home Depot. Sue Moreland|Negative
This heat plug is perfect for me. It was actually to thick for what I needed the foam In side the cover was 2 peices so I removed the one and fits perfectly now. No air coming in from the outside. Perfect!|Positive
This product has a really good fan quality but not a really good cooling quality. So, if you are looking for a really good fan,this is a good choice, but if you're looking for a step down from an a/c look elsewhere.. Only good if temps are below 75 degrees.. Not for extremely hot climates..|Negative
This is a quality product right out of the box.The only question I have is, will it last for more then a season ? The pumps that are marketed by the company that make Master cool are cheap junk. I've been looking for alternative product for years now,maybe this is it. Only time will tell.|Positive
They were just like the original pillow block bearing‘s Making it a quick and easy replacement|Positive
We originally had a 6500 CFM Mastercool unit. It lasted 22 years & if we had really tried, we could have repaired the pillow block bearings that wore out. Instead, we opted to buy a new 7000 cfm Mastercool from Home Depot. It was a great decision. We're very happy with it.|Positive
Fit our unit just right.|Positive
Great design, works great. I really like it! Turn on right out of the box. The power cord is a very awkward when storing.|Positive
The only assembly required is to attach the casters. It can take some effort to push them into the mounting holes on the bottom. The fan works very well with two speeds on my model (1300). I use the unit indoors. It cools my bedroom at night just fine with a box fan in the window blowing air out. However, I really need to sit in front of the unit when I'm using it during the day or evening. It is too hot to cool the entire room (150 sq ft w/room temperature at 100+ degrees in Las Vegas). I've had two problems with the unit. The hose connecting the pump to the water distributor was zip-tied to the top of the inside of the unit. It was tied so tight that it created a bend in the hose that impeded water flow. I had to remove the zip-tie and place a clip on the hose to remove the bend. Water flows properly now. The second problem is more serious. The unit leaks. The unit had three hard plastic components. Water leaks from the seams between the components on one side of the unit. Oddly it doesn't always leak. I can't recommend the unit because of this issue. I'd like to know if there is an easy fix for this problem.|Negative
I bought two of these. They do an okay job at cooling down my two bedrooms. However, one of them leaks out of the back. Its a slow drip and I have to have it sit on a plastic shoe mate/crate. If you have it on all night it leaks around a pitcher of water.|Negative
our 3300 CFM 2speed window evaporative cooler is fantastic and keeps is cool and happy, and its charge on the electric bill is so much lower than an air conditioner. We love it, thanks Home Depot!|Positive
Excellent product,It fit perfectly and is good quality canvas. It will take some time to see how it holds up over a few winters. Would recommend.|Positive
I really like this unit. I had been looking for a portable air conditioner that did not need to be vented to the outside. This definitely fits that bill. Only two complaints - There need to be better instructions regarding how much water to put in the machine, how frequently you need to refill due to rate of evaporation, and a way to easily tell how full the tank is. Also, the plastic opening for filling the tank broke after just one day's use (It still works okay, but it doesn't lie flush anymore).|Positive
Best AC purchase I made so far. A bit expensive, but so far worth the purchase.|Positive
I had bought a smaller unit last summer and it worked ok but not great. This unit came on sale and the deal was too good to pass up. SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT!!!!! It works great. 105 outside in Phoenix and this thing is blowing 70 inside. I have it up against an open window on one side of the house with a fan blowing outward on the opposite side of the house. Works great. Gets a bit humid at the end of the day but very cool inside. Never got over 77 in the house when it was 105 all last week and I never turned on the AC. Only drawback, it goes through so much water. I have to fill it every 2 to 4 hours. Can't use the hose setup in my house so that means carrying a lot of water every few hours. Cleaning is a pain too. Still, it saved me around $100 in the first month alone.|Positive
Great price, not sure how long the straps will last.|Positive
Easily installed and adjusted. No dribble when shut off!|Positive
Very dissappointed. The equipment doesn't blow fresh air not even with ice in the water compartment , I used in a single room very small and a barely feel the air fresh. I have two more coolers and I know what I'm talking about.|Negative
Just received my new Luma air a few days after we went thru Hurricane Florence in N.C. Most wonderful thing I have ever used. The air here right now is so humid and sticky and this item just send air all thru the house. Very quiet but has strong steel blade and rotating vents to distribute air evenly. Thank you to the folks who assisted me when my old unit broke down right before the storm hit.|Positive
It has so much power it made the paint peel in the dinning room ceiling, it uses to much water to use in the house, but it will be great out on the patio.|Negative
A little more expensive than I hoped it would be but fits perfectly in my cooler.|Positive
Doesn’t cool very goodIt is a 300-400 sf room|Negative
I have had this cooler for about 2.5 years, and I have NEVER had a problem with it! I have lived in several smaller homes, and this cooler is more then capable of keeping the entire house cool! VERY LOW maintnence, low cost to run and best of all it will run for years to come! I even talked my Brother and his wife into getting one, and they have never had a problem with theres either! I recommend this product to anyone and eveyone looking for a great little machine as a great price! You WONT be dissapointed!!!|Positive
they work|Positive
This updated model has a slight size difference (as it's extension is fitted into the wall), so there is some work / ingenuity required to properly get it fixed like you want it. But it functions as you expect and desire it to, if you had the older model (10+ years old). Look for cost savings and enjoy!|Positive
Excellent materials, Surprisingly they fit perfectly the size of my turbine was 18W x 20L. I got lucky|Positive
"1st off the on-line instructions says requires 22"" hole it does not , Hole is 19 3/4"" , 2nd off the float switch was so cheap the brass nipple kept spinning when we tried to connect 1/4"" copper tubing , had to go buy new float switch. 3rd off the controls broke the first time we pushed the button on unit the hole assemble pushed right into the unit. clip broke off and we had to glue it back on. Going to use for a week , maybe take the piece of junk back !!!!"|Negative
This product is great - very sturdy. It looks like it will survive multiple winters.|Positive
I live in Santa Fe NM and this portable cooler does a great job of keeping one large room really cool!|Positive
I live on the 3rd floor in a 600sqft apartment in Arizona and this product has worked wonders for the summer months. It also doubles as a fan that works much better than my floor fan.|Positive
Love the Evaporative cooler cover tie-down straps ( 2-pk ) for air-conditioning evaporator coil. I thought I would use the straps for various needs. They are strong and 17 ft. long. They seem to be very well made. I need things strapped down to a cart to move them. These are just what I need for light weight jobs. I have various ratchet straps I use to haul heavy loads from Home Depot.|Positive
Swamp cooler cover fit just right|Positive
Absolutely perfect and your fast shipping saved me money. Guy was up on roof when UPS brought it to the house. THANK YOUUUUUU I'm thrilled with how thick it is too. Very good buy for the price.|Positive
It does everything like it should, keeps me cool without big power bill.|Positive
excelent|Positive
This unit is more than I expected. It blows very cool and high is too much.|Positive
I needed a demand watering system for my pet pig who drinks a lot of water. I installed this device on his watering bowl so that it will automatically re-fill he bowl when he takes a drink.|Positive
seems to work ok|Positive
Works good, easy to get going out of the box. Hold about 10 gallons of water and goes through it quick in my climate. Rolls from one location to another easily and the cord is 9 feet long.|Positive
Was easy ensamble|Positive
There was something wrong with it. Itleaked all over my rug, so we returned it to our local Home Depot store.|Negative
Works great for our 1200 sq ft area. It was easy to set up and has been so nice during this hot summer.|Positive
"Better then exected but as labeled on carton, ""NOT an air conditioner"". Works in high temps of Arizona in emergency situations."|Positive
Worked well right out of the box. It is critical that there is an input door and an exit door, otherwise the area is a sauna. Did not leak and was easy to regulate the water flow.|Positive
Our last one rusted out in 10 years. When it was time to replace, we knew MasterCool was the best. We got it installed right before the heat came to Tucson. This new unit works much better than the old one. I do wish it came with a plastic media instead of cardboard and was already either rust-proof or stainless.|Positive
This unit had parts missing!!! This unit was a display unit and someone removed the knob the turns unit on had to go buy one from local hardware store to complete this job for our customer!!!!!!! Not the way we like to do business!!|Negative
Order unit twice and both were damaged. Decided to go somewhere else for product.|Negative
Great unit! Works as expected and hose hookup does not leak!|Positive
It worked fine. Thank you.|Positive
I bought this unit during the summer and love it. It is convenient to use and works well for my outdoor space.|Positive
Good fit. Works great|Positive
Has cooled more than 500 sq ft on the hot summer days above 90 degrees. Must fill with water every four to 5 hours. Runs great and fairly quiet.|Positive
Works as it should, as good as original that came with cooler.|Positive
Pretty much ready to, just add water or turn on for fan. Us ed it for son’s bedroom and it was cooler.|Positive
Highly recommend!!|Positive
it didn't seize up. It just didn't work. This pump is junk. I kept it in my swamp cooler for one week until failure. Get a submersible and don't bother around with this waste of time.|Negative
easy installation. works great!|Positive
I installed this unit in a wall opening and wanted to pass on a lesson learned. I installed the unit higher up on the wall and learned afterward the the lights on the front of the panel indicating what the fan speed was and pump status can not be seen. The lights are obviously designed to be seen at an elevation of a window installation, not a wall installation. So take that into consideration if you are considering a wall installation for this unit.|Positive
I have 2 of these units...... And i must say they work great ! I recently bought my second unit because when my mother was in town visiting she fell in love with it and i had no other choice then to purchase one for her. I recently placed an order with the luma company and their customer service department is the best by far ! A girl by the name of lupita assisted me when looking for a dealer and yvette did an outstanding job when answering all of my technical support questions, she didnt mind doing the research and even called me back when my parts arrived. That is what i call 100% satisfaction ! I defenitly recommend this product.|Positive
did not know had to add ice and water to get cool aie|Negative
It was very easy to set up in cooler|Positive
As we have gotten older and into retirement, it has become preferable to have our swamp coolers with a remote control. This college's c a capacity allows us to use it on low cool except on the very hottest days. We live in the desert, so the humidity. It delivers drops the static electricity shocks we get to almost none. Highly recommend this unit!|Positive
Don't know what the post about loudness meant! This unit is more quiet than our steel-bodied cooler that this one replaced. Yes, on high it is loud but only because the airflow through the grill makes a noise due to disturbance the flow pattern. This is by far the best evaporative cooler we have used. The efficiency is greater than our old unit qualifying for a premium rebate from Xcel Energy. And the installation was relatively easy only complicated by our roof slope rather than anything with the cooler itself. I highly recommend the unit. What's not to like about a unit that works better, requires less maintenance, and won't rust? I would rate it at 5 if we had the cooler longer. Don't yet know of any mechanical issues, although we do have the Home Depot extended warranty just in case.|Positive
This Evaporative Fan did not work for us at all. It simply spit out Warm Humid Air. Maybe in another climate it would work better. The two stars r for the appearance of fan.|Negative
We refill the water almost every day because it evaporates fast. Good cooling fan with timer and speed adjustment. It doesn't take much space in our room which is good. So far so good, it works well especially this summer|Positive
This is a well design water cooler and it works nicely. The only draw back is adding humidity to the room. It’s absolutely not for a closed indoor area and you have to open the windows. If it is hot and humid outside and you have to open the windows, it will be hard to cool down the room. I think it’s better to use it outdoor like having a BBQ party. I have to return the cooler and stick with my AC. By the way, it’s kind of noisy if you use it at bed time.|Positive
We have problems with this unit. Start-up is poorly, sometimes it starts immediately, other times it takes a while. So far it has been gushing water all day long, every time we use it??? Would not recommend this to anyone. Too much money for the problems it has.|Negative
love it keep the house cool 1600 sq house nice cooler|Positive
stiching came loose 4in section|Negative
This product did not appreciably cool the room and the water lasted only about six hours, making this a rather expensive fan.|Negative
This is a must have if you have the Champion swamp cooler I have. Fits perfect, blocks all air flow and will be a necessity come winter. This one is a perfect fit and for the price, a must have. It is exactly what I ordered and is exactly as described. it fit like a glove, as it should. It fits very tightly, and was a worry when I removed it for the first time, but after that it is not so worrisome. The perfect fit, and quality materials make this what you need for your Champion cooler, I found a ton that were a lot more expensive at other locations. Why pay more for the same thing? HomeDepot always does me proper on the shipping times too. I was suprised it got to me so quickly.|Positive
Keeps my room cool, but not on humid days, it will leave the room hot and muggy. Overall, better than a fan.|Positive
Very well made, installed a couple of weeks ago. Hopefully it will hold up during winter months.|Positive
"night and day difference between old pad (scaled) and new pad - installed a "" hogs hair"" pre filter and I drain Mastercool sump daily to protect new pad from scale buildup -"|Positive
Was happy it came with motor and hooks and chain to mount to wall. Actually installed this into the wall instead of window. Motor is powerful and can feel it blowing across our 1700 sq. ft. home. The only complaint we had was that it says 5000 cfm and when we took the model number and sku number to the store, it is actually a 2700 cfm model. This model with 2700 cfm is only online and it is 599. but we had to pay 615. for it. The model numbers and cfm's are not correct on this website.|Positive
Unit arrived with a few minor dents from shipping. After hauling it up on the roof and installing it I found that the blower unit had a big dent in it and had been installed in the cabinet crooked. Also, the squirrel cage was misaligned in the housing with a gap on one side large enough to put my hand in it. These problems were due to poor construction at the factory, not mishandling during shipping.|Negative
This product will work good if you're looking for a big humidifier, but as for a portable cooler not as useful. It most definitely needs to be in a very airy space not a bedroom. According to the description that's what I got. Just hoping for cooler air.|Negative
These straps are they great way to secure the winter cover on my swamp cooler.|Positive
Unit was easy to install, lightweight but does go better with two people. Puts out a lot of cold air even on low, needs adjustable louvers on front to control air flow. Unit is just like a fan, not like a a/c unit. It's all or nothing. But well worth the money.|Positive
I purchased new pillow block bearings, as my previous set finally wore out after many years of service. As far as the replacement bearings; the fitment was great and they are very easy to install. In the end, my Evaporative Cooler is fixed and I'm cool and happy. YEA!!|Positive
the cooler is wonderful. However, home depot does not carry the appropriate accessories. The roof jack required is very specific to the bonaire cooler and home depot does not carry it|Positive
I’ve had my champion for four years and it’s been a good preforming air conditioner but the only thing I’m having a problem with is rust and the remote control was always temperamental until it went out this week. Overall the cooler has a strong cabinet and with all the sides removable maintenance is very easy and has been very reliable.|Positive
I recommend this item with one rather large reservation. The hose hook up one this cooler is molded into the plastic of the unit. This is the weakness of this unit. If you buy this and go to hook it up you will understand what I'm talking about. Otherwise this is a great unit!|Positive
Love it bough it for our repair shop|Positive
its quiet and installed quickly.|Positive
The pads fit perfectly but when I started the cooler up, there was an awful smell from the pads that lasted almost a week before it finally went away. It was as if they were coated with something that mixed with the water and smelled horrible.|Positive
It is an effective cooling unit for my shop area. It allows me to work a couple of more hours each day in this very hot California summer. An economical solution for my cooling needs. Good unit.|Positive
This is the second Honeywell evaporative cooler I have bought. I first bought the 525cfm, 63pt a few years ago and loved it except the fan is so powerful that even on low it's very loud and blows things off of my end table. (I have a very small living room) So I put that one in my bedroom (where I like the fan noise) and looked for a quieter one for my living room and this one fit the bill. It is quieter, so I liked that, but for some reason even though it's not as powerful as the other one it's bigger! I was surprised at the size when I took it out of the box. The material it's made out of is quite a bit flimsier than the other one also. That being said, I'm satisfied with how it works. I really like that you can see how the pump sends the water through the top then drains down the pad. Both of the coolers I have work like that and I highly recommend getting one. It makes it much easier to see if the pump is working like it should. This one doesn't hold as much water as the other one so I have to fill it up a couple of times a day when I use it all day long. So overall I like this cooler. It blows cold air when used correctly and it works just like it should. If you have a larger room to cool, or if you need one that holds enough water to work through the night, I would get the 525cfm. But if you're like me with a smaller room or want a quieter one, then I do recommend this one. But overall I highly recommend a Honeywell over other brands. They have worked better than any other brands I have had, and I have had a lot!|Positive
Great machine. Quiet. Cools large area|Positive
Great product.|Positive
I'm so happy with this purchase,it's used in my familyroom kitchen space. It really helps keep the area a bit cooler in this northern calif heat. Better than turning on the AC. Thinking about buying another one. I add ice too. Longer cord would be nice.|Positive
I’m really pleased with the uniit I already used it indoor and outdoor it keeps everyone cool!|Positive
"First - It is a ""swamp cooler"". This means if you live in a high-humidity area it will not work as well as it does for those of us who live in drier climates. If you live in a ""swamp"" you might consider refrigerated air conditioning ... Runs about 7 to 8 hours on a full tank of water ... My only ""complaints"" 1) the way you add water is a bit awkward. You pour water in the side. It works but is awkward. 2) the controls, including the timer, work well but it would be nice to be able to set the cooler up and then set it to start after a certain time. I got this cooler because I am working nights and trying to sleep days. The high 80s and low 90s it was getting in my room were just too high. With the cooler it is generally less than 80 -usually under 75- in my room."|Positive
We had this model of cooler already for over 9 years, and we like it, so we simply ordered the same one.|Positive
Makes more noise than it actually cools doest works too good|Negative
Water pump went out. I don't know how Home Depot continue to see this brand.|Negative
This is a fine quality product and just what I was looking for to cover my air conditioner for the winter months for years to come.|Positive
This is a good unit. It fills best with a little hose and adding ice is best done by taking the filters out and adding it through the big hole in the back. With cold water, and especially with ice added it blows very comfortable air. It’ll keep a small room comfortable and it’s not too loud.|Positive
"We bought this to replace a Bon-Aire Durango that we'd had for over 6 years, and it doesn't even come close to the quality of the Bon-Aire! The plastic is very flimsy - first red flag. Now that we have it installed, the water ""Pours"" out of the drain while the pump is on. It filled an entire bucket in less than 20 minutes, at this rate my water bill will equal my car payment. Should have stuck with the Bon-Aire brand, they look the same, but there's no comparison! This is a piece of junk."|Negative
Just love it very satisfying high speed blow like windmill.|Positive
Broke with in 2 weeks...water leaking from base . Would not recommend purchasing|Negative
Works great in garage as long as it is not a humid day|Positive
"I'm going to return it to the store. I needed an 11""x 3/4"" pulley, I bought the 10"" reluctantly knowing I would have to change the belt too. Fortunately I found an 11"" from another supplier for direct replacement. I am becoming increasingly frustrated with Home Depot as many times now I am not able to find what I need to. Knowledgeable associates are few and far between and now HD has gone to complete self checkout, which is frustrating."|Negative
Easy to install - fit good not perfect but good fit|Positive
"Didn't work any better than a fan. Did not apply a ""cool"" effect. I took it back for a refund."|Negative
When we opened the package the pads fell apart leaving what looked like wood all over the place, very disappointed in the quality of the product|Negative
It was perfect, fit like a glove|Positive
This is thing cost me 300 and it shoots water everywhere...do not use in your house because you willslip and fall like my mother-in-law and 6 year old did. I wonder if it's too late to return it?|Negative
This works great in the garage, the speed is good compared to other models. And using ice in the water makes it even colder.|Positive
14 in. x 14 in. x 20 in. Heavy Duty Turbine Vent went on easily the draw stings draw tight around the housing. It has held securely thru some high el paso winter winds. I will see how long they last they appear to be well constructed.|Positive
This shaft was exactly what I required for a project of my own design. One requirement was a hollow shaft that would take an internal bushing.|Positive
It didn’t cool our room it just made it humid.|Negative
High quality. Will never use another type of float again, although I think this one may out last me.|Positive
Relatively easy to install, easy to operate, does the job very well for a small room. We have about 600 sq ft room with high ceiling and it is at capacity.|Positive
This air cooler has helped keep my living room bearable during really hot days in Northern CA. I have open beam ceiling so there's nothing to trap the heat coming in from the roof. I fill the cooler with cold water from the refrigerator, and add cube ice in top tray. It's not too loud, and the sweep function spreads the cool air around the room. If I'm sitting, I can have it just blow on me if I need to. It's made summer much more bearable.|Positive
I used it to cover a Trane compressor this winter. So far, it has withstood the cold (low 30 F) weather with gusty wind and rain. I used it to stop any cold air coming into the bedroom. I like the heavy duty material that the cover is made of and it did the job well. When I removed it two months later, it is still in excellent shape. It has met all my expectation and I highly recommend it.|Positive
Great worked and fit perfect.|Positive
Very satisfied with our purchase from Brian's Canvas Products. Good Quality & delivery was handled quickly too. Thank you again for your service. Shall use you again Brian.|Positive
"What cover plate, over the electrical box, is supposed to be used? I have a 2-gang electrical box that MUST be covered up. (It appears the manufacturer intended that no cover plate was ""needed"" to ""cover"" a 1-gang box. Tacky.) This unit's mount holes are 3.25"" apart; same as old style wall switch. The rear area of the T-stat is rectangular, like that of the large opening Decora or Decorator (depending on brand) cover plates. But these Decora plates use the 3.75"" distance mount holes; not the needed 3.25"" holes. They won't fit! On top of the mount hole problem, these Decora plate ID openings for the body of switches or outlets are 1.5"" wide & the required plate width for the T-stat is 1.75""! I could enlarge the side ID on a plate, but I can't change the mount hole location! So far, the only option I see is keep this unit & fab a cover plate or dump this T-stat for something else!?? (The in-store reps were also at a loss for an answer.) Unit may work fine but can't install with needed 2-gang cover plate to find out. Therefore I must return it."|Negative
Can help lower indoor temperatures use near open shady window to draw in cool air use in conjunction with other fans to circulate air in stuffy areas uses small amount of filtered water to help lower temperature|Positive
I ordered two of these. One leaked. But I was so happy with the other one that I reordered the second one. Kept my house about eight to ten degrees cooler than outside. When it was 87 outside, my living area would be about 78 to 80 degrees. Not too loud on lower fan speed.|Positive
really cools down the shop fast|Positive
Remote is a very cheaply built, do not drop it. have had to but it back together many times. cooler works great though. low setting keeps my house cool except on the very hottest days.|Positive
It works because it fits. Material is durable. I got eight years out of my last one.|Positive
It says that motor is not included. What it doesn't say is that the float, motor clamp, water line and ends (everything else except for the knob to turn it on) is included. It does not have the deflector that is on the front of most side draft coolers. Works great, just ask our 8 days of 100+ degree temperatures. Kept the house at a little under 80 degrees, that was a 28 degree difference on one of the days.|Positive
This product works great. Unplugging the AC Has never been easier. I recommend anyone who has a few swamp coolers to get this snake.|Positive
It was extremely noisy, and didn’t seem to cool my small bedroom down. However, it gets cold, but the air has to blow directly on you at 5 ft away! So this is why I have it a score of three and the reason i am returning it to he store today! :(|Negative
Product was easy to order and came to my home. Very easy to install.|Positive
Straps seem to work ok. They haven’t been in place long enough to make a final determination.|Negative
It was quiet. That's the 1 star.|Negative
works great. Even better when you and ice to the water.|Positive
Does the trick. A little on the big side but we'll live with it.|Positive
there is nothing wrong with this cooler! I bought this unit for when I sit or work in the garage and place it about 8 or 10 feet from me and it keeps me nice and cool on speed 2. The electronics are set up to easily control and it comes with a remote. This is NOT an air conditioner, its an evaporative cooler that uses WATER to drip over the air intake. If the humidity is up , well these types of coolers don't work as well. But let me tell you it makes being in the garage ALOT more comfortable than without it and I don't usually ever use the high speed. I ordered it on Sunday afternoon and it was at my house Tuesday around 1 pm ! The only negative I can say is the water plug on the back of the unit is just a rubber plug and I bumped it moving it around and water leaked, it should be a screw plug|Positive
Had it since Tues.(7/10) and the remote control does not work now. Will have to call to get either a new remote or a whole new unit.|Negative
Delivered 8/24, pump stopped working 9/7. Used less than 9 days. Unbelievable. I guess the good part is that when it was working properly, it did make a big difference and made the hot, humid Texas heat bearable. Not sure what to do now. Return it or ask for a new pump. I hope other units are more reliable.|Negative
I have a large west facing back porch. I brought a port a cool 3000 due to the small direct air flow, it had very little impact on the heat. I purchased the 5300 CFM next. Due to the large airflow, it works much better. It is actually quieter than the port a cool unit.|Positive
It’s practically a mini swamp cooler in every aspect but the name. It doesn’t really cool the room down, but I really only use it when I’m trying to go to bed. Easy controls and buttons to use, filling with water can be a little hassle, I’m using a watering can to fill it up.|Positive
Worked great - as expected. no problems at all.|Positive
This Chinese designed and made evaporative cooler is like the most powerful thing in the universe! It's basically a water fountain(yes!) + media + fan, and uses 190watts at low setting. 250 watts at high. It is HUGE, you'll need some distance between it and you, otherwise it'd be too cold! Only con is this thing (different brand) in China is sold for around $100... so a 3X price increase in America...|Positive
works great and no oiling|Positive
The item is good. Thank you!|Positive
Yes!!!!|Positive
Unfortunately it did not meet my needs it's more of a fan then a cooler|Negative
It fit beautifully, and looks great. Now we'll see how it stands up against the winter.|Positive
This Frigidaire Evaporative Air Cooler and Tower Fan is amazing. I did not expect to love it as much as I do but this is an excellent product. It has four different strengths as well as a feature where the air oscillates and a feature where it imitates nature by using fluctuating strengths as if the wind was picking up and slowing down. It can be very light or quite powerful. It is very effective with cooling the room down as well. It is surprisingly powerful. It even has a remote so you don't have to get up to change the setting or to turn it on or off. Now I want one of these in every room in my home! I highly recommend this product.|Positive
They were an inch short of the width of the mastercool unit were I live|Negative
Was easy to use. Cooled well. Quite a relied on a hot night.|Positive
This cooler works great in small spaces. It is very cost efficient to run. It did not raise my electric cost any. Keep you cool all day or about 6 hours with the ice option|Positive
Operates as advertised. I run it at night in my bedroom. Does not seem to cool down the air temp that much but does keep room from being too draw. Only drawback I have is I need to fill it every other day and that can be a sloppy non-trivial task. Wish it had a hose to go from sink to reservoir. May have to buy something additional to ease this.|Positive
"Perfect Application FOR US. NOTE DETAILS HOWEVER - We ordered this for our Central Washington State cabin because it gets to 100 degrees there and even with our solar shaded house, the house was too hot to entertain guests.The key to this system is low local outdoor humidity. Performance is directly related to your local humidity. At our cabin the hot days result in relative humidity of about 12%, as reported on our weather station. This means that although the dry air is hot, it will cool dramatically (losing 22 degrees F in our case) when the incoming air is ""wetted"" through the cooler passageways. Scientifically, I measured a 63 F ""wet bulb"" on a 90 F day. The cooler took the incoming air down to 68F which is a 5 degree approach to wet bulb (which is pretty darn good!) Wet bulb is like ""dew-point"" so you could estimate your performance that way. The air then warms a bit inside your space so its not ""muggy"". Very Nice and the humidity helps your dry cracked skin! Negatives: there are a few parts that are not included such as a special ""sill valve"" ( I used a 2-way off our hose bib then a hose adapter to 1/4 thread, then a needle valve to compression fitting). You will also want to buy some 1/4"" poly tubing to run from your needle valve to the reservoir input on the side (they only provide a bare 1/4"" compression fitting. The instructions say its 240 volts but that is not true - its modified for USA 120V service. It also is designed to leak about 1 gallon per hour to keep the solids from building up in the reservoir (pure water is being evaporated leaving all the crusty hardness in the reservoir, even though it fills automatically.) You'll need to supply some 1/2-5/8 inch poly drain tube to slips over the overflow nozzle so you can direct it to your garden. There is not a drain on the pump reservoir so if you are going out of town it might get extra crusty if you don't drain it. Fan is big and so noise is noticeable. Other Points: You'll likely need a 2x4 length as a spacer for your window sill to secure its bottom to your siding. You'll need a good level to be sure your unit is level because it works by overflowing so if its tilted it goes only to one side. Finally the window opening has to be big enough - mine was a close fit. You'll have to ""route"" the cool air through your house by opening windows where you want the cool air to push the hot air out. A full size window is the minimum opening for venting. Summary - it works great for our 1200 sf 2 story in low humidity, once I addressed the Aussie instructions, mate!. Will pay for itself in hand cream! Way cheaper than A/C and no Freon!"|Positive
Like others said, they have a bad odor for several days. I haven't run mine all day yet - just a few hours here and there over five days. The smell is just starting to go away. The price was right to put up with the smell. I've seen these pads for sale for a LOT more money.|Positive
Used the float to put a filtered water line to a coffee machine. This was to replace the water cooler style jugs. Item works great, wanted a float small enough to fit in the internal tank. All basic hardware is included.|Positive
Excellent quality and price. Easy to install. Should last several years.|Positive
We have a mobile home in the desert of Lake Powell and it is hot. We also have a roof mounted metal swamp cooler but during the heat of the summer, the roof top unit was not cutting it. we have a window facing the east that we thought we would try this one and boy are we satisfied. I have thought that if the roof unit goes down, we will just install another one of these. Great pump and water flow, lots of air circulation and cools great. Don't get a metal one, get one of these, you wont be disappointed|Positive
it is what it is.|Negative
This swamp cooler works amazingly well. Easy to move to where you need it and easy to fill. I love that it can be used in and out side. Perfect for drier climates. I use it in the main room of my home, which has a very open floor plan. It us able to cool the entire area with no trouble in short time. My normal a.c. unit cannot cool my house but with this I will not need the a.c. except for backup on 100°+ days.|Positive
This did not fit correctly. Too small.|Negative
Far easier to install than I expected. Works great. Only negative was the initial odor from the new pads. Added 3 cups vinegar to the water and after 5 days the bad order was gone.|Positive
It's not an conditioner. But even in humid north Texas, it will give you relief from the heat. Nice addition to the patio.|Positive
My Mastercool is like new again, shipping was on time.|Positive
Easy to install. The temp out side was 98f. Inside 82f. With old filter which was 7 years old. With the new installed, 69f.|Positive
It's a great product except the swing button doesn't oscillate the air.|Positive
Very easy to install with recommended to anybody that I need to look from cooler cover|Positive
Great product. Velcro connection really helped. Prior cover was laceup and was much more difficult. Product fit fine.|Positive
If it weren't for the noise factor (I doubt anyone could sleep with this thing going... I can barely get work done when it's on), this would be a much better product.|Negative
is good|Positive
It cools, but doesnt cool 600 sq ft very well.|Negative
Built this in to a repair of a sunroom at the back of the house. One thing few share is that it pumps moist air, which is a real relief in the desert. Ran 1/4 inch water line through wall to unit, not hard at all to do. Would use 1/2 inch copper if had it to do over again. Do get a flaring tool for the copper pressure connections, no leaking problems when cinched tight. Soldered connections are the best way to go. Kit costs about $20 bucks. Replace float valve with a bronze unit for longest life. This has run for 6 years so far. Just cleaned out material that got into the spider that distributes water to all cooling pads. Use wood pads instead of plastic for best cooling results. You get an extra 5-6 degrees of cooling. Change them about half way through the season to keep fresh smell. Do spray black sealant in pan and on inside of panels to reduce scale build up. You can buy a scale filter, but it becomes a nuisance to replace. Oil the bearings on the fan at least once per season, I use garage door lubricant because it seems to hold up better. I will spray the bottom of the fan housing next season with sealant to eliminate rust and scale. Cost to replace side panels is about $55 per panel, so prevention is worth a couple of spray cans. We no longer use our AC for cooling because on high, this unit is more than adequate up to 110 degrees. Be sure to seal the air output opening completely to keep rain from seeping in. Spent a lot of time sealing this one and it has not leaked. We keep a blast screen in front of the vent (a table with long drop side) to keep it from blowing us out of the room where its located. We expect to get another 2-5 of years use from this machine. Buy a spare motor to keep on hand because you won't find them during the Winter. And spend the money for a pump that changes out the water every 8 hours. We have a hose going to one of our large, thirsty trees so it gets extra water during the hot summer. Hint: The pumps sit in perforated plastic trays. Put two nested trays under each pump to minimize debris getting into the spider distribution system. We are installing wall and ceiling vents so that cool air goes into the attic. We understand that the cool air extends roof life and further cools the house. Would like to vent into the garage for a bit of cooling as well, but not willing to compromise the fire wall. It is really nice to buy a product that far exceeds your expectations!|Positive
This cooler works very well. I'm very pleased with the price and quality.|Positive
We have been using this fan for a little over three weeks now at my place of employment, and we have all been quite pleased with its performance. There have been no mechanical issues whatsoever, and the unit is very simple to use, even with the nifty cooler/humidifier feature. To get started, you remove the plastic tray from the back of the fan, and pump in water up to the fill line. Once you've replaced the tank, simply turn the fan on and select the cooler/humidifier option. There are clearly marked buttons on the unit itself, but a corresponding remote is included. The fan also includes a couple of small ice packs that can be added to either side of the water tank once they're frozen, and these make the humidified air noticeably colder. I will say that the difference between the normal fan function and the humidified function is perhaps less drastic than one might desire, but once you've placed the ice packs in the tank, the air grows significantly cooler and the advantage of the humidifier system becomes clear. The fan features three speed settings, and the highest provides a satisfying blast of air that should be more than enough for anyone (if there were a higher setting, we'd have papers blowing everywhere). However, be sure to read the instruction manual thoroughly, as the fan has some quirky functions that might seem like faults at first glance. For instance, if you have the fan set at the highest speed then turn on the humidifier, the fan will automatically revert to medium speed. This was initially disappointing until I realized that the fan reverts to medium in order to allow the cooling pad to absorb the additional water necessary to ensure that the fan provides optimized cooling at high speeds. Thus, the fan can run the humidifier on high, as long as you give it about five minutes to adjust itself. In addition, we have all been quite impressed with how well the fan seems to work given the constraints imposed by the space we're in; we work i|Positive
Works as expected.|Positive
Was doing some carpentry work outside in 100 degree heat and this kept me cool enough to stay out all day.|Positive
We use this cooler outside to cool our west-facing patio, so we can use it during the Summer. So far, it's performed very well. At a 10-15 foot distance on a hot day, it cools the air to a comfortable level, even on low fan speed. Pros: - High cooling capacity, even outdoors - Fan is quiet on low speed - No need to keep hose connected due to sizable water reservior (lasts for hours) Cons: - No timer feature on this model (would be useful for 30-minute dry-out requirement) - Some odor from filter media during break-in (not too bad when used outdoors)|Positive
The covers were easy to put on and helped to keep my house warmer so far this winter.|Positive
First one only lasted 5 days blue top. Going into week two with this one.|Negative
Well designed humidifier, works efficiently, quiet in operation. Ordered on line and delivered within the promised schedule.|Positive
This pulley was just what I needed|Positive
I did not install, I had unit installed by handy man for an investment property|Negative
Works great, not very noisy and the price was good.|Positive
The portability of this cooler is great, product comes with casters and I have to ability to use indoor/outdoor. The downside to this unit is constantly having to fill up when you using indoors, however the unit does have an attachment for a water hose. Overall the unit works great keeps my house cool and I hope to use this unit until about June before the really hot and humid summer hits Arizona.|Positive
The pads are of good quality and last 3 to 5 years using a water inline filter.|Positive
The switch worked good|Positive
The VERY BEST you can expect from your swamp cooler with low humidity (10%) is a 30 degree reduction in the air it blows into your home. So if it is 115 outside, 10% humidity you get air blowing inside at about 85 degrees.. Also you get colder air on the SLOW speed, though not a lot of air... less cooling on high speed with more air being blown into the house. See below for a Swamp Cooler Air output chart: http://phlsystems.com/pages/cooleroutput.htm The nice thing about the Mastercool (I bought the ADA51) is that they come completely apart with a bunch of screws and 4 bolts (larger units may have more bolts). I replaced my old rusted Adobe swamp cooler 2 months ago - basically the old Adobe and Mastercool units are exactly the same - though the Mastercool has various improvements - no metal tab folds on the squirrel cage, no welding points, and of course a completely new plastic wet section inside the metal box and a metal bracket to hold the water pump. This will eliminate almost all rusting, which is great. But there is not a real design improvement here, so you will NOT get a better cooling ratio than with the really old same style units. Replace your units when they rust out, not before. You do NOT gain anything with the new units. Since I would be doing all the work myself, having the unit come completely apart made getting it on the roof easy.... though the squirrel fan weighs 37 pounds and is a bit awkward to climb up a ladder with, as it's some what large. It took me about 2 hours to put the pieces back together and ready to run.... easy since I was replacing a rusted out unit, so all power and water was ready to go with few changes. Always work Safe and Carefully !!! I did try and use a new Dial motor - but returned it as it ran excessively hot and made a loud hum throughout the house through the ducting. Once I put in the OLD motor there was no motor noise and the motor ran nice and cool. Tips: Mount the Wet section side panels to the wet bottom plate before mounting to the dry section - this makes installing it easier.... do frequent level checks - you want the unit to be as level as possible for best operation.... so check sideways and back and forth. I also put extra pieces of shingles under each of the Leg's feet.... - adjust the float (you bend the shaft) so the water is WELL BELOW the overflow - as there is run-off from the media when you turn the unit off.... Also the water feed needs to be set a bit HIGH so there is no chance of evaporation on a very hot day lowering your water tank level and possibly giving you poor dripage over your evaporation media or dry areas. AND important - as was the case with the Adobe unit, the front grill will fall out once you lift off the Wet Section's top.... so be careful here - the grill will bend if it falls out, which it always wants to do!!! I live in Palm Desert, California, and already this year we have had days of 120 degree temperatures.... where the Swamp Cooler is basically worthless.... you have to use the AC. But for temperatures under about 113 with low humidity, the Swamp Coolers works fine for me.|Positive
Not too cold|Negative
I got the cheaper version because we only have a 900 square feet house. It was still a risk, however, to get the 4500 CFM cooler (as opposed to the 5900 one) because of the location. We have it located in the worst location in the house. It's the best location in terms of convenience, the worst in terms of air flow. The air gets blown southward, has to drift east a little, then get sucked northward by an open window. However, it has been working so far. Now, we haven't had any 100-degree days yet, so the verdict is still out. I'll write another review in the middle of July. I only gave it four stars because of the manual. Hey Bongo, consider hiring an editor. This is one of the worst-written manuals I've ever read. The detail is horrible too. People want to know step by step what to do. As we went along,we figured everything out, though.|Positive
I'm certain they will work out fine. I won't need to use them until October and it is only July now.|Positive
Har to fill with a sink spray other than that works perfectly|Positive
Not very durable for the price. Seems to cool on our patio very well despite the cosmetics .|Negative
These are made of a ripstop material, probably not as good as the first I bought, made of canvas and lasted 12-15 years. Initial quality looks much improved over the second set I bought (only got about 4-5 years usage). They fit perfectly over my turbines with the external support frame.|Positive
I had to replace my old pump and went up one size larger. My cooler works a lot better now.|Positive
bag fit well over turbine but velcro straps would have been better than the cheap draw strings used to secure the bag|Positive
I replaced a 40 year old swamp cooler of similar design purchased from Sears. We originally had Sears install air conditioning in our Denver home but it proved to be innefective in cooling the house and in 1977 the air conditioning increased our electric costs by $80/month. So Sears replaced the air conditioner with a window swamp cooler at a cost $250 in 1977. So now we have a Brisa that cost about $500 in 2018 and our electric utility company sent us a $200 rebate so the net cost was about $300. The Brisa cools our 1500 square foot house extremely well and I went with the model that uses aspen pads instead of the synthetic pads because they are very efficient and cost far less to replace.|Positive
Worked well, no complaints. I replaced a motor that had begun to make a troublesome noice. FYI you probably need to purchase a replacement pulley as well.|Positive
Item arrived earlier than expected which helped me get the job done quicker|Positive
Looks like it fits well and is attractive looking but it is still summer and I haven’t snapped it on yet. Will have to wait till winter time to fully try it out.|Positive
OK, so it's only been in operation a few days, so I can't comment on longevity or performance over the long run. However, my swamp cooler is 23 yrs old and this unit fit easily on the support bracket, was easy to wire with the cord from the old motor, and ran perfectly. The old pulley also fit perfectly. 30 min tops to put the pulley on and the cord then install. My old motor was whisper quite and this one seems to be equally so. It was also 107 on the day my old motor died and once replaced with this unit, my cooler ran on high for 2 straight days. As with the old motor, my cooler sufficiently cools my entire 2500 sq ft home. I love my cooler and don't relish the idea of having to buy a new one, as they're not as easy to get into now and don't run as quiet. So getting a few more years with this little motor would be terrific. For what it's worth given the limited usage so far, it's a 5-star for the price in my book.|Positive
I've purchased this same cooler cover from Home Depot before. It lasted well, reasonably priced and I loved it.....still do!|Positive
I don't usually take the time to review products. But perhaps by sharing, I can save someone else from a bad purchase experience. This is the second Ultracool brand evaporative cooler I have purchased. Both purchases have been a huge disappointment. I purchased a different, less expensive Ultracool model two years ago. It worked fine, then broke down (just after 1 year and having used it for only 4 months of that year). I replaced the other unit with this particular Ultracool cooler, thinking my first unit was just an inexpensive model. I liked many of the features of this unit, and it worked incredibly well for the first 3-4 months. But just like the first Ultracool unit I bought, it had problems...again, immediately after the 1 year warranty had expired (hmmm......???). This unit is incredibly difficult to get the back side off (to assemble, to clean, to check pump...etc.). The wabbly caster design makes it cumbersome to move the unit around when the water level is full. The cheap little water level floater was the first thing to fail on both of my Ultracool units. A minor thing - it doesn't prohibit the units from working, but you have to manually check the water level when you fill them. The failure on this particular unit was electronic: in the circuit board (the censor for the water level stopped working, and as a result the pump will no longer work). Not an easy fix (even for A/C repair guys who looked at it), and not covered by warranty, so again I have having to purchase a new air conditioner. Considering I used both of my Ultracool units for only the summer season (3-4) months, and was diligent in cleaning the units every month (water deposits will clog these units), my Ultracool ac's were only good for a total of 3-4 months of use before they failed! In between that, I had periodic problems with the pumps and hoses, which friends in the AC industry were thankfully able to fix for me. My loss with Ultracool has been +$500 for the two (now dead) units I bought. Take the time to compare Ultracool's warranty to other brands. I do not recommend this brand at all. My review in a nutshell: stay away from Ultracool.|Negative
"This cover fit my Master Cool unit well - easy to slip on, and dimensions were true so that it fit closely and should keep out the wind, rain, and snow. I would call the canvas material ""medium weight"", not extremely heavy-duty, but heavier than some I have seen. Drawstring around the bottom of the cover is a minimal means of tying it on, so I used a strap around the lower half to secure it. Canvas is treated to increase weather resistance and should repel any moisture. Only time will tell how long this cover holds up to the sun and weather, but I anticipate decent performance and would buy another one if it lasts as expected."|Positive
The unit was already to use right out of the box. It is lightweight and easy to move from different locations. Filling the tank is a simple. the use of ice in the upper compartment helps with cooling down the area.|Positive
This really works, I had to put an extra blanket on to keep warm. We will use this all summer while leaving the AC off to save money. I worry about the plug, seems to leak a little. I'm looking online to see if they have parts, so far I'm not seeing anything.|Positive
i bought one it lasted 1 week before the water pump went out. Took it back the second one lasted 2 weeks before the water pump also went out. Not a good product.|Negative
We haven't had this for a full season yet, but so far it's holding up very well & hopefully will for years to come! :)|Positive
Just what I needed.|Positive
Not good. Going to return it when I have the time1. ??????????????????|Negative
Running near constantly for two weeks so far - so good. Pros: Works well. Quieter and smaller than expected. Hose connection with float valve. Large honeycomb pad, well saturated. Buck fifty. Cons: Louvers are a little flimsy. Lack of any oscillation feature. Just under 5 gallon capacity. Manual fill door is difficult to open/close. Single switch for all modes with graphics to choose mode We have a large, 1540 CFM portable cooler (name rhymes with Honeysmell) that has several features, but costs close to $400. This is an excellent no frills cooler that blows a considerable amount of air for the price.|Positive
The turbine covers met my expectations!!|Positive
Well, I got this product almost 2 months ago. Its effect on electricity bill is really minimal. However, it is a very weak cooler. I had red people's reviews on it before my purchase. Some told it makes the air 10 degrees cooler. Well, it might bring 75 degree to 70 but never makes 85 to 84. In fact for weather more than 83 just forget it. Especially for pretty humid weather of Los Angeles it just adds to the humidity. Also, when it indicates that the space must be less than 25 sq f it is really true. It won't make bigger spaces cool. You need to stay in an optimal distance. If you are very close the wind will be annoying and if you stay far or not in front of it you will not feel any cooler. Its diameter is also not big enough to circulate the air. But I think it is good during the night. It does not make any annoying noise. I like the timer and other setting options . All in all i think by spending a little bit more money i could do way better.|Negative
Excellent!!!|Positive
I've had this cooler for a few weeks now and so far, so good. This one works better than any other one I've had in the past. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the noise. The fan on it is very loud, but I know that's just because it blows so hard. I'm sure I won't mind the noise when it's 110 degrees here in Phoenix! I'll just be happy it DOES blow so hard! I really like the design of it too. Easy to use and maintain. I'm even thinking of getting another one for my bedroom.|Positive
Good product. The universal fit made it difficult to fit in the cooler.|Positive
Finally used the MC37M...nice product! The unit rolls around with and without water just fine. The power cord is long and heavy duty. The louvers, manual up/down and oscillating side-to-side are also nice. The cooler holds lots of water, is not terribly noisy, and worked fine the first time. The three speeds are nice with Low in use most of the time for us. The vertical louvers are a little 'wavy', like they got hot. But all the louvers still oscillate fine. And, I saw little yellow flakes in the water drained from the reservoir. So, I would recommend rinsing out the water reservoir before first use. I have not used the water hose connection, nor have I had to change the pads. We have only used filtered water (in-line filter on garden hose). This seems to work well, no mineral deposits yet. I like this cooler very much. With proper care, it should serve me well for some time.|Positive
Replacing the filter is easy. The old filter was calcified and heavy.|Positive
Though it says on the Home Depot text that it cools 500 square feet, the product info in the box says 500 cubic feet, which is much less space. In my house which has 7 foot ceilings, this will really only cool 71 square feet. When the pump was running, the sound of the water was really loud. The electronic panel worked only about 1/2 the time. I had to unplug and replug repeatedly to get it to work. The drain plug stripped out and couldn't be unscrewed. The float doesn't move correctly, so you have to use a flashlight to be sure you're not overfilling it.|Negative
Belt fits & works fine.|Positive
Excellent, I love it.|Positive
We have a mountain cabin at 6,200 feet elevation in Southern California. Nine months out of the year we don't need any cooling, so we didn't want to invest in central air. Because our humidity is typically very low, we knew evaporative cooling would be the cheapest and most efficient. So, after looking at our many choices we chose this model because of the electronic timer and humidifier function. It is working wonderfully for us. According to the thermometer placed at the exhaust point the output air temperature is 68° and that is fantastic for us. It's 84° outside and yet sitting in the breeze from this unit we feel very cool and comfortable.|Positive
Plugged it in, Works Great! We have no cooling system and this gets us by for awhile until we can save up to put one in!|Positive
works good,just speed up shipin|Positive
Didn’t really feel too much of a difference between water pump running and not running. I had to clean the filter every 2 days otherwise the air would smell like wet dog. I returned this item and do not recommend it.|Negative
Put the wheels on it, fill with water and it's ready to go. I am using it in a 240 sq, ft. wood working shop with, sometimes, multiple 3 - 5 hp motors running. The normal outside temperatures here, this time of year, average about 98 to 105 degrees F. I wouldn't say it keeps the shop really cool but it makes it tolerable for me to work in it. It is replacing a 15,000 btu AC and does just as good a job without the high electric costs. I am happy with it.,|Positive
Shipped quickly and the delivery person helped move it to where I needed. Kind of disappointed in the build quality of the unit, as in cheaply made, but that is no fault of Home Depot. The vanes flex instead of changing direction when you try to adjust them. I thought it was a complete kit, but you will have to buy the spigot and line to connect it to your water supply. Once hooked up and running, the unit works very well after you've figured out how to balance the flow by opening a window. This unit replaced a similar Adobe brand cooler that lasted 25 years. We'll see about this one. All in all happy with my purchase.|Positive
Perfect.|Positive
These turbine covers seem durable and were very easy to install. We installed 2 in 15 minutes. I'm sure they will be as easy to uninstall.|Positive
This 4500cfm (at single inlet pressure) does a consistently better job than my previous cooler. While it can only bring 95 degree air down to 65, that's all I need. I've now had the same unit on my daughter's 900 sf house for 2.5 years, son's 1500 sf house 1 year and mine (1600sf up, walkout basement down) now for 1 month. All of them seem to be working fine, but you do need to have a clamp on amp meter to check the current draw (at breaker box), my son's burned up a motor in about one year, when I checked it with the same Dial motor I found it needed a different pulley (sheave) to be adjusted into the right amp range.|Positive
Cools the room well. A bit noisy, would be impossible to sleep with.|Positive
This cooler is amazing and it was easy to get going. I am very pleased with how much water it holds, and how it cools. It definitely keeps my house cool on those hot summer days.|Positive
I only recommend it for a very very small room...does not cool it is more of a fan than anything.|Negative
Very easy to install an hook up. Was 103 degrees outside, my shop was 108 degrees inside. After I hooked it all up, I let it run for 3 hours. Went an checked temp inside my shop an it was already down to 86 degrees. My shop is a 30x30|Positive
Works best when pointed at you. I do recommend using cold water. Its needs to be used for those dry heat days. Will not work very well on a humid days|Positive
"Upon removing the unit from its box, I found no casters. So I went back to the store where I picked it up, an inconvenience, to hopefully get a set from another unit. But Hessaires are online special order only. And the sales staff didn't know how to get any other than contacting the mfr. I did, but haven't heard back. Turns out they are shipped IN the unit and you have to know that because there is nothing to tell you. No tags or notes in the manual, nothing. Luckily a vague memory told me to take off the back panel, (this is my second unit) and wedged tightly inside, was a box with the casters. But there's more - one set of four screw holes on the unit to which you attach the casters was not threaded, so the screws wouldn't go in. I managed a work-around, but it required extra hands. Now to attach the hose adapter and hose. The supplied hose adapter leaks, badly. To the hardware store for another (at my cost) :-( That's better, but the attachment on the unit still leaks some. Hose is attached, and water turned on, and the unit fills. But the filler float doesn't stop the water when the limit is reached and water starts spewing out of the sides. I'm hot, and I'm mad, and I'm concerned that I won't be able to use this to keep my rabbits cool enough in the impending heat. Then I think about the smaller Hessaire unit that I have that works well - I used a 1/2"" hose with it, not a standard 5/8"" Luckily I have one. So I switched out hoses and held my breath. Yay! Float works, no water spewing out the sides, the leak from the hose attachment isn't terrible and the unit cools. (Btw, NONE of this info of using a smaller hose is mentioned in the manual.) Oh, but what's that noise? On high the fan must rub on something but we can't tell what. This unit is going back once I get a replacement. But now they are out-of-stock for online orders!! Hessaire, I'm not happy!!"|Negative
This cooler it's the job done :)|Positive
easy to assemble. cool great. just what I needed for the shop|Positive
Great product , I had to replace my Brisa 4000 CFM after 15 years of service after loosing a winding on the motor and just heavy usage over the years . Bought the CFM 5000 , combined that with a rebate from our power company , became fairly inexpensive compared to an AC system .|Positive
I enjoy the wheel feature so I can move it from my office to the bedroom depending on the day. I also don't have to run the AC all day to cool the entire house if I'm in my office all day at home. I can hear the water trickle as it circulates which isn't a big deal, sounds like an aquarium, that's all but I wanted to mention it. I like the timer ability and the cooling ice packs that were included (2) so it can cool more effectively on the 120 degree days!|Positive
Does not work as an evaporative cooler. This works as a fan and when the air conditioning is on it blows the cold air from the air conditioning but if there is warm air and I live dead smack in the desert where nobody waters of their lawn. It is very dry and this does not cool the air. I'm going to have to say it's really poorly made as well. .

great price, easy to set up, fast delivery|Positive
It was working very well thrown in the air very cold I loved it I know that it is not an air conditioner but thrown to the air very cold when I put the ice in the one in the water tank But the problem that I had with him is that it began to liquidate and I did not know where the water came from And|Positive
This evaporative cooler is every bit as good as an air conditioner in our home, and much easier on the electric bill than a air conditioner. As long as there is an air intake (near a window, or door) and an air outflow to the outside ( a window left partially open) the humidity level will remain low. It does not work well to completely close up the room. The only problem with this cooler is that my family makes me turn it off because they are too cold, even though it is perfect for me. It is quiet, efficient, the slim design works well, and I would recommend this cooler very highly.|Positive
horrible. leaks. not cool very much (my 40$ evaporative works better), horrible customer service. HOME DEPOT should stop carrying this brand based on the customer service alone.|Negative
I purchased this for our chicken coop. It is a 300 sq ft coop that is not insulated and has a metal roof. The coop turns into an oven in summer and we have tried so many things to cool it down (fans, shades, spraying it down, and even a window AC unit) but it has been an uphill battle. Finally found something powerful enough to cool down the coop! The cooler is bigger than I pictured, but fits great in the doorway. We use an exhaust fan on the other end to keep air moving through to keep inside humidity down. Today was 100 degrees and I was able to keep the coop at 74 all day! Normally the coop runs MUCH hotter than the outside temp....so we were essentially able to get a 115 degree outbuilding in full sun, down to 74 degrees! We consider this a great win!|Positive
I like the free shipping and the product was just what I ordered.|Positive
They are great and I will be purchasing more soon Thank you|Positive
"It blows ""luke warm"" air. There is no water gauge so you have to get down on your hands and knees with a flashlight and shake the unit to see the water level - silly and very inconvenient! Rollers don't roll well on carpeting."|Negative
Good, basic product.|Positive
I chose this product because I needed a reduction in temp while retaining humidity & hopefully increasing it. In 55 sq ft space, I needed a small unit & didn't want to pay more than $100 for that small space. The temp reduced by about 5 degrees while humidity increased about 5%. I was hoping for double that which is why I almost returned it. However, they make no claim this product will meet my expectations. Based on it's features, I was hoping. The fact that this fan has a reservoir for ice, the ion filter and some of the control features made all the difference for me. Also reasons I purchased this unit and ended up being the tip of the scale. Works perfectly, super easy, light weight and I will definitely use in other rooms. Totally worth it.|Positive
Very happy with our purchase of the Master Cool. Hard to believe a Swamp Cooler has a Thermostat but it sure does and it makes life a whole lot easier. The best part is the media which is easy to install and the water supply doesn't flood the entire floor of the unit. J|Positive
My wife and I enjoy sitting on the porch in the mornings and evenings, however we live in South Texas and the heat is pretty rough. This little cooler really helps. It drops the temp.enough to make it comfortable.|Positive
I tried this product twice. Once with cold water and another with water with a ton of ice. After running it for 4-5 hours, the room was still hot and more humid than when I started the device. I ended up returning it.|Negative
I live in Las Vegas and bought this to use in my 3 car garage. During the summer the rooms above and next to my garage get very warm. I thought if I could keep the garage temperature lower than it would help keep my house cooler. The heat is on here and I'm very happy with how well this is working. Today is 108 and my garage is currently 89. My garage usually would be about 102. This works really well in a dry climate. I wish I would've purchased something like this years ago.|Positive
We have used this air conditioner for only a few days. It has been quiet compared with the last one and does keep the house cool and pleasant.It is a better looking unit than most, and we are very pleased with it.|Positive
This product came exactly as described. It was a very nice fit, made out of very tough weather proof canvas that I expect will last several winters with snow and ice.|Positive
Wonderful|Positive
Quiet and cool.|Positive
This garage cooler, or for your patio, sunroom..... It is NOT a air conditioner by any means, so don't expect it to be, but it does remove the heat from the garage. Think of it as a fan on steroids. When I first filled it with ice and water and turned it on, it almost blew me away, and that was on LOW. So I gave it a few minutes and it started to cool. Now like I said, it does not bring the temp to 65 degrees, but for a fan in the garage while I am polishing my car, or working with my tools, or if I wanted to just ponder, it takes the heat out. So even though I cannot give this a 5 star because it is louder than I would like, it does work.|Positive
"I bought this cooler out of my own pocket for the service garage I work at. I've had this little unit for about a month now. To preface this review, having an evaporative cooler is not the same as having actual air conditioning. I think a lot of negative reviews come from people not familiar with evaporative coolers. This cooler is a lot nicer than having just a fan on the desk. It's fairly quiet on low speed and it feels like a cool breeze blowing across the room. On extremely humid days it definitely doesn't work as effectively but it still helps take the edge off of our ""hot"" 90 degree days here in Flagstaff, AZ. To start off with the negative aspects of this product, I believe that the mode selector switch feels very cheap. Some people might also not care for the plastic construction as well but for the price point this doesn't really bother me. This is a portable unit so the tank does have to be refilled from time to time. Like most evaporative coolers the pads can develop a bit of an odor if you don't keep after them. It also bugs me that it doesn't automatically shut the pump off when the water tank runs dry. Besides the cheap mode selector switch and the other inherent downsides of using an evaporative cooler I have found this unit to be an incredible value. The fan moves a good amount of air and unlike some reviews, I have found that I consistently get 3-5 hours on a tank of water depending on how humid and whether I'm the fan on low or high. Overall this cooler represents a great value and I'm probably going to by another couple for around the shop!"|Positive
Have these in all my upstairs bedrooms and they work great. No more having to open and close windows.|Positive
Don't expect this cooler to cool the room. For best results you need to add a lot of ice and place it really close to you. A good fan is nearly as good.|Negative
It did not fit my plug type. Returned|Negative
588 CFM 3-Speed Portable Evaporative Air Cooler for 342 sq. ft. Brilliant. I live in an area where the summer is hot (over 100 F) and very dry. This is the perfect item for keeping cool outside when I am having those neighborhood barbecues. Everyone loves it. I just put up a canopy and then turn on the cooler and the area under the Canopy becomes a pleasant temperature. This item is also great for when I am working in the garage or shed. Its on wheels so it is easy to move from one location to the other. It has a water tank so if you don’t have immediate access to a hose then fill it up and its completely portable as long as you have an extension cord. Or if you have a hose, it has a place for the hose to plug in. I has an amazing fan. It really moves a lot of air. The great thing is if the air conditioner ever goes out on the house I will have a back up to cool a room down with. In July and August that is important. It has a remote for easy operation. It has three fan speeds as shown in the video. It has fan mode and cool mode. It has a timer for how long you want it to run. It has a swing mode that moves the vents up and down so the air isn’t always in one direction. The coolest part is that when I turn it off the vents close so the inside doesn’t get filled with bugs and dirt when its sitting around. I really like this product.|Positive
It sucks barely throws out any cold air unless you keep adding ice|Negative
This unit works as advertised. I purchased this unit for a 600 square foot apartment knowing I could've gotten by with a smaller unit. I'm very happy with the unit and now I'm comfortable even on 90 degree plus days. It comes with a remote control which was a surprise. The remote control is ideal for my situation.|Positive
Nice compact size and quick to set up and use, but the output leaves much to be desired.|Negative
Keeps the house to a bearable temp.|Positive
You have to be sitting right in front of it to feel the cooler air. Doesn't cool down the room. Always have to put ice in it for it to blow cool air, otherwise, it's no better than a fan.|Negative
Works. Expected more but it does cool the room down a bit.|Positive
Good looking product, but we haven't installed it yet; hope to get it done in the next week.|Positive
Set up, plugged in and it didn't even start. Had to return.|Negative
The box is so big it barely fit into my G-Wagen. This unit is much quieter than the one that was replaced. Easy to follow instructions. We had more trouble getting the old unit removed than installing the new evap cooler. Use a level to make sure the evap cooler is sitting flat. We installed this through an opening in the wall and used poplar to build a frame on the inside of the bungalow and cedar to build a frame on the outside. A strong volume of air comes out of it and it appears to be doing the job of cooling the bungalow. There is a bleeder hose that bleeds off some of the water when the unit is running. We attached this to some drip irrigation hose and extended it into the roses to water them.|Positive
Easy set up And puts out 65° On a 100° day|Positive
"Legs are,to short for the new 7000cfm master cool unit is 2"" longer"|Negative
This cooler/fan is a great alternative to using a portable air conditioner.It's light, easy to use and does a very good job at cooling smaller spaces. We purchased this cooler for our home after purchasing for my parents. They wanted a portable air conditioner, but didn't want the hassle of having to use the window/pipe version. This product works very well for them in one room and it has been working very well for a smaller space in our home. As a standalone fan, it seems to be more efficient than a regular fan. Using the water and ice paks adds an even cooler punch that is very noticeable. The section we used it in cooled down about 10 degrees within the hour. Regarding the quality, it is a nice design and sturdy, but the plastic bucket and mechanisms to secure and lock in are plastic - not so high quality. For the price; however, we will not complain and hope that they stand up to the constant use from refilling.|Positive
It is used in our garage that is pretty open as far as no ceiling and vents. But we roll it around and put it where we want and it works great. Love the oscillating fan. We let it run about 30 minutes before we fill it with water and we really have no complaints. It look and works great. Its exactly what we wanted and the price was great. We looked at used ones that were higher than what we paid.|Positive
Bought the wrong size|Positive
Ordered for Master Cool cooler, this product is made by Master Cool & fit perfect.|Positive
you get what you pay for, made in China piece of work|Negative
The cooler got here in fine shape. I am sorry to say that the only directions that came with it were in Chinese, so I have no way to order replacement parts when I need them. Is there anything you can do about that. Many thanks, Kathy King|Negative
Easy setup. Holds approx. 4 hours worth of water on high fan speed at 106 degree temperature. Puts out lots of air and is not too noisy for the high volume of air coming out.|Positive
The water pump in the machine broke within 30 days. For $150 I didn’t trust the durability and longevity of this machine. We returned for a full refund and will not be repurchasing. The humidity level was optimal for this unit but was just an expensive fan. We replaced with a $20 fan and are happier|Negative
These belts don't last even 90 days..I've gone through 4 of them in the last 2 years. I thought maybe my pulleys were out of line...nope, and no sharp edges. The belt that was originally on it lasted 3 summers before it wore out. These belts just don't last. They even feel like they don't have good rubber in them. Kind of plastic like. I wouldn't recommend these to the people who made them. I'll be looking for some real rubber. Might cost alittle more but worth not having to climb up on the roof when it's 100 outside. These are the Dial evap., belts. Lowe's sells the same brand Both places don't care they'll take your money.|Negative
good little unit easy to fill and see how much is in there...just kind of loud|Positive
Cools a small space very well. Fan is strong and blows cold air, especially with a frozen filter and cold water. Wish the light was stronger and could be turned on without the fan being on but overall very good.|Positive
Puts out tons of cold air. For the price it cannot be beat|Positive
This thing is awesome. The fan is quiet and powerful. It hasn't gotten too hot yet so haven't used the humidifier but I know it is gonna be great. I had to ask my husband to turn it down because I was cold just from the fan. Super stoked we got this! Bring on the heat!!!!!|Positive
It works, Thank s..|Positive
I have a 1300 sq foot area to cool and it works very well. I wish it had listed all that it came with it (belt, motor pulley, motor mounting bracket and motor attaching clamps). I ordered these all separate as everything would be at least a week out and I wanted to have everything here to make the installation. Very well built and works great.|Positive
Fit very well|Positive
This cooler is twice the size of the one being replaced. I had to have a sturdy stand built for it.I have only used it a few times but it seems to keep the area very cool! So far so good..|Positive
Our sunroom is unusable in the heat of summer. This unit has made the room comfortable during the hottest part of the day.|Positive
Good product!|Positive
The Evaporative Cooler Cover fit perfectly and was very easy to use.|Positive
I was interested based on the environmental friendly feature of the product but it didn't meet my cooling expectation. Convenience is limiting as well since you have to add the water and/or empty it so it doesn't sit in the unit if you don't run it until completely evaporated... Traditional air conditioners are MUCH more effective I must say for the limited air cooling needs I have in Northern NY state.|Negative
This cooler is great,I have two in my garage. You can move it around any place you need it and it hold 14 gallons of water,so it last a long time between fills. The price was 100 cheaper than my old mastercool and it cools five times better. It also has occialating louvers which is great in a big shop|Positive
Great buy !!|Positive
This is truly a great deal. We have a mastercool and I was trying to find an affordable cover that was also a decent quality, this fits the bill! Compared to other places /sites a cover for this unit costs $50+ Was able to buy this and 2 turbine covers and still had extra $ compared to the other sites! With this costing under $20 its a ridiculous great deal. The material is thick. We've had it on about a month now and we're happy with it!|Positive
Very happy|Positive
Just installed it this week, but already impressed. The real test will come when temps hit the usual 95˚+ this summer. But for now, I'm very happy with it. Of course, anything would be an improvement over my previously leaky unit. ;-)|Positive
If you are looking for a supplemental cooling device for a bedroom or small living room, this is the ticket!|Positive
Fits my cooler perfectly and installs with relative ease.|Positive
I have a smaller one I use in my shop that puts out more air than this thing!|Negative
Fits great!|Positive
The male threaded end was shorter than the part I replaced, but everything worked if I removed the washer from the assembly. The float valve now works perfectly.|Positive
Canvas turbine cover last several years, I have used them before and won't use anything else now that I have. When I took them off last winter I put them over my outdoor air compressor head and another small piece of machinery and didn't want to take them off to put them back on the roof so I purchased a couple more. These are well worth the money because they are decent quality and can be used for several seasons.|Positive
Good quality and quick online purchase|Positive
very attractive. I put it in my bedroom (we were experiencing 100+ days and 90 overnight. It felt good and cooled the air pretty well, considering we also had quite a lot of humidity. I even added ice to the tank and it helped. I need to call the company to ask about why it doesn't oscillate,|Positive
Fit perfectly. I used extra ropes to secure it since this cover covers just the unit and doesn't have cut-outs for the legs stands....not that I think it should. All in, it was a good buy.|Positive
Did what I expected... good for small outdoor areas It does blow the air hard which is good for outside|Positive
Puts out an abundant amount of fresh cool air. Had a faulty switch that burnt up and the warranty dept replaced the switch in a two day period without question other than the serial number, now it works Great!|Positive
I was surprised at how quiet it is and it gets the room so cold I turn it off. Of course being October in the desert it is not hard to keep a room cool. I'll see how it performs next summer but I am perfectly happy with it. Installation was easy. I picked it up at the store and installed it by myself. This was a replacement so the water supply line and the hole in the wall were already there. Turning it on for the first time sure made my day.|Positive
love it, just what we were looking for. It keeps the living room and kitchen cool and we turn the air down to save on the monthly bill.|Positive
I use this cooler in my Greenhouse which is 10 feet by 8 feet. It not only keeps the temp at 75, but keeps the humidity up. It runs off of a remote thermostat, so cycles off and on as required to keep temp at 75.|Positive
I installed this motor on a new Swamp cooler I purchased at the same time. Motor runs smooth and reasonably quiet. So far I have been running it almost constantly for over 3 weeks. So far, so good.|Positive
These units work pretty well. This one in particular has some spots of pretty shoddy construction--just my luck (I wish I could include a picture). Also, the parts aren't really high quality so something is always breaking.|Negative
Does the job... sucks not kept in stores|Positive
Cover installed as advertised. Had a greasy orangish layer on it which came off on my hands. Maybe that was part of the weather proofing? Just installed, so no long term results. Fit well on a 14 inch turbine.|Positive
love it..cools great..easy to maintain ...very happy with product!!!!!!!|Positive
"The cooler was easy to assemble. It takes a while to regulate the water intake and it cuts off the ""hose"" spray when it is about half full. So you have to continually play with the pressure on your faucet to get a constant slow flow to stay even with the use of the water pump using the water. Have patience and it is a great machine to cool off with. I have mine on the covered patio which has curtains to block the sun. It will lower the temperature about 10 degrees or more sometimes. Also, I called their customer service a couple of times the first week and got voice mail. Left my name and number, but never received a call back. So do your research on line. They have a lot of u tube instructional videos to watch."|Positive
More noise than original but right for the cooler|Positive
The cover Snap-on easy and secure and matches the swamp cooler.|Positive
I purchased this pump at the beginning of May 2018. I am very satisfied with the quality and performance. I have a 4000cfm cooler and this pump keeps the pad soaked and our home cool.|Positive
installed it and added water and turned it on. Works super!!|Positive
Probably the least effective unit for the money. Packing this up for,the ride back to,the store m|Negative
It is very powerful and pretty reliable .|Positive
Good, but it seemed to try to fit too many different models.|Positive
"Works very well. It is very cheaply made so dont expect to move over rough surfaces frequently and expect to stay together forever. Another person stated this. Also the ""smell"" someone said it had first few times was probably the cardboard that water cycles through. No biggie. Worth $. Very quiet!"|Positive
Keep in mind, this pulley is for a 1Hp motor. More than likely, you''ll need to purchase a larger belt|Positive
Unit broke after ONE running. Called company that told us control board was faulty and unit could not be repaired. Took it back to local store.|Negative
It works very well and is pretty quiet too.|Positive
Did the job it was designed for well.|Positive
I would recommend this cooler. Really surprised with the amount of cold air it puts out. I Have a rather large attic apartment, its been a life saver. Good for people that cant afford those unreal electric bills from an A/C Unit. Im having to fill mine about every 2 hours or so, but its worth it. Easy to clean, casters and nice handle make it easy to move, even when full. Thanks guy.|Positive
It's excellent and works great I'm so happy with this product|Positive
I bought three of these and all three have something that does not work exactly right about them. One of them did not work at all, one sprays water on the floor no matter how I adjust the pressure or the water streaming media and one shuts off every time you barely move it while it is on. Way over priced for what you get but evaporative coolers are really nice in hot dry climates.|Negative
This is not an air conditioner. For a swamp cooler this works great. I wanted a Porta-cool but I took a chance on this Hessaire because of it’s 3 large pads for water flow and the 3 speed motor. Oh and the fact that it was hundreds of dollars less then a comparable Porta-cooler.|Positive
Cools down instantly. But takes a lot of water. Need a hose connected all the time. Not recommended for small rooms, makes them humid.|Positive
Excellent, they work perfect as I expected.|Positive
I bought this unit to replace my old Champion swamp cooler. While the old cooler worked great, over time the metal was rusting out, and I finally had to replace it. This cooler was made of a heavy duty plastic so I thought it would solve the rust problem. While it was easy to install and the functions were nice, the unit did a very poor job of cooling. It was rated for a larger house than mine so I thought it would do a good job of cooling my house...it did NOT.|Negative
This does not work and is making a funny noise. It is huge and I will return it today.|Negative
Working perfectly. Restored cooler capacity!|Positive
Easy to install really out performed the cooler it was replacing Can not tell when it is running unless you feel the breeze the difference in the squirrel cage is nice.|Positive
"I have had a few other coolers over the years and was always disappointed with their performance and lack of quality. These guys got really close to perfect. This thing will out perform units costing over $1,000. It has 3 speeds and on low will clear a table of anything not weighted down from 10ft away. The thick media pads outperform the standard 1"" thick pads of other units. The best feature is the oscillating louvers allowing it to cover more area and can be turned off if so desired. Now to the not so good department. The instructions say to use a #2 Phillips screwdriver when installing the casters. Save yourself some grief and use a #3. Next is the float mechanism. It is adjusted with a thumb screw however, for some reason they put the thumb wheel to the inside right against the media making it very difficult to loosen/tighten especially when the process has to be repeated several times. Why they didn't put the thumb wheel facing the rear where there are no obstructions is a mystery. Now to the biggest flaw. While this unit wiill oscillate there are no louvers to adjust air flow up or down. It's great if you're sitting down but if you are standing at a work station or maybe working on a car engine the only thing that gets cooled is your knees. The designers opted for a pretty looking grill instead of actually being functional. That being said, I am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend."|Positive
Serves the purpose.I would really love to have a Oscillation option added.|Positive
"We just cleaned our Champion units for a house we bought but noted the cheap valve, pump, and pads. So we updated we much better quality components with a brass valve, a more powerful pump, and new High-Tech pads the allow better airflow. We have the two speed motor. Note there are oil cups on the pillow blocks for the ""cage"" so don't forget to oil these or you'll start to hear noises. In summary, buy a better and more expensive unit. This one is cheap but in the long run, you'll not save a penny."|Negative
Pleased that the straps held my cover in place without a hassle.|Positive
The fan operation was great. I found that it was just too humid to be satisfactory for our family. I will be returning the product.|Negative
These are awesome units, u can replace parts if you ever have to, everything is bolted on, unlike other manufacturers.|Positive
Need larger wheels. Difficult to read settings on top. Does cool average.|Negative
Easy installation for a great price. Beats the old Canvas Cover. Love it.|Positive
Excellent, value priced cover for outdoor use. We like this cover for many reasons and recommend it.. It is lightweight but strong, a heavy duty nylon type of fabric. Will hold up to strong wind. It is water proof for outdoor use. It offers UV protection. It has a drawstring around the bottom for a secure fit and a lace-up corner allowing for incoming lines. It has a built in vent to reduce condensation. This cover is excellent for covering evaporation coolers or central air condensers in the off season. It comes with a 2 year limited warranty.|Positive
This unit works as expected. We live in a dry climate and the unit provides the cooling needed and adds moisture. Only issue I have with this product is fan noise. The fan is noisy at low speed and gets louder on med and high|Positive
This is the second water pump I have bought and it has great volume of water for the swamp. Cooling is great because of the pump. Will buy again if this one quits hopefully is will last as long as the one I bought previously. Please keep in stock!|Positive
Overall, the unit has been working pretty well. Like most other reviews, the unit won't cool like an A/C because it's not, however, as an air cooler, it does the job! It does cool the ambient temperature down at least 10 degrees and the water in the tank lasts a while...for us it's been about 7 hours on average.|Positive
I've had my cooler for a couple of weeks and I have it on my patio. It definitely makes it more comfortable to be in the heat and I get more patio time with the cooler. The only problem I have with it, is the water level gauge doesn't work properly so I have to watch the level of water inside rather than use the gauge or else it will overflow. Once I've put the water in and adjusted the float by hand it does go down to indicate when the water is getting low. Other than that it's great. This is actually my 2nd evap cooler from Home Depot. The other one I had on my patio for 10 years!|Positive
Replacement belt fits and performs well for the price|Positive
I purchased portable evaporative , due to problems with main house A/C unit over holiday weekend. Unit worked really well and it kept house from getting extremely hot . I now have it out on the patio and use it out there . Unit works great.|Positive
"Easy to use portable cooler. It's tall at just under 45 inches, but it's lightweight and has easy to roll wheels. Portability is the key component of this cooler. Honeywell designed it with a low power draw so there is no problem running it on the extension cord, however, the unit is supplied with a 10 foot long cord that works perfect for me. Then the option to run on a garden hose or fill from a side filling port that gives the freedom of not having a hose draped across my patio. Just fill with water, power and go! The Honeywell can be used indoor but an evaporative cooler adds moisture to the air and I live in Louisiana which already has high humidity levels. But the Honeywell cooler still drops the temperature 10 - 15 degrees, depending on the humidity level outside. I use the cooler for mostly on my patio. It is quite enough to talk even with the fan running on high speed. The cooler has a number of features including a wireless remote (that operates all the features of the cooler console), two fan speed options, swing mode that directs the air side to side and a feature that allows you to run the cooler with just the fan. It is well built, durable and easy to clean the inside. There is very little maintenance for the cells. The only ""con"" I have is the difficulty with the drain plug. You have to almost tilt the cooler to remove the plug because of the low clearance of the cooler but other than that I really love this addition for our patio."|Positive
"If you purchase this portable evap cooler, get it in red. It's a beautiful dark winter red. This nice-looking cooler is like a quiet, hard-working robot - my husband dubbed it ""R2D2"" the moment we opened the box. The color makes it very likeable! The only assembly was attaching the air filters on the back - if that even qualifies as assembly! We use a large water pitcher to fill the tank with filtered water from our kitchen sink. Almost-daily filling is the only drawback. One way to make it easier is to roll the whole thing right over to the sink. This saves you from going back and forth from cooler to sink. Remember that this works differently from an a/c. If the air outside, especially at night, is not too warm, open your windows a bit to allow for good circulation. The evaporative cooler cools, humidifies, and filters the air. Every now and then I use a hand-held vacuum to clean the air filter from the back of the machine. Where we live it's very dry and dusty; the filter does a great job of trapping dust. I used to sneeze a lot every morning - that's stopped since we got the cooler - a nice unexpected benefit! When it's cool, we keep it running with the cool button ""off"". It has a relaxing sound and it's constantly filtering particles from the air. So far it's done a good job cooling. We got to hi 80's- low 90's recently. We'll see at least a few days near or above 100. When it was in the high 80's, we kept our large living room window a/c on which, on its own, barely keeps the bedroom cool. We used to use a huge fan to move the cooled lr air towards a bedroom and another lg fan in the br. The fans were marginally effective at best - none are needed now. With the lr a/c on and the evap cooler in the br, on the 1st or 2nd of 3 cooling settings, the br cools down beautifully. There is a 3rd setting for ""high"", so there's room for more cooling power . We had a few days with humidity >50% for a part of the evening; the cooler isn't at its best then. Fortunately, those were days we had rain & thunderstorms that cooled the air. The machine works well in dry eastern Oregon. Very happy with this purchase. Sturdy, well-built machine, simple to operate, works well."|Positive
Works like it's supposed to. Nothing bad to say about product|Positive
Quality of this cover is great but there is no choice of color. We ordered the large size to accommodate the window projection and it works. We have just put in on so do not know yet how sturdy it is nor how it will weather the winter. We were happy to have it delivered to our door. The price is fair and we would not hesitate to recommend it to others.|Positive
Keeps our shop much cooler than our last 4 panel cooler.|Positive
It doesn't do much for cooling but the fan works well. Say hi to Ashley S.|Negative
Arriving just tin time for Indian Summer here in Central Virginia this air cooler has kept our boy's room cool so that they can rest comfortably for several nights. One of the best perks for me is that it can be set on a timer and will turn off in as little as 2 hours. I like this because I don't have to worry about them getting too chilly as the night time temperatures dip into the upper 50's. Simple to set up right out of the box and light weight as well, this is a must have if you are looking to cool a room quickly and with ease. Love the remote feature and it makes an already easy to use product that much easier. I keep the remote with me so that if I need to change a setting I don't have to enter the room and risk waking the boys.|Positive
I have a Las Vegas NV well insulated small room house and prefer evap cooling most of the summer. These units are used in my primary rooms, I like the remote and the timer feature. Wish I could start them on a timer but you can't have everything.|Positive
Was easy to install and worked as expected.|Negative
A lot bigger than i though for 1000 square feet. materials are basic at most. I was honestly expecting a better quality unit. best way to buy one is go to home depot and see them in person Now i know|Negative
My previous one died and was returned. I purchased the warranty this time because I love this AC!|Positive
Easy to install, pre-wets media and functions as it should.|Positive
Living by the beach we rarely need air conditioning, but with construction nextdoor (killing our native breezes) and heatwaves, we needed something. This cooler does not give you an arctic blast, instead it gently cools down the room, is quiet and the added moisture is a plus. Solid purchase.|Positive
Way too expensive, Very Cheaply constructed, Don't waste your money!|Negative
Easy to put on|Positive
Ive had many coolers in my life and never one as cheaply made as this one. I have now put two parallel 11000 btu water pumps working with individual spiders just to attempt, with the poorly designed water system, to keep the pads wet. Ive widened the upper water try slits and rearranged pads. Nothing works.|Negative
This cooler is awesome!! It works GREAT. I’m extremely happy with it|Positive
Low price. It does great work with controlling my evaporative cooler. It doesn't seem to mind if you spin the knob clockwise, or anti-clockwise. It works both ways. I wish it would record video so I could see if my wife is having wild parties at home while I'm at work. I suppose I could ask my neighbor to spy on her...|Positive
Packing could have been better the corners were smashed|Positive
Had this type of cover for four years and it works great, Easy to put on and tie. Would recommend this product. Has withstood many strong winds and dust storms.|Positive
After a couple of months reading specs and reviews of similar products I am so happy that I purchased this unit! I create stained glass panels for a living and have a studio set up in 1/3 of our 3 car garage. My studio has a large window, but is not completely closed in with drywall so it's difficult to heat or cool. With our So. Calif. desert climate it's been impossible in the past to work in the summer after 10 or 11 am. I'm now enjoying cool temps and longer work days - yahoo! Our home has central a/c so I had no experience at all with evaporative coolers. The directions were surprising simple and other than putting the locking wheels on backwards in my first attempt (duh...), everything was smooth sailing and up and running within 2 hours of delivery. I would definitely recommend this product for ease of operation and maintenance, style and cooling power if you live in an area with low humidity where an evaporative cooler can perform at it's best. Kudos on a great product!|Positive
I tried this product in my bedroom to cool it down and I found that the temperature did get cooler. The room felt really nice and cool. The product comes assembled. I just followed the easy instructions and had the product up and running in no time. I just added water to the tank and turned it on. It has 3 fan speeds and with each level it really increases the air flow. The look is sharp and clean. The product is easy to move around and could be used in different areas. Covers up to 100 FT. Adds moisture to the air. No Freon or harmful chemicals. Remote control included. It is really 3 products in one, an air cooler, humidifier and tower fan. I am happy with the product and feel that it does the job very well.|Positive
The ice cold packs provided to keep air colder once frozen are a little to thin and small. Wish they were larger.|Negative
I had to purchase a replacement cooler from the same company because it matched the opening we have already for a cooler. We've used it for about 4 months this summer. It works better than the old cooler and does a great job for our upstairs. I'm not a fan of the aspen pads this cooler uses because they shed fiberous wood pieces in the bottom water pan and are a pain to clean up at the end of the season. Also I can't find a cover to fit this for the winter. None of the covers I've looked at are the proper dimensions to fit this. Anybody know where you can get a cover that fits?|Positive
Had this unit for 3 years, in southern california in the high desert it does great!!! Had to replace the blower motor half way through the 2nd year, It cools our 2 story 1800 sq ft house very well. just open a window a little bit at the opposite end of the house and an upstairs window and it does VERY well. Our hard water is very harsh on the pads and the pan, we use CLR once a month to clean it. costs about 1/4 of the the cost of AC. VERY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!|Positive
very cheap material bought many over the years for cooler seemed very brit ill seem like it sat in warehouse and dried out|Negative
The product worked just fine for the wc44 cooler. The problem was it shipped late with no notice. No response to my email asking Home Depot.com to find the product and shipping info or offer anything for the hassle. This was purchased for my elderly mother and the weather was cold and time to button up the draft. If I wanted this type of service, I'd shop the competition!|Negative
The cooler works great so far (only a month now), I can feel the cold air when the pump is on. It is perfect for outdoor use (it is too loud for indoor use). The good thing is that I can connect a water pipe directly to the cooler; otherwise, I would have to refill the water tank every 3 hours.|Positive
Great product, using it on our patio. Works better than expected!|Positive
Arrived damaged had to use parts I had to fix it. No time to wait for another one to arrive. Disappointing to say the least. :(|Negative
Unit was not made with high quality workmanship. I used it for my garage with the side door ajar and the garage door up about a foot to allow for air flow and exchange. It did not work well for my garage; although out on my patio in a totally open environment it worked pretty good - by blowing cool air on me. I would not recommend this product for a garage cooler, unless you completely open your garage door to let the humidity out.|Negative
This thing is a joke. I thought I was getting a good cooler but NO! I have had it 3 months and spent as much trying to keep it running as I did for the unit to begin with. It is 3 months old and I have had to replace the water pump and the pads a month go and today it is just barely blowing out any air and that air is not cool. I hate this thing! I am a 70 year old woman that can not climb up on the roof, so tomorrow is another call to someone to come look at and repair it and more $$ out of my limited retirement money.|Negative
This was easy installation and works very well. The only thing I would wish is that it be made of metal, not plastic for the money.|Positive
I had to replace the old switch because the knob kept falling off the old one. Eventually the knob got lost and it was time to replace the switch. I was pleased to see that they made changes in the knob and it is secure. No worries about it falling off again.|Positive
yes, this belt perfect fit for my air cooler, and looks strong to be in service for long time thank you home depot ..|Positive
I love the pretty red NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler I received free for review. Summers are now super hot in Colorado, so this thing will come in super handy this summer to cool me down despite our house having no A/C. It's less than 30 pounds, so moving from room to room is easy. The ionizing feature is pretty great, and the timing feature, too. If you don't have A/C (and you live in a dry climate), this is exactly what you need to survive summer. -Lisa @ Grandma's Briefs|Positive
Water pump is no good sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't|Negative
Great product , shipped to our address quickly, float level indicator was broken when I opened the box.Phoned the factory and it took two trys to get the right part because of part number mix up. The swamper was all I could wish for with several 100 plus degree days, I will purchase another one as they are a local factory with a complete parts list ,so the upkeep will not be a hardship.|Positive
The best. You should sell it in your stores, not just online. Much better brand than you sell in your stores.|Positive
Easy to install. Water tigjt.|Positive
This cooler comes ready to install, connect the float, screw in the drain fittings, hang in the opening, connect the water, plug in and turn it on. Simple and efficient.|Positive
This motor was a perfect fit for my cooler and works like a dream! I did not use the adjustable pulley that came with the kit, but instead used the original one I had. The clamps worked fine and were exactly like the original ones. Very pleased.|Positive
Your review boxes don’t necessarily work for some reason. Ac cover is excellent. Handyman said it was very good quality. Fit perfect. Fast delivery to store. I will order again when need to. Thanks.|Positive
This is quiet and blows a nice stream of cool air.Our porch is now someplace comfortable to sit.|Positive
We are very pleased with this cooler and would recommend to others.|Positive

Easy set up. Puts out plenty of cool air. Not too loud at medium speed. Really like it.|Positive
I purchased and installed this for my elderly uncle who lives quite a distance from town. I picked it up at the Home Depot and headed out to his place without looking it over first. That was a big mistake, this thing was falling apart. There were screws laying in the bottom that had rattled out because at assembly they had been stripped out. The unit was not square and where it goes onto the roof jack it was bent up pretty bad, it looked to be made that way. Horrible quality control. As mentioned my uncle lives out pretty far from a Home Depot so taking it back was not an option for me. I used some larger screws I had to replace the stripped ones, then my son and I proceeded to straighten out the opening to fit the roof jack. We also bent it back into more of a square shape so the pad frames fit proper. Now, although this was a bit time consuming it wasn't that difficult to bend being this cooler is made from very thin sheet metal (very flimsy). After it was installed on the roof I hooked up the water, pump, etc.. and don't forget you need to buy your own motor. The aspen pads this cooler comes with are a joke as well just like the cooler itself (cheap and thin). At this point all was working ok I mean it did blow cold air. Now 1 week later I get a call from my elderly uncle telling me that his new Champion Cooler is just blowing hot air (100 degrees plus on this day). When I got to his place I checked a few things out before climbing to the roof and all seemed well. Now on the roof, I open the cooler and notice the new Champion water pump this came with is not working any more (shocker). Luckily thanks to his local small hardware store they had a pump that would do. All fixed. I went back to Home Depot and complained the following day and they were great. I mean they did what they could and apologized but recommended contacting the manufacture Champion directly. They also gave me a new cooler pump free of charge. I tried to call Champion directly but that did not work out. So I contacted them through there web site and emailed them what had happened. Never heard a word back so I don't think they care much about their customers. In summary if you like fixing up brand new items before they are usable this is the cooler for you.|Negative
not happy with doors that hold cooler pads they are very difficult to get out and get back in, float is a cheap type float, cooler performs well and is very quiet, but would not buy this cooler again.|Negative
More than adequate. Very quiet. Used this to replace an old Sears unit, simple install. A/C is a joke in comparison and waste of money. Perfect for low humidity areas, in this case Nevada.|Positive
Works very well but uses a lot of water. Very happy with the results|Positive
This portable evaporative cooler was very easy to set up and I nstructions easy to read. The ice cubes definitely help for cooler air. We place it in the hallway to cool two bedrooms & it does the trick. Like the 10 hrs cooling!|Positive
Well made, great fit and good price.|Positive
Cover works well.|Positive
I think the price was fair the pads were a little smaller than my original ones. Works great though keeps my house cool|Positive
The right ones fit and work|Positive
Works well meets need it was purchased for.|Negative
We are in Az which has dry heat and this cooler is perfect in our Az room-screened in porch- we are able to be comfortable in 100+ heat. If the wind is blowing thru it is not as effective but calm days it is perfect. Understand this is not for humid weather when we get our monsoons it will be of little use but we bought it for the hot dry days of desert weather and it is doing the job.|Positive
heavy duty product, should be able to use for several winters. we'll see!|Negative
Excellent for small apartment with windows open|Positive
Perfect and thank you!|Positive
Home Depot order W835777186 cooler serial no. #00000116. I am concerned I installed cooler and then found paint missing in the corner of the water pan. it looks to me there was welding slag stuck in the corner and splatter. and now bare metal in that corner. see picture I contacted evap@hessaire.com with 2 different email address and no reply after 5 days.|Negative
I am in Tucson and it appears it came from the DC they have in Phoenix. Initial ship time quoted was 7 business days, but it arrived in just 2. That is just in time as today was the first 100 degree day and it is suppose to hit 116 this weekend. UPS driver was kind and set it inside my doorway as it is bulky but not heavy. I cut the band pulled the tall box off the styrofoam base and had it setup in about 10-15 minutes. I used some Crystal Geyser gallon jugs of water I had left over from a camping trip , I poured in two and the reservoir showed half full, so I assume it hold 3-4 gallons easily. It has been running for 15 minutes. I turned off AC in the house at start-up and it has held the initial temp in the house with the humidity rising from 24% to 57% in that short time. We shall see what happens after a few hours. The air it is emitting smells rubbery like wetsuit material that has been in the heat/sun -hopefully that subsides as it is used. I have been having sore nasal passages and slight nose bleeds from the super dry air we have had the past few weeks so maybe this will help. Our monsoon is coming in July so this will be only a short window to test it this summer. We anticipate using it well thru late October when the daytime weather finally drops below a bearable 78 degrees. The true test will be this weekend when the forecast is for 116 degrees-I will update the review after some really hot days|Positive
I am using this product for my pets. It keeps them comfortable in hot weather.|Positive
Awesome pump.... quite|Positive
It's pressed and minimal cleanup is done, but straight and includes the right size allen bolt.|Positive
The night time mode is terrific, given the intermittent on/off cycle which has a surf quality which is perfect for sleep... The water tank is large and I only need to fill it every three days or so... High really blows the air, but medium is sufficient and quieter... Overall, a great buy and worth the price...|Positive
Very good air cooler, full water run around 11 hours during 100 degrees outside. However the swing was a little noisy|Positive
Did not cool my room at all it worked as a fam|Negative
I recently purchased this unit and here is the good and bad of the product: The good: 1. The molded plastic body should eliminate most of the rust issues that happens with standard metal coolers. 2. The unit is mobile and cools sufficiently. The bad: 1. The pump failed after only 6 weeks and Home Depot does not sell replacement parts.I had to go through Port-A-Cool customer service during normal business hours to get a replacement pump under warranty. It took 5 days to get from Texas to Arizona and during that time the cooler was unusable. 2. There is no protective cover or grate on the cooler pad. It is exposed to where any child or pet can damage it. My dog found it to be a tasty wet treat in the heat. 3. No replacement pads available from Home depot. For the price of almost $800 out the door, It did not meet my expectations. Port-A-Cool needs to make some improvements on this product before I could recommend it.|Negative
"The cooler works fine but the referrals from Home Depot for installation are worthless and expensive. No more of this ""we will install what we sell"" business. I got one referral call and they wanted more than I paid for the cooler to install it. Bunch of idiots. I got a handyman to install it for 1/3 of what the Home Depot referral wanted."|Positive
So far it is powering our cooler|Positive

I purchased these 110V motor but after installed the first one, I realized that for this heavy duty job, I preferred a more heavy duty motor. Recommended 230-240V 3/4 motor for longevity and performance over energy usage|Positive
Doesn't cool well. I live in Tucson and it is really dry here. This is the third portable evaporative cooler I have had. I bought this brand because it has a large water capacity, was well designed, and with a presence in Tucson, I figured Honeywell would do a good job on the design. The problem? The evaporative media is too porous. Most of the water just drips through. So there isn't enough evaporation. In other brands, the top of the evaporative media is modified to spread the water out well, and soak the media. This one doesn't, and there are a lot of dry spots. I do not recommend.|Negative
"I LIKE THE PRODUCT BUT NEED TO REPLACE. CANNOT FIND NUMBER FOR CHAMPION TO ORDER THE CORRECT SIDE DRAFT OPENING OF 19 3/4 BY 19 / 3/4 AND TO MAKE SURE THIS IS THE SIDE DRAFT OPENING THAT IS THE CORRECT SIZE FOR A 20"" BY 20"" DUCT.

NO ONE SEMS TO HAVE THE CONTACT INFO OR SIDE DRAFT OPENING INFO"|Negative
They fit exactly and did not smell likesomeother reviewers reported.|Positive
I bought this unit in May and was pleased with its ability to cool my house more effectively than the old type with cooling pads in the four sides. I didn't install it and so had was not familiar with the insides. Unfortunately, when it came time to shut it down for the winter I was dismayed to discover that I had to unscrew over two dozen hex-head screws to access the insides. Not only is it an incredibly stupid design, apparently intended to make the necessary and regular maintenance issues that come with all evaporative coolers as difficult and inconvenient as possible, I was further disappointed to discover how insubstantial and cheap all of the components were. Vastly overpriced for what is actually there.|Negative
Just replaced my old pads with these and while they seem to work as advertised the odor they produce is awful. I am hoping this will dissipate with time, but so far it is nauseating.|Negative
exactly what I was looking for...swamp cooler for those hot, dry, days of summer....works great. Not too loud, but I've been mostly running it on low and medium....really nice airflow. Love the hose hook up option.|Positive
Shipping was fast and it fit|Positive
This product is just as advertised a very good buy .|Positive
We were not impressed with the Artic Cove Evap cooler. It does not blow very hard at all. The cooler makes a lot of noise but the output is very weak. We returned based on that factor. The functions are good, the timer is a good plus. If it weren't for the weak output, we would have kept it.|Negative
Save your money, did not cool anything.|Negative
We have this running in a bedroom. Very efficient a bit noisy but not too bad that you can't sleep through it.|Positive
Very effective at cooling main floor in two story house (12-15 deg cooler). Even on low setting, daughter complains its cold. Will reduce room temps on second floor, but not to the same degree as main level. Negative--horrible metal on metal rattle on high setting. Took two days to determine the location. Comes from where the fan casing is attatched to the main cooler frame (inside). Folded cardboard or foam and slipped it between these areas and the noise is gone, otherwise no complaints.|Negative
Fit perfect|Positive
Oh my goodness it is wonderful! It pushes so much air at you its like a wind tunnel. It has a cooling feature which is quite nice, and an ion feature which helps filter the surrounding air. This is an amazing fan! I highly highly recommend it.|Positive
Fit perfectly.|Positive
product performed as advertise. would purchase another one if I need one.|Positive
I am very satisfied with the cooler. I had a Champion window cooler for 20 year. Always performed well and minimal upkeep. This has 2 tubes leading to the pads to wet them. My old one had one tube to each pad. The motor is on top making it easier to get to. The motor on the old one was under the fan chamber. I love the improvements.|Positive
Was installed in 35 minutes keeps my large living room an kitchen cool|Positive
"So far, I really like this swamp cooler. We have only had it for a week, or so. It cools the whole floor, (1249 sq. ft), very well on low speed, and we have not had to turn it any higher, (except to try all speeds, of course). It moves quite a bit of air, but is quiet on the low speed. On the higher speeds, you hear rushing air, but i personally don't like it that ""windy"" even without the sound, so might only turn it up briefly in extreme heat. We plugged it into a switched outlet, and that outlet is switched by a thermostat, so the house should rarely, if ever, get that hot to begin with in my climate, (Southern Colorado). I am only mentioning this, because I have seen the noise level commented on in many reviews of various swamp coolers. There are no machine sounds, or any kind of humming at all. The house required installation on an extension ladder, so of course that was awkward, and required two people, but I don't think we would have gotten out of that with any cooler we would have put into that window. Still, if handled roughly, the little plastic ribs on the back cover can break. This was not enough to cause any structural damage to the unit, but it does have a ""ding."" I love the appearance of the unit on the outside of the house. It is streamlined, and not intrusive, so does not ruin the view of the house. Also the color blends in well. I may be back to update, once I have seen how it holds up."|Positive
We had this outside yet it keeped cool air blowing on us hard love it|Positive
Replacement pump for the pumps in my coolers. Easy to purchase and install on your own.|Positive
This cooler worked great in our 2800 sq ft home. We put outside the sliding glass door, with the sliding screen closed and opened the back and upstair windows in the house and the cool air blew right through the whole house. We live off grid, so the fan uses low energy and when the wind is blowing be just put the pump on and the sides of the cooler get wet and the wind passes through and continues to cool, using no energy at all. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|Positive
"These pads were a perfect fit for my evaporative cooler. They also seem to be more ""heavy duty"" than all the other Aspen pads I've purchased in the past. They seem to be more dense and do not lose as much of their inner material when installing. Beware tho, when they're wet and used in your cooler for the first few times they give off that ""wet wood"" mild oder. This is inherent of all Aspen pads from my past experiences and eventually goes away."|Positive
I have had this canvas, side-window evaporative cooler cover for about a month and I am very pleased with the quality of the product. It has weathered two winter storms with high winds, rain and some snow so far. It is well-made, the material is thick, water-proofed, and sewn together perfectly. The tie down string is strong and the cover was easy to install. I ordered the cover on-line and received it exactly when promised at the Home Depot store located at 10200 Coors Drive NW, Albuquerque, NM.|Positive
They fail to include the 4 plastic pins that hold the pad in, and these break very easily. How short sighted and cheap can you get? These are 35 cents of plastic, and they BREAK! Very dissatisfied and unhappy that they would be so obtuse to the customers needs.|Negative
Easy install. Works great. Runs quietly. Looks great on my roof|Positive
Product as you described. We are enjoying the result.|Positive
It is leaking water. Will be returning it. Just an expensive fan.|Negative
I've used and maintained many swamp coolers of many types for about 35 years. Let's be clear, it is trivial for manufacturers to make a motor that will last a decade or more of heavy use. So we will know if this motor is good after 10 years. I've had swamp cooler motors last 25 years, longer than the cooler frame. Any significant number of failures before a decade, means it is a bad motor, and shame on Home Depot for carrying it. From the looks of the other reviews, this is not a good motor.|Negative
Easy to install and well documented. Only issue I have is that the blue screen (lights blue when in command mode...) is difficult to read. The model I installed a few years ago had a better lighting mechanism. Overall - it really works well.|Positive
The string attachment was not sufficient to hold cover on the unit. We had to supplement with velcro.|Negative
fit perfect thanks|Positive
Poor performance|Negative
It's a good unit, not quite what I was hoping for. I wanted more power and efficientcy, but I am using two window a/c units also & adding the Hessaire did not perform as well as I had hoped it would. Overall rating 3.5|Negative
Exactly what I needed and wanted. Cools me when I sleep at night. Love the louvres so I can direct the flow of air to where I need it. I also like that it holds almost 5 gals. of water and will last through the night. And the size is great. Smaller than the ones I've had before. All in all I'm quite happy with it.|Positive
The machine works great but luckily I came with owner because there was a huge dent in the side you guys did give us a discount after I said something but it made me look like an dip because I said Home Depot is great when it comes to things be delivered damaged. other than that great.|Negative
Prepare to be covered in ceiling insulation. This product is awesome, but it is overpriced. That being said it functions perfectly and makes my home safer.|Positive
This is very interesting product. For a fan, this is little big, however, it has a water tank on the bottom. And this water can really cool down the room. I use it on the game room on the second floor for our kids and it really works well. Wheels on the bottom can make this easy to move. With the remote, it can be easily controlled. For hot summer, this is great addition. :)|Positive
This does the job. They are not meant to refrigerate the air, simply cool it down. I live in southern New Mexico, where we exceed 100 degrees during the late spring to early fall and this takes the edge off the heat so I dont have to run our ac constantly.|Positive
This is my first experience with this type of Evaporative Cooler. I think it is a very good design of quality materials but the first unit I received had some problems from the manufacturing process. The major problem was a fabrication problem that resulted in the Air Grill opening being too wide by 5/16 inch which caused the Air Grill to not fit properly. There also were 2 screws in the blower mount that had been overtorqued and striped out. The motor pulley wheel and the blower pulley wheel were out of alignment. There was considerable pad debris in the bottom of the water reservoir. There should have been instructions in the installation booklet to clean out any debris. There is no mention in the instructions that there are retaining screws that need to be removed to be able to slide the inspection panels up then out. The same applies to the 2 Air Grill retention screws. There are several omissions in the instruction book that requires the installer to be familiar enough to know those things. The manufacturer requested I have the unit replaced. I am currently waiting on the replacement.|Negative
Evaporative cooler pump failed and needed a replacement. Great recommendation from the Home Depot Staff. bought the right replacement pump at a reduced cost. Thanks Home Depot for having knowledgeable employees working the aisles ready to provide correct information!!|Positive
Northern Nevada desert heat. This is a powerful swamp cooler. I first hooked it to the hose and ran it for most of a day outside under the sun shade sail on a very hot day that was too hot to be comfortable and it made it very comfortable. At close range the low fan setting was adequate. Didn't notice much of the odor that others mentioned. The swing feature is great and makes it cover a wide area. Today we have 105 degrees outside and indoors 79 with a window AC running. Our humidity is 18% so just turned it on inside this late afternoon and it is very comfortable. It is quite big. Has cooling material on back and sides, very effective. One thing I like was going to their website they have all the parts for it.|Positive
Love it! Gets super cold using in living room. It cuts some heat in the garage on Texas nights when kids workout.|Positive
"The item was damaged when we pick it up (one corner was dent). It was my fault tough, for don't inspect the item. I'd trust & rely in H.D. ""Work ethic"" It was none Very disappointed"|Negative
keeps my sons room cool . he love it|Positive
Working great for my house. The only thing I like to see improvement the manufacturer is to cut down the noise especially when it is at higher speed setting.|Positive
Doubles as a fan and small swamp cooler. Clear and user friendly remote, panel controls and display. Love the vane moving back and forth over the whole fan oscillating, making it easier to position. Comes with sealed ice pack to keep water cold for those really hot dry days. Breeze mode is great.|Positive
Received as described.|Positive
the air conditioner was easy to set up and run, good instructions,,very easy to move with great wheels and can lock them in place if you want to.i do not see any problems with it so far.i have only used it for 1 week so far and it has kept my garage ,,[ 2 car] cool and it faces west evening sun..i am well pleased at this point|Positive
Just what we ordered and arrived at the store right on time|Positive
Worked perfect|Positive
Excellent design and quality. Need to purchase handles for access panels or you will be beating on them and prying them open with a screwdriver.|Positive
Simple to install good quality. What more do you need|Positive
This worked great - for one day. Then the motor stopped working. We returned the item to the store and the clerk mentioned that they had seen a lot of returns on it.|Negative
This cooler was exactly what I was looking for. It's the perfect portable cooler. On dry days, I use this cooler in combination with two ceiling fans to keep my entire house cool. It uses less power than a 100 watt light bulb, which makes it efficient enough to operate all day. Adding ice to the water tray helps bring down the temp. about 5 degrees. I do not recommend this evaporative cooler in humid conditions, but as long as the humidity is low, this cooler is a great way to save on your cooling bills and keep you very comfortable.|Positive
The float was stuck, but after alittle jigging the unit works great. I installed in a shady location and the unit blows 71°. The outside temperature 94 and hotter. I recommend the unit. Had 3 window conditioner's and now don't need any. Great saving!|Positive
The volume of air is good. Reasonably quiet, but the smell from it reminded me of dead fish. I did return the unit after running it 4 days, hopeful that the odor would go away. Not to be I guess.|Negative
"Looks good. Make certain your roof has clearance and structural strength for the unit--its much larger and heavier than the ""standard"" box unit."|Positive
The float wasn't angled the right way as our original one. Tried to put a bend into the float butthe cheap metal broke. Couldn't use it and just threw it away.|Negative
The product is well built, simple to operate and has a very powerful fan. On the negative side, it has a very small opening to add water. As far as performance, it made my very warm, dry garage just warm and humid. After a full day of use and a tank and a quarter of water, no cooling was felt. I had such high hopes for this item, but it would have been a waste of money so I returned it. Two stars is for quality construction and a powerful fan.|Negative
I bought this for a 360 sq. ft. room with no air. It significantly cools the room down within minutes. Ready to go right out of the box, just add water and plug in. I love the oscillating feature as well as the compartment for ice. It holds plenty of water so you're not constantly refilling. I highly recommend this cooler for beating the dry 100+ degree Tucson heat.|Positive
We find that in our dry climate we run out of water in about 6 hours so in the middle of the night it beeps to let us know about the low water level, which then wakes us up so that would be the only thing we don’t like about it other than that it seems to cool our room down pretty good!|Positive
I bought this to replace a 35 year old kensworth model. It was easy to install. Very light in weight which made it easy to get onto my roof. The design is one that will make it easy to maintain. That is a plus since my old cooler was a pain in the butt to do maintenance on. I would definitely recommend this model to anyone who it meets the needs of.|Positive
they fit well I just feel the quality of the material could be better|Negative
It was just what I expected, arrived when they said it would and was reasonably priced.|Positive
Best investment for my home this summer! Cooled house comfortably up and down without drying it out. Works perfect on low, quiet and efficient.|Positive
Assembly out of the box was easy. Love the 5+ gallon capacity. Worked great for one summer/fall. When we got it out this spring it won't do the evap cooler because the float sensor next to the pump isn't convincing the electronics in the switch panel that there is water in the container so all there is going on is either fan, or a beeping with the fan that lasts for one minute then the beeping stops. No evap cooling. Expensive unit too. Bummed out.|Negative
The last one I got was in service for over 20 years.|Positive
i live in the desert where a cooler is necessary. i bought this one to replace an old one. It was easy to install and worked great. the remote is convenient and easy to use. the duel speed fan makes the output adjustable. i have owned this product for about a month and it has already quit working for no apparent reason. it is spring right now so i haven't even been using it full time, just for a couple hours here and there. i have completely checked all connections, possible fuses, and the outlet is getting power, it will not turn on at all.|Negative
I was hesitant to buy this cooler based on the reviews, but I got desparate when desert temps went over 100. My Master bedroom is the hottest in the house, and this unit is a Godsend once you figure out how to get it to work its best. First, don't expect it to work in a humid climate. I only run the fan at night so the media is bone dry in the morning. To keep my room frosty cool, I place a couple of frozen plastic water bottles in the water tank when I fill it, and remove the media and wet it down (not soaked). Then just turn it on in the cooler mode and you're good to go. You only have to wet the media when you first use the cool mode, not every time you replace the water. This unit saved my life this summer!|Positive
We replaced the last year and they already died again Will buy in future|Negative
it is a great cooler just be sure to get it level very easy to install|Positive
Worked as necessary.|Positive
the motor for some reason did not come up to high speed, and had to take it back.|Negative
I ordered the 4-speed cooler, Model # 205065504, but received a 3 speed, Model CS10XE instead. The 3 speed model does not have the sleep mode that I wanted in the 4-speed model. The 3 speed's lowest speed, low, is a bit loud for sleeping. It has a timer that can be set for 1/2 hour, 1, 2 & 4 hours. This unit is a Honeywell brand.|Negative
Purchased this unit 7/4/17, was not as powerful as expected. 1 year later, medium speed does not work only low and high. Called on 7/7/18 - no replaceable parts and since after 1 year, nothing they can do. When you spend this much, you expect more. Dont buy!|Negative
These pumps do not last very long . And they're pricey. Wouldn't recommend but trying to adapt another brand pump hasn't proven successful either.|Negative
Worked well and heavy duty|Positive
The size and description of the cover was accurate. Since it hasn’t been through any significant winter weather yet it is hard to say how good the quality is. Just looking at it, it doesn’t appear to be as good as the last one I got - same brand.|Positive
Note to buyers . Check for loose nuts and bolts. One bolt was replaced by myself where the motor is attached to. The 2nd bolt was a tougher replacement since it was a bolt holding the brace of the fan and you could not reach behind it. Had to force another bolt into that spot.|Negative
Ive had a Master Cool for 12 years. I upgraded the motor to a 1 hp to give it a bit of kick, it has cooled several homes Ive lived in. Now Im moving to another new home I purchased and I plan to buy another. The old one still functions perfectly so it is going into my detached garage and shop for use. While the initial price is high its well worth it seriously I dont have the high AC bills my neighbors do and everyone who comes to my house says its feels really cold. Plus all the stale air isnt locked up in the house its constantly recirculating fresh air and I like that.|Positive
I use this to cool down my 3 car garage/shop (720 sq. ft.) in the Las Vegas heat. At 114° outside, my garage gets down to 82°. If you turn the pump on for a few minutes before you turn on the fan, I have found that it cools down a little quicker. Great unit if you spend a lot of time in the shop.|Positive
fit great|Positive
Now that all parts are here it is great.|Positive
This unit definitely pumps out the cold air, so much so that we find ourselves having to turn the pump off and keep just the fan on as it has made the room too cold. My only real complaint so far, as the unit has only been installed for a little over one month, is that there are only two fan speed.|Positive
The pump holds 10.5 gallons of water. When it runs out, there is no automatic shut off. This means if for some reason you do let it run out, the pump will burn out within one minute. It is hard to gauge how many hours of overtime depending on climates 7 to 8 hours?|Negative
Fit great and made very well.|Positive
Seems to be quality pad material like the Munters original pad|Positive
Product is very nice looking but not very effective. How long can I leave the water in the cooler before I use it again or should I remove the water? Also 3 days after I bought it, it went on sale.|Negative
The pillow has a very durable feel to it's surface and appears that it will clean very easy prior to storing for the summer. The fit is snug. While handling the pillow during installation the feeling it provides is one of confidence that it will last for quite awhile. This is a very simple and effective solution for sealing the housing.|Positive
"Did not last one full season. Up until it stopped working about 3 months into the summer, it was fine. It seems cooler pumps are only designed for a, ""One year use"" item. I have had the cooler for six years, and been through four pumps, various manufacturers. The only pump that lasted two years was the original pump that came with the cooler."|Negative
This cooler was very easy to install. Cools more than I expected for it's size. And the design of it give me space on my porch to move around freely. It is just a little louder than I expected, but cools so well I don't need to leave it running at night. The price was amazing. I love it.|Positive
It's a little louder than my fan but cools the room way better than a fan so I'm ok with it. I read so many reviews of different evaporative air coolers and was worried it would just make the room humid and be really loud but so far so good. The only negatives I have is that the wheels get weighed down by the water in it so it doesn't roll from room to room very easily (I'm not very strong so lifting and carrying it to move it to another room is out too) and in a perfect world is like it to be easier to get the water in. It's not difficult but takes a little time. Overall I'm very happy I purchased it and enjoyed it through the heat wave this past weekend.|Positive
Product does not cool a room of 150 square ft. My wind tunnel is use to assist the air flow.|Negative
This my 3rd. Controller, each on a different cooler. It's a new design. Now you can adjust the soak time of the pads from 0, 2 or 4 minutes. I installed this latest one too close to the cooler so the temperature reading is off but that's my fault. These are great had the other 2for years.|Positive
"On a hot day, it's cooler inside my house than outside (because of insulation, and keeping the blinds closed). For example, today it's 85 or 86 outside and 77 inside. But that's still warmer than I'd like, and I was hoping that this device would make the air inside the house cooler. But, for this device to work, you have to have TWO doors and/or windows open (one behind and one in front of the device). The manual actually says that it draws ""hot"" air in from outside, cools it, and then sends that air back outside again. So, basically I'm paying to cool down the air outside, huh? The air inside is only warm, not hot, so I was hoping that I could get a machine that would simply cool it down a little. But, no dice, at least not from this machine. If you actually sit in front of it then you get a localized cooling effect from its draft (like a fan, but a bit better due to the cold water and ice, for the brief time that that lasts) but it's not capable of actually cooling an indoor space. The space I was hoping that it'd cool is well within its specs. Essentially, it doesn't work. I would advise avoiding it."|Negative
I use the float switch to control the level in my pool. It is easy to install, it easily fits in the limited space available and works great.|Positive
Received my unit promptly and the minor assembly was easy and straight forward. At first I ran the unit in my 3 car garage with only the entrance door open and the garage door cracked open. The cooling was effective and added quite a bit of humidity which is fine in Nevada. Since then I have found that just opening the garage door and directing the air flow to the area I am working in works very well and reduces humidity build up. I am very satisfied with the performance of this unit in my 900 square foot garage and the price is excellent .|Positive
Product arrived few days early. It was easy to install and it's a good quality.|Positive
Ordered online, and my mother picked it up out of state. The local store had it in stock, thankfully! (Her cooler was 30+ yrs old). This cooler cooled her home nearly 2 degree per hour (~1500 sq ft). No complaints. Looks great. Easy to install. Will order online again!|Positive
Does as well or better than MasterCool at half the price!|Positive
Vincent made everethening easy and possible. I thank you for that! The best customer service!|Positive
Small unit cools great use it in Yuma, Arizona when have tile put in my house without having the A/C run with the doors open. Installer loved it so did we.|Positive
I'm sooooo happy with my purchase of this product, easy to install, didn't need a crane, kept my house cool throughout the summer, works better than the Master cool I had before .|Positive
It does a good job of cooling off room when used in conjunction with air conditioner.|Positive
I purchased this unit for my one bedroom apartment and it is perfect for small spaces. I fill it with 2.5 gallons of water and it cools the room the entire night. It is perfect for spot cooling and uses very little energy. It was worth the money I paid.|Positive
"Purchased as a replacement for my old ""Swamp Cooler"" that was quitting after 10 years of major use. Bought the same make and model, because of the trouble free usage I had with the old one. This one is quieter and much improved including a remote control. It cool the air throughout the house around twists and turns. Couldn't be happier."|Positive
Cools very well. Moves a lot of air. Only complaint is that the fan is not quiet. Crank it up to high and it sounds like a Cessna is about to park in your home. I used a permanent install and it worked very well. $50 back from local power company.|Positive
Machine is pretty but I have to return it. I was trying to cool down my office space and this absolutely did not come close. It’s more of a desk fan than a room AC.|Negative
"WARNING Pump does not come with the screen OR the hose adapter & hose that is needed to install the new pump on coolers older than 2017 The part that is needed is a 3/4 to 1/2 inch coupling because the new pump has a 3/4 inch male outlet and the old ones have 1/2 inch. You will also need a short piece of 3/4 hose. These ""parts"" are listed on the instructions for the new pump, but, they are not shown on this website."|Negative
Cools the room . The size is perfect just what we needed for a small space.|Positive
Tool ago polished what it was designed to do and was priced right.|Positive
"Okay, I didn't put it in a swamp cooler, which is what it's designed for. I used it as an emergency sump pump to remove about 4"" of water from my basement. Granted, it didn't pump very quickly, and I had to use a couple adapters to connect it to my garden hose, but it cleared my basement in under 14 hours... and that was a lot of water. I highly recommend it for its intended purpose. If it can clear my basement, I'm sure it can handle a swamp cooler just fine."|Positive
This product worked great on my patio; even my dog was drawn to it. We can sit on the patio during the hot Texas afternoons and watch our kids swim; and stay cool at the same time.|Positive
We use it in the garage so it really can't cool that big of an area, we should have gotten a more powerful cooler. Its ok if you are in one place for awhile, better than a fan. I might add we live in Arizona and its summer, so nothing really cools you off.|Negative
It's rigid, lasts a long time, and fits snugly. Also stays cool when soaked. Perfect - for my swamp cooler.|Positive
This is my second purchase and both are working perfectly.|Positive
All you do is put the wheels on add water plug it in. Very happy with the cooler. Let's us use the patio in the summer heat.|Positive
Works like a champ to cool down the dance floor and our weekly parties. Have yet to try it under the worst Santa Anna conditions though.|Positive
The cooler shut off when the water tank is only half empty. Does not last all night, the cooler will beep a few time letting you know the that the cooler part of the unit is shutting off. Just I want I want to hear in the middle of the night|Negative
Good performance and durable.Very helpful in the summertime. Quite and convenient.|Positive
I have a 2-story home with high ceilings. The last two years, I have used standard A/C window units to cool the house. After a ridiculous utility bill or two, I decided to give the Mastercool a try. It is installed in a downstairs window, and it cools the entire house!! I use a cheap window fan, pointed out, in an upstairs room to create draw throughout the whole house. My utility bill was $100-$150 less per month through the summer months and we stayed nice and cool. Awesome! I definitely suggest installing the optional purge pump. Keeps the water fresh and clean, and keeps scale from building up.|Positive
This thing is a piece of garbage the 16$ box fan next to it does just as good s job , I have this in a 10 x 10 and it doesn't even come close to cooling the plants , it doesn't do Anything really, waisted 180$ on this crap|Positive
These pads are awesome and a the world of difference. I will buy more soon.|Positive
Excellent product. I replaced the synthetic fiber pads with this new pads and the cooling efficiency improvement was really notorious.I highly recommend it.|Positive
Looks the same as the more expensive ones except for the float.|Negative
In July of 2005, yes I did type 2005, I purchased this Bonaire unit at a Home Depot in Boise ID. It got a lot of use until I moved in 2012. It was left behind in a shed and the house has been rented out since. Well this year my darling wife and I had to go up to Boise and do some repairs on the house. We brought the cooler back to Nevada with us. I set it in the window, got the hose connection at Home depot and the tubing. Turned everything on and it works like a charm. Same pads also! We have a small, 950 sq' house. It was 91 degrees outside and 70 in the house. After 7 years heavy use and 3 years baking in a shed I am impressed, and most importantly so is my darling wife!|Positive
OK - I have installed the equivalent product Home depot used to carry many times without problems. Just installed the first of these and it leaked, the molding at the base inside was leaking. Of course didn't find this out until it was installed. No problem with HD but lost half a day uninstalling it and back to HD to get the replacement etc. Also can't see how to install a thermostat - this has an electronic control - so will not operate with an attic fan thermostat unlike the other brand. I have six orders for installations - starting to feel a little uncomfortable!!!|Negative
Just what I needed to cover that rusting out non used evap cooler.The fit is just right with room to spare for shrinkage during monsoon season here in AZ.Glad I decided to order it.|Positive
I am pleased to be able to find a cover for my air conditioner. However it would be nice to find one that would fit properly. I had to cut this up 3/4 from the side so that it would fit over the electrical connections. The cover that I had before fit perfectly and it didn't come with it.|Positive
I purchased the unit for a small area and for short-time usage. It works perfect for the small area that I have placed the unit! It meets my expectation!|Positive
Best bang for your buck when compared to other competitors selling the same style swap coolers.For the price it was worth the size and amount of cfm’s.Works great and I have no issues thus far.|Positive
Good fit. Thank you.|Positive
Our 14 year old UltraCool ADA70 Evaporative Cooler had a problem with the cooler motor not running at full speed at the highest setting. We ordered this Dial replacement motor from HomeDepot and it came in a couple of days and easily and precisely replaced our OEM motor. We were able to use the existing wiring and pulley and simply replaced it. Our cooler now works very well with this new motor just like it did originally 14 years ago. It was expensive but seems of great quality.|Positive
very attractive and does the job it's ment for|Positive
It would be nice if a more resilient paint was applied so they do not rust out so soon.|Positive
Just covered our unit. I thought this would have tie downs (around opening for pipes it does) It states on package that extra tie downs may be necessary. I didn't 'see that on site when purchasing this cover. Looking at the cover it may not need the extra tie down, will find out later in the season.|Positive
They had broken pieces and a funny odor|Negative
We bought 2 of these coolers last summer June 2013 and they ran all summer just fine. 1 was in the living room and 1 in the master bedroom. They were a pain to put together since the instructions were horrible. If you don't have a window slightly opened next to them it will make the room feel humide, and they are pretty load when you have it on high and the pump is running. Toward the end of summer last year one of the coolers pump sensor stopped working properly and would not allow the pump to come on even though it was full of water, this was simple to fix by just getting into the control panel and undoing the wire for the sensor and once I did that it would run just fine only con about that is it will not let you know anymore that the water is getting to low but if you pay attention to the water level gage on the front or know how many hours your cooler has been running you will know when to fill up again. The nice thing is 1 full tank of water can run for a good 6-7 hours continuously. The reason why I only gave these a 3 star is because when we got them out to use for this summer (just a week ago) the fan motor on one is over heating and will not turn the fan and the pump on the other one has stopped working. Now I cleaned these coolers very well before storing them for the winter and didn't think we were going to have a problem with them but to our surprise and disappointment they only survived 1 season of use. Now since they didn't hit their 1 year mark for the warranty I was lucky enough to be able to call the company and get a replacement pump for one and they replaced the whole cooler for the one with the broken fan motor. Who knows if we will have a problem this summer or next and now the warranty is up on them in a couple of days. I think I still would not recommend this product because of the short life expectancy we had and knowing others have had the same issues we came across.|Negative
Works great. Fairly easy installation. Would recommend.|Positive
Since I have received this unit my electricy bill has gone down. I just put the unit in the room I'm in, add the ice packs to the water tanks and I've got cool air blowing! I really enjoy that the unit is on wheels so it's easy to move around the house. I just roll it into the bedroom when it's time for sleep and I set the timer so I don't worry it's on all night. All around a great alternative to air conditioning and the huge bill that comes with it.|Positive
We just purchased this a couple of months ago and it has performed very well this far. While we haven't had the chance to test it under real hot temps, during those days when the weather was quite warm it almost ran us out of the house since it put out so much cold air. Granted, when the summer temps arrive in a month or so it will surely be more challenged, but I'm certain that it will be up to the test. The cooler puts out a good bit more airflow than our previous one, even with the same HP motor. Also, the remote is a nice addition making the cooler's operation more convenient. Bottom line is that it is definitely a worthwhile investment for those of us who are fortunate to live in areas of the Country where the humidity is low enough to allow the effective and efficient use of such an appliance.|Positive
this cooler is placecd on a second story house in the hot/dry climate in california. it has provided us with a cool environment and we with help from friends got it on the roof!|Positive
Product did not fit the outlet for swamp cooler. I had to purchase another. I would like to return this pump if possible, so my money is not wasted|Negative
Got my swamp cooler back up and running properly!!!|Positive
I've been really pleased with this unit so far. It is exponentially better than the 4500 CFM cooler that it replaced. Compared to similarly spec'd competitors, it is quite a bargain, and it won't rust. Airflow at 25 feet is great, and it has an oscillating feature which some may find useful. On the down side, but easily overcome, two of the wheel mounting threaded brackets stripped easily. I found lock nuts and washers and was able to install the casters securely. Also, the fitting provided for a direct garden hose hookup was not correct. With the tank full,it lasts many hours but will have to be replenished daily. I found this online and had it shipped to the closest Home Depot and picked it up myself to avoid shipping cost. The folks at the store were great, got it taken care of and helped me load it in my truck.|Positive
Works good|Positive
was not good for texas hot weather . Made room very humid and hotter. Returned the product|Negative
I have several high-priced helmets, but couldn't see paying the high price of some of the helmet bags out there. After seeing some high ratings on this bag, I ordered several and have been exceptionally pleased. The bags are well made, have just enough padding to protect the paint and visor without being bulky, and easily accommodate the large helmets. The non-skid bottom and padded carrying handle are bonuses. Great quality and surprisingly low price.|Positive
easy set up and good customer service but this unit does not cool at all- merely a fan|Negative
Perfect product for my needs with my swamp cooler. Perfect size and price!|Positive
Cover fits exactly. Like the color, goes well with my brown shingles roof.|Positive
Great price, free shipping, that's the good part. Bad part; The smell of bug spray never goes away! We have run our a/c on these new pads for 2 months now, and the smell is terrible! Not happy with these pads!|Negative
Good purchase, have to put ice in water in order for it to be cool and set it up on something, doesn't work good from the floor and doesn't cool much space|Positive
The pads went in easily & dropped the temperature another 5 degrees.|Positive
Excellent product at good price. Unfortunately, it was the wrong size for my older model Master Cool.|Positive
this fan does what it says. creates a cool flow of air and when the cooling pad is utilized it's like having an a/c unit in the room.|Positive
Perfect fit! Toally takes care of the draft that would come through in the colder months while the evaporative cooler wasn't being used.|Positive
This item was easy to install and adequat4ly cools the are I needed.|Positive
Fit fine, been in use for a couple of weeks, no issues yet, should last thru this season.|Negative
Had 2 swamp coolers and 1 freon last year, now I just have the new one I just got.|Positive
I installed this in my garage on a rolling dolly. The last three weeks it's been over 100 outside, even hotter in the garage. But with the garage door open and the cooler blowing directly on me while working on the car, it's great. I calculated that it uses about 5 gallons of water every hour which is not much considering how cool it keeps you. But it's been very low humidity here over the hot weeks averaging 10%-12%. Do not use with garage door closed as it will increase the humidity and make you sweat more while working. Overall, I like it a lot.|Positive
The evaporative cooler works very well. We used it in the garage when doing small projects and using it this week as we do Vacation Bible School. We have a line of people checking in so the door is open and in 100 degree weather it keeps all those cool during check in. It is also important to note that in the Southern California desert where we live there is no humidity.|Positive
Purchased for my rental property and my renters gave it 4 thumbs up! It was installed with no problems by my highly trusted handyman. Full stars! Thank you, Carolina Lopez|Positive
XLNT Well packaged,in perfect condition ,all parts work good.Instructions are easy to follow,made in America . Very satisfied customer.|Positive
I live in Colorado and it is always dry. When summer comes I fire up this evap cooler and not only does it cool the home well, it ads needed humidity to the house. just turn on the cooler and open a window at the other end of the house and you have a nice cool house. Great Item...|Positive
Ok had to replace the float.water would not stop dripping.|Positive
The unit cools well but, I wish who ever had it and shipped it took more care when handling. If it wasn't for my disability and being susceptible to the heat wave that was coming I would have returned the product. I am a little perturbed that I spent $900.00 dollars on a product that was dented and scratched up. I guess this serves me right for dealing with a big box store.|Negative
Exactly what the swamp cooler was designed for|Positive
High quality and a good price|Positive
Design and assembly lacking but with a little tinkering by me I was able to work out the deficiencies and not have a product that works very well|Negative
My air is out in my office and it is 91 degrees inside. The EVC 350 has absolutely no cooling effect. The cheap fans in my office are doing a better job.|Negative
The unit produces a decent amount of cool air but the water resivouir is not removable which makes it difficult to fill & empty. It is a large unit so moving it/lifting it to empty the water is a pain.|Negative
It will be more than average if: - the cord longer - the machine need having the hook so that the cord rest on it when the machine isn't in use. - It need an instruction with picture in order to access any part of the machine.|Negative
Heavyweight, fits snugly, I expect it to hold up very well. Much better than those lightweight plastic materials, my last one of that type lasted one year.|Positive
I have used these for years. The new models have a minor drawback in that you have to wait for the pump delay even to run the fan only to vent. The old models did not delay the fan. If this was addressed, I would have given it 5 stars. It is the only way to fly if you are a day sleeper.|Positive
Easy to install and runs very quietly.|Positive
not very effective in cooling a 120 square foot, well insulated 'she shack'|Negative
The cooler was easy to assemble and a good value. The customer service at the Pro Desk was good.|Positive
Works as intended, but the hose inlet leaked and the float valve failed causing water to overflow. I just resorted to filling the unit manually and it cooled well. The fan is very strong and moves a lot of air. Makes working in the garage bearable in AZ summers.|Negative
Evaporative cooler pillow. Works great. Keeps heat from leaving through my ceiling now that winter is approaching. Was easy to install.|Positive
"We bought this cooler just before ""Monsoon Season"" arrived, so I haven't had much chance to try out the cooling part of it, but it moves lots of air through my wrap around porch. Does a much better job than the two large floor fans I was using. I'm looking forward to drier weather so I can check out the cooling on it. It already makes it cooler, just with the amount of air it moves thru the porch. I really like the oscillating feature."|Positive
.need 3 hands - 2 of them the size of a 10 yr old|Positive
Live in Arizona and previously had external downdraft cooler attached to the house(which no longer exists). I would recommend this if an indoor cooler is needed which is easy to move around inside the house as needed providing you make sure there is enough water as needed. Otherwise if not using the pump option this covers a great amount of space based on the floor plan you may have. For outdoor use you can attach a continues flow of water from a garden hose(attachment provided) as needed. I was really impressed. Be advised however if using inside the use of the air flow is somewhat loud and you may need to adjust to it, outside on a patio this is a really good choice and well worth the cost for long term use. Great construction which will live a long time. Be sure to read the instructions as most people do not.|Positive
first one died after a month and a half got a replacement one died after two months..so totally aggravating|Negative
Buying this product without feeling how totally lightweight the materials and construction are was a mistake. The cord came jammed into water storage drawer and when I called customer service, I felt like I was speaking to a young girl with a how to manual, in her garage or something. However, the return was a Snap, and I received my refund promptly. Your better off with a nice fan.|Negative
Did not lower the temperature of the room at all.|Negative
Very efficient, and best of all, very quiet. We previously had one considerably higher priced that was very loud! We are very happy with this purchase!|Positive
It’s bigger then I expected and not too attractive for how much space it takes, but, If it does what it claims I’ll adapt. My area is just starting to get to triple digits and I have not gotten a water or electric bill to compare. The one day I used it all day I had to keep filling it with water.|Positive
This unit leaks continuously. The company that makes them never responded to our calls for assistance. Save your money and by something that actually works.|Negative
We had previously ordered two similar units locally that had worked without any issues. We decided to purchase this particular unit, however it arrived and it did not work. I am in the middle of returning it. If you spend $$$ I expect a product to work especially from this Store. Ra|Negative
New cooler has been performing very well and keeping our house nice and cool. I am very happy with it.|Positive
Ordered this product for my daughter in college. She absolutely loves it. Works great at cooling her room.|Positive
we found the cover to be a sturdy canvass.it was easy to install we would recommenfd that you purchase the strapes tp go around the cooler they are not included|Positive
Even though this type of cooler is not recommended in north eastern states, we found it very useful to beat summer in our top floor apartment in Connecticut. The ice feature is good but the ice chamber is too small, ice get melts in minutes. however the cooler helped us a big extend to beat this summer. *****DO NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME OF A AIR CONDITIONER********|Positive
This is not an AC unit.|Negative
I bought too large a unit; air moves throughout my living room, dining room, and kitchen; enough to make chimes on back door ring!|Positive
It needs more feet i had to make shift this|Negative
Summer months in the south can be brutal, keeping our daughters room cool is a must. Without having central air we decided to give the LUMA COMFORT EC45STower Evaporative Cooler a try, when used with ice packs the cooler keeps her room at a comfortable temperature. I wouldn't recommend it for a bigger room, but will keep a smaller room cool.|Positive
This up dux was easy to install in no time. Not to many moving parts. Good instructions that makes it easier to finish the install.|Positive
Good dollar value. Limited settings, instructions on settings are suspect but they get the job done cooling a room. Very satisfied.|Positive
It is very easy to operate, works well in our climate and keeps the house nice and cool.|Positive
Excellent unit so far. Works almost as good as my portacool unit that is 4 times as expensive. Love it.!!|Positive
A little short than expected. I had to adjust the tension to the maximum short possible, but works great.|Positive
I bought this cooler last night to try to eleviate some of the Colorado heat for the summer and it barely even blew the air ahead, much less cooled anything. I was hoping that the design had changed since all of the previous reviews were 2+ years old. But even two years later, not much has changed and I wouldn't recommend this product. I returned this cooler this morning and spent the extra $100 to get a portable air conditioner. Totally worth it.|Negative
It fit good.|Positive
Value and quality any size. Just wow Surprised to see it fits a big full size helmet Ties down to my Ultra with ease. Now more space|Positive
The cooler works perfectly. It's much better than our old cooler. It was easy to install, the instructions are clear, and the warranty is great.|Positive
I just received the EC45S. The box looked like it was strapped to a donkey that swam across the Pacific from China with the fan strapped to its back. Instructions were missing, as was the remote. (Unit runs fine). Was able to find the instructions on the website and downloaded them. Also found a link for support, so I sent an email about the remote. I had no expectations that I would hear from anyone, as I assumed anyone that makes a donkey swim across the ocean probably doesn't care about customer service, but I was wrong! Within an hour of requesting a remote, I had a response back from Ashley in California saying she would be happy to send me a new controller. After I sent her my order confirmation, I got a personal note back from her saying the remote was on it's way, as well as the UPS tracking number for it. This is customer service at it's best! Ashley did a great job and Newair should be proud to have her as a Customer Care representative!|Positive
Took some effort but all good things do|Positive
It unfortunately didn't seem to cool at all. Purchased the product to cool just a back bedroom and felt no difference. We returned this and bought an old fashioned fan on a tall stand and have had much better results.|Negative
Wonderfully|Positive
The lighting indicator for when the pump is on stopped working|Negative
I had purchased this fan for an outdoor camping trip my wife and I were going to take and it works really well. The air that comes out is great and the speeds are perfect. The only issue I had with it is the cooling. When you turn the cooling on, the water that it suctions begins to leak out of the fan and spray out. At first I thought it might be like mist but it just spits out water. The only resolution was to start it off on low speed and once the evaporator collects enough water them kick it up if needed. I might be doing something wrong and I wouldn't be surprised but this was my experience with it. Still a great fan and now we use it in our bedroom...a bit noisy but I actually like it that way.|Positive
This 4000 cu ft replaced a 6500 unit that was 30 years old and too rusted for further repair. Construction is almost identical with a few minor improvements. Easy one man installation high on a wall once I dismantled it into small pieces. Only negative was the price, it seemed steep considering there was no motor, but I couldn't find anything lower. On low speed it cools 1400 sq ft house on 'low' setting on a 95 degree day in the desert.|Positive
Good resistent|Positive
I am so pleased I am buying another. Love the remote, the timer, the osc. I fill it with a garden hose. I live in Las Vegas so evaps work well most of the time.|Positive
The water bin had a lot of filter paper scraps that I was afraid might clog the pump. When I filled the water bin, the float was hung up on the electric wire and the water level indicator was bent. I corrected these fairly easily after removing the back. This would have been easier if the instruction Manuel told how it comes off. I am not sure that everyone could or would want to do all this with a brand new product. Once it was back together it worked well.|Positive
Works excellent, actually cools my smaller house . Place it in garage and point into house, I open garage door a few feet for air flow into garage. . I open a few windows on other end of home so air can exit. I use the natural air flow of the home, it helps. 1,400 sq ft home., Drops Tempe about 4 to 6 degrees. Uses 490 watts running( I checked it with a meter). Important drain water the first few times, it has a smell that does go away, its sprayed on the pads when manufactured. No worries, I actually like to drain it from time to time to keep it fresh. Very easy to fill and drain. I would highly recommend it. The larger unit works great too. We saw them at a fair in Phoenix, az. I thought they cooled great there too.|Positive
They cover my turbine ok. I used tie wraps to help hold the covers down. In strong winds, it would float. And the turbines would spin. Next time I'll put trash bag under them. There's plenty of ventilation in the attic in the winter. Bought them so can work up there in the winter and not be in a wind tunnel..|Positive
Cooler delivers as advertised. Very good cooler. I only wish it had come on wheels.|Positive
Great Cooler! 105 outside 80 inside !!I added a quick connection to the hose supply for convenience. I also cut a thick foam insulation panel and did a cutout for the exit portion so I could place it on the patio at the sliding door area! Highly recommend|Positive
Strong motor|Positive
Great little swamp cooler, perfect for our hot, high desert summer. I particularly like the ice compartment, which helps out on the really hot days.|Positive
I was expecting this unit to really cool down the room. It's just, ok.|Negative
Good for small spaces. Love all of the features!|Positive
Had a problem with an internet company I purchased through, my Customer Service rep Vincent with NewAir was awesome and took care of my problem right away. When I need something for my house or my work I will go through this company because of how he took care of the situation and made his company my place to shop. Thank you Vincent.|Positive
Even if you put cold water and ice. You barely get a cool breeze. Not worth the $40 price.|Negative
"These are not 40"" wide like they claim. Measures 39"" right out of the box. This leaves you with a 1"" gap for air to get by. The styrofoam that they include must be a filler? Also is flimsy and is not good for a filler at all since it just breaks easily. Not recommended."|Negative
This cooler will help in the desert heat. It moves plenty of air, especially on high. Our garage is uninsulated so it gets quite hot in the summer, and this will help when I have work to do there. My little 8X8 shop is attached to the garage, and this is a bit big for just that room, so I'll have to set it back a ways. I put it on the back porch to see how it works there. Ambient temp was 86. Relative humidity was 20%. Like any evaporative cooler the pads had to get good and wet before we saw much change in temp. Discharge air got down to 66, a 20 degree drop. No difference in temp drop with high or low. speed. Not too bad, though I get close to 30 degree drop through the cooler on the house. Of course when the summer rains come, and humidity goes up, the efficiency will drop considerably., and high speed may help a bit. We like the ability to adjust the louvers up and down, and the SWING feature is nice. Not sure yet, how long the 3 gallon sump will take to use before refilling. Knowing my wonderful wife of 45 years, I strongly believe that I'll need to get another (smaller) cooler for my shop because this one will very likely wind up on the porch all summer. Now for the downside. Cord could be longer to allow for better placement without creating a tripping hazard. Though the instructions say not to use an extension cord, for us it will be a necessity. The drain plug is hard to get to. as there is very little space above the floor (see pics below) . Getting it out is tight but OK, but putting it back requires tilting the cooler. My finger would not go under it to get the plug back in. Overall, a nice, attractive cooler.|Positive
the float is made of brass and was easy to replace|Positive
This cover fit perfect. It's funny that I bought the evaporative cooler from home depot and yet had to special order the cover because they don't keep it in stock. It works just like it should.|Positive
Needs more supports for corners !!!!|Positive
Cold air 40% working good happens|Positive
Very cool|Positive
Way better than the one that came with the cooler. Easy to adjust.|Positive
"I like this cooler over others by comparison for my ""efficient Cooling"" purpose, since I live in a desert area."|Negative
The Honeywell model 1062 CFM 2-Speed Portable Cooler is not a compressor or air conditioner. It is an Evaporative Cooler which I suggest, is best applied in outdoor settings. It is basically an elaborate misting cooler that requires a constant flow of water, via a hose connection. This is not a product for humid climates and also not a great idea to have a hose running through your home. I am really not sure about this item,. It does what it says so I will not dock stars or neg it but it's purpose is not evident to me.|Positive
Appears to be a cheaper and perhaps good Chinese replacement for the real CELdek. Only time will tell if as long-lived.|Negative
This was the third pump in 3 years. The last one lasted exactly a year. I hope for a little more from this one. When they're working they do a very good job.|Positive
Very quiet and efficient|Positive
This is day one and they are working to cool the bedrooms. The only problem I had was a dead battery for the remote control. I will need to replace it.|Positive
"Shipment packaging isn't sturdy. Enhances opportunity for shipping damage and reduces opportunity for convenient return/exchange. My unit's fan control is defective. Low is high and high is low. Advertising and instructions imply that ice can be added through the upper water/ice tray, but this isn't reasonably accurate. First, there is no ""upper tray"". There is only one opening on the back and its towards the bottom of the unit. And you can't reasonably expect to add ice through it. The water tray has a screen that prevents ice of any normal size from entering the unit. You can, of course, add cold water. But no ice. So saying you can, and calling the water tray and ""ice and water"" tray is patently miss-leading. Shame on you. On the bright side, my call in to customer support was a good experience. Really nice people who are well trained and solution oriented."|Negative
It does an excellent job. Pleased with cooling effect. Easy to move when coasters are attached Cons: 1. Requires to be refilled when run on high after 2-3 hrs. 2. Float indicator does not go all the way to blue. If not careful, you wind up with overflow on the floor during use.|Positive
great|Positive
"Loved the product so far. It did bring down the temp in my garage and my cat thanks you. Would have given it a 5 but the switch is set up backwards (as another reviewer wrote), and I was unable to get the casters in. Got two in and couldn't get the back two in using all my might. Then I couldn't get the front 2 out so I had to put a block under the back to check it out. Then I couldn't tip it over when I asked my male neighbor if he could get them in. So I had to run it till the water was used up but it doesn't use up 100%, so I had to tip it on its side and let the remaining water out. It took my ""male"" neighbor some grunts and a rubber mallet to get them in. Perhaps there could be an easier way?"|Positive
Just had it put on. seems to be doing the job. Fit well.|Positive
"Perfect evaporative cooler. I use it only as a personal fan and cooler. I don't use it to cool a room, I just use it in the garage about 8 ft. in front of me and it works great in keeping me comfortable. It is well made and well engineered. Read the instructions thoroughly. You do not need to activate the cooling function if you do not want to. Sometimes just the fan, with the ""cyclone effect"" is fine to keep me cool. The unit comes with reusable ice packs, and a remote. I am going to buy another unit very soon. I figure if one is good, two should be better !!"|Positive
I ordered this particular cooler cover to protect my new outside air conditioning unit from the winter snow and cold of the east coast here in NYC. We have particularly long and harsh winters here. . The size of this cooler cover is generous and the company gave many options in sizes. The material is not a heavy canvas but heavy enough to make me comfortable that when the blustery wind and snow come, my unit will be insulated and protected from moisture including rain, dust, and snow. The material is light weight and has a tie for closer that I did not feel would be adequate to use alone. I reinforced the cover with a strap placed at the bottom of the unit to make sure it would not blow off from the strong gusts of winds, I recommend using a straps or bungee cords to anyone who would be considering purchasing this cover regardless of the size of your unit as it could blow off. I would purchase again and would recommend to a friend or neighbor. The delivery was prompt and the cost was reasonable and I feel that with the bungee cord I got at the Dollar store, I can face the coming winter with confidence.|Positive
Very easy to install. Look nice and professional on top of house. Seems to have saved Heating cost by about 1/3rd|Positive
I use it for my master cool window unit . Pump gave out and this one replaces it|Positive
I love our new cooler! Having a remote control for this unit is really nice. We are able to set the timer, I think that is the coolest feature of the unit, besides it being tall and lightweight.|Positive
This cooler is a better design, the whole thing can be taken apart. The whole unit is screwed together instead of welded or riveted. Makes it easier to replace parts. It also has a plastic liner all around the wet area.|Positive
good fit|Positive
fits great and works great|Positive
"If you have to replace a water pump that doesn't have enough power to begin with to cool down your Evap A/C thats a 2000sg ft. unit then this 15000 Gpm is the BEST unit to buy and if the A/C is a Master Cool type then you would and will be very Happy you bought this Pump I also recommend you use new clamps and replace the hose most sizes are 38 Length X ID 3/4 X OD 1"" and also flush out the water spreader by just removing the end cap and run the pump it's best to have another person to activate the switch for you when your up on the roof and after you see a good flow of clean water then button it all up and check float height to keep the correct water level with the use of this high volume pump even if there is a slight over flow at the top of the over flow tube. It may take about 30 mins before you notice how cool it becomes in your home. I also recommend that if you have hard water build up in your A/C unit then buy a 4 pk of Portacool or other brands of hard water treatment strips and be sure you wear gloves to handle these items and put 2 strips before season starts or if you just had any work done by yourself then add them and use these for the next season also. Best of Luck I hope my information helps those who wonder about this Great Water A/C Pump. P.S Stay Safe use proper safety gear at all times."|Positive
Simple, straightforward controls and very effective in cooling. No electronic controls to break. Perfect!!!|Positive
It good|Positive
just what I was looking for.|Positive
I actually used this for my boat lift. It was less expensive and of good quality. It works great.|Positive
Used to be a good product. But now quality has changed. Very bad! House was warm and muggy. Bought the blue pads and now house is nice and cool again.|Negative
This fan cools great on the outdoor porch without the cooling on. The fan is terrific in itself.|Positive
I live in a very small apt. and didnt know that you had to have a window or door opened and another opened at the other end. In 100° weather my apt was still 87°. Went through 3 bags of ice and that certainly wasn't helping.|Negative
Easy to install, and a good price for this product.|Positive
This is a very economical item to have, especially in southern Arizona in the summer!!!! It is less expensive to operate than an air conditioner, and works so much better in our home!!!!|Positive
The unit came complete except the casters needed to be put on. Not a problem, as that way they don’t break during shipping. The unit works great. I have it setup at the front of my shop with a hose attached and it cools down the area very well. Make sure to open a window, since it is evaporative.|Positive
It would have been a good value had the drain plug not snapped off when I tried to tighten it, as it was dripping all over the floor. Now I'm trying to figure out how to take apart the top tank and literally cork the drain plug so I can get it up and running. And that process itself sounds like it's own share of brain damage, according to other reviews. l'd think that the manufacturer would have realized NOT to use poor materials such as a plastic drain plug, which likely wore from mineral deposits. This is only the 2nd season I've had it, and it's been run a total of 20-30 times. This makes it a horrible value.|Negative
I bought 2, one for me and one for my son, then my husband wanted one, then I posted about it and my friend and my sister both went out and got one. For extra chill put the filter in the freezer. Today I even put ice cubes in the tank!|Positive
I love that this fan is very powerful and has so many options in terms of strength, air flow and temperature. It is the first and only humidifier I have ever tried that doesn't add too much moisture in the air. With this one I don't have to worry about it ruining my furniture or carpet. It adds just the right about of moisture in the air to cool it down.|Positive
The canvas was not as heavy as the last ones we bought through Lowes. The draw strings were light and even though they were sealed in plastic, they were dusty.|Negative
Super easy to install|Positive
Clean and simple. Great fan ...aand an amazing amount of coverage. Nice easy remote. I live north of Palm Springs in the dry So California desert...were humidity can be as low as 5%. So works great here...aand wonderful as a cooler- humidifier . small 1000 sf desert cottage...We can keep it cool in living room areas even when it's 90's outside with no AC on. Would be great tho if it had an auxiliary water tank to extend the cool time from 3 to 4 hrs per tank to 6 to 8. I am thinking of designing one. Yes am also thinking of buying another.|Positive
This cooler is junk, its loud,hard to change the filters,and home depot refused to do any thing because I was 14 days past thier 90 day return policy. does not cool small squirrel cage. Do not buy you will regret it!!!!!!|Negative
Does not push out much cold air, could have just bought. Fan and it would have done the same as this|Negative
It works fine.|Positive
The float valve was top quality and met all my standards. If I ever need a product like this I will defiantly be back..|Positive
Shipping came early. Easy assembly and has worked great in the shop I'm in. I run a constant water supply to it as it will drain the reservoir quickly. Love it.|Positive
I had no problem, everything went well.|Positive
Excellent pump, great price. We have a 1300sq. ft house and this pump provides more than enough water to keep the house cool. The previous pump was also a Dial and lasted almost 4 summers.|Positive
Awesome swamp cooler|Positive
Fit perfectly and saved the time of cutting the blue ones to fit|Positive
"Have had mine for 8 yrs now. Only replaced pump, and float. Pads go for 2 yrs, I have a ""dump pump"" on mine also, it empties water every 8 hours of running time. I like this better than the little 1/4"" line that just is supposed to drip to keep the water fresh. they always seem to need adjustment. I have also ""McGyvered"" a thermostat on mine, using a on/off switch and a commercial thermo. HD has a thermo you can buy, but getting a wire from one end of the house to my cooler was going to be hard, so did it this way. So now instead of having to get up in the middle of the night, it does its thing. We also like having the doors open in the summer, (with security door locked). Have 3 upducts in various rooms when the doors arent open. Humidity over 15-20 %, and it doesnt' work so well. Motor on high speed doesnt seem to cool any better, but a little more air flow. I once filled the kitchen full of smoke while burning a pan up on the stove, and the cooler did a great job of clearing the house. My neighbor asked if my house was on fire after seeing all the smoke coming out of the patio door, I told her I was just cooking. Love the cooler, and the small elec bills in the summer."|Positive
Works extremely well|Positive
BOUGHT TWO SO I WOULD HAVE A BACKUP. FIRST ONE FROZE UP WITHIN TEN DAYS. SECOND ONE IS STILL GOING THREE WEEKS LATER. (KNOCK ON WOOD). WARRANTY IS VOID IF UNIT FAILURE IS CAUSED BY WATER DAMAGE. HAVE THEY EVER LOOKED INSIDE A SWAMP COOLER?|Negative
Purchased two of these coolers to replace old coolers that were rusted hulks. Coolers arrived on pallets with adequate packaging for protection. Had to disassemble them to move and then install them in their permanent location along the side of our home. Easy enough since they were assembled with bolts / machine screws. Disappointed to find the cooler case components are pretty flimsy. Soft steel and bend / dent easily. Also, I assumed that when the coolers arrived from the manufacturer, they would be finished and final inspected since, in most cases, I wouldn't think they would be disassembled before permanently installed. In my case, I was disappointed to find loose fasteners, nuts with attached star washers that were installed backwards, and apparently random use of different types of machine screws. All of this gave me the impression of poor quality, hasty factory assembly, and lack of any real final inspection. In short, I'm not sure where these coolers are made or assembled, but I hope not in America. I would be ashamed if they were. I fixed the issues I discovered with the coolers when I reassembled them, but now wonder if the same poor quality / inspection might be manifested in their design, choice of steel, or protective finishes. I am fundamentally concerned over how long they will last.|Negative
This unit is ok, but wished I had got the larger one.I do give this one gets 4 star.|Positive
What a steel! I had previously got one from Amazon in April for the regular price which by the time it was delivered came to $300.Concept keep it light... keep it sturdy... keep it simple. I have always loved water coolers where the climate allows them to be useful. I also own the Cylone 2200 water cooler. Hessaire came out with a good idea. The more air the unit receives the better it will deliver. When you first get the unit make sure you learn how to maintenance them. Open them up vacuum them out check all the moving parts. During the sale I bought 2 of the tall 1,000's for $192 each. Put those in the bedrooms up against the opened screen window and wahla I sleep like a King. Why do I prefer this brand because they work. One day I called the company in Alabama 7:30 pm their time and this nice lady answered the phone. I was asking if they were going to stock parts at Home Depot. She assured me they would since it was a new account for them. She said normally she would have gone home but was their late filling up out of stock orders to be available online. Great Company. Yeah I know 95% of what we buy is from China.......ZAIJIAN !!!!!!!!!!|Positive
Heavy canvas with drawstring bottom. We no longer use our swamp coolers so these stay on year-round and hold up very well. Lasts about 3 years through all (Colorado) weather conditions - hard to ask for more.|Positive
Works great for our large patio, our humidity is usually low (Arizona) it will bring the temperature down by 10 degrees almost immediately. Better than we expected!|Positive
I thought the air coming out even with the ice put in it would be cooler. It is an ok buy and I will keep it but I would not recommend it to keep you cool.|Negative
warranty sucks had for 2 months high speed went out homedepo won,t repair they want me to hire someone to fix unit factory just as bad i would not recomend this unit|Negative
It doesn't cool down a room much. Even with ice and it blowing directly on me, it doesn't completely cool me. It is very loud and it has a high pitch frequency that wakes me up and forces me to turn it off, so then I get even hotter. Also there is water that doesn't get evaporated and the only way to empty it is to turn the entire fan upside down and pour it out|Negative
Not to much to say about it other than it works for its intended purpose. Im not sure i would run it while the cover is on even though it looks like you can but i will be using for after winterization when not running the unit. I see it lasting a few seasons. About the same quality as a cheap BBQ grill cover. The size is as advertised. Great way to protect you Evap. cooler.|Negative
Hooked it up and worked great for 3 days then stopped working.|Negative
I wiould give it 5 starts if the slats were adjustable to point up. Since item is to provide humidity in a dry environment , it does the job great but no air can be pointed up when in fan mode.|Positive
Very happy with the cooling capability of this unit. Cools the whole 1600 sq ft house. On a 105F day it stayed 68F in the living room and 72F throughout the house. Only 2 objections to this unit. The evaporative medium is treated straw. Would prefer the newer fiber material that is in use now and with sheet metal construction I suspect I will have to put in some larger screws eventually as they easily strip out. Other than that it's a great unit and if you are handy with tools I would recommend this unit.|Positive
The product appeared to be of very good quality. I mistakingly ordered the wrong size and had to reorder.|Positive
Fit perfectly. It's been on the cooler about 2 weeks and storms are just starting. Cannot comment on durability at this time.|Negative
Would not cool 100 sq. ft. bedroom. The instructions said to place under a window. The only window in my bedroom is above the bed headboard. Short of balancing it on a pillow, this was not possible. Wish they told me this prior to purchase.|Negative
a real good fit and very good price.|Positive
This was for a rental. We rented and the former tenant had three pumps sitting in the bottom of the cooler, none of them specifically for the Bonaire Durango Cooler. The pad was crumbling with calcium deposits, three floats in the unit and none worked and a hookup to the faucet that was clogged. Water calcium marks ran down the front of the house. We were so glad to find out Home Depot actually carried the pump that fit into the unit. We replaced all parts at Home Depot and it works great. We also took a paint sample to Home Depot and painted over the horrible white hard water stains. No more overflowing or any problems. I just wish my landlord would have paid for it. 108* weather, but air conditioning not considered necessary. Really?|Positive
Ok|Positive
I live in Colorado and the air is dry. If you live east of Topeka Kansas do not buy this. If you live in a dry climate you need to understand that these work on air flow. I have a 10×10 room that I needed to cool. This unit on low fan and low water flow turned a 98 degree day into a 80 degree day. The key is exhaust. You need to evacuate the humid air as fast as you put it in. Box fan in the window is a smart move. I work on diesel engines so I understand air flow.|Positive
I really like this evaporative cooler. It helped to cool off my 3rd floor bedroom in my town-home. The summers are just unbearably hot up there (90 degrees), fans weren't cutting it and an A/C unit wasn't an option. I use it at night 5 days a week (and all day Sat/Sun) I fill it up in the afternoon after work and it usually lasts until I wake up in the morning. A couple of tips: * Keep it by an open window (this helps a ton!) * When you want to refill, turn the power off and wait a few minutes for the pump to move. If you power it off and pull out the tank immediately, the pump will still be in the way. *Keep in mind that this isn't an air conditioner, it works differently. If you expect an A/C unit you're going to be disappointed.|Positive
I am very pleased with the performance of my new evaporative cooler. I prefer the evaporative cooler rather than using my air conditioner because the cost of running the evaporative cooler is much less than the cost of using the air conditioner. Also, the air has more moisture in it and there is a complete air exchange every four minutes. No stale air in the house . Opening select windows and doors to the desired opening governs the entry and passage of fresh, cool air. I had an old evaporative cooler that finally quit working just after I purchased my new Champion RWC50, which was in transit for a few days after the old one quit. Using the air conditioner for even a few days made me more appreciative of my new cooler. The fan has two speeds and can be operated completely with a remote control. It is a window unit and the water line hookup was easy to accomplish with a separately purchased kit. Another great feature of this cooler is it was made in the U.S.A.|Positive
I had this cooler with less than 30 hours of operation and the fan motor went out. I called the manufacturer and they told me that you couldn't replace the fan motor. I wasted $233.00 on this piece of junk!!!|Negative
Yes it beautifully meets my expectations.. and I haven't turned on my very expensive central air since it arrived|Positive
I bought this to cool a very small sun room that I use as a home office. The room is about 8x15' - so not too big. The issue with my particular unit is easy to explain. The method for distributing the water into the filter/difuser is completely inadequate. The water doesn't distribute effectively and thus isn't evaporated it just runs back down into the collection basin. So, really this is just a big loud fan with no evaporative properties. And you can buy a fan for much less money. IMPORTANT - I've noted that some reviewers have any issues and, in fact, love their products. To me, this means there must be quality control issues; some product go out the door perfect, others go out like, well, mine. So beware before you buy and, if you buy, SAVE THE BOX AND ALL THE PAPERWORK so you can return it. I foolishly did not save it so this is just 300 bucks up in smoke.|Negative
I have just installed this unit over the weekend. I had ordered it online and had it delivered to my rental in Placerville, Ca. (HOT and dry during the summer months). The installation was a breeze, but... I was replacing an existing evap. cooler so the plastic water supply tubing and suspension chain was already in place. (If this is a fresh install for you, plan on buying and installing enough of the plastic water supply tubing to reach from your water source to the unit. The unit comes with a bag containing suspension chain, hooks (for anchoring to wood) , a float and drain tube, and two metal rods for spacing the bottom of the unit away from the house.. Also includes some plastic side panels but plan on making a custom one for the sealing if the installed cooler. Hoisting it up to the window would be doable (but awkward) with one strong guy and a jack, but... talk a friend into helping you hoist it up. Literally, just hoist it in place, connect the support chains, position the spacer rods on the bottom of the unit, and the hard work is all done... (takes about 5 minutes if you had already mounted the chains to the wall). The power plug is the standard 3-prong 110V type, so make sure there is a outlet close to the installed unit that you can plug it in to... Soooo.... I'll post again about its cooling ability for the 1200sqft house when I get feedback from the tenant. For now I'm pretty pleased with the unit....|Positive
It works great, however, the water gauge seems to not be as efficient as it should be....you can hear the pump trying to pull water even when the gauge says it's still half full.|Positive
Very quiet. Excellent.|Positive
Meets My Needs Perfectly|Positive
Easy to use, albeit a little too noise to run through the night in the highest setting. Use it primarily before we go to bed to cool down the room and it does a truly great job at it! We are saving a BUNDLE compared with traditional air conditioning and I highly recommend it for use in dry climates.|Positive
fits like a glove works perfect|Positive
Did not know that I would have to change 5 gallons of water every week or add ice to make it cooler. Probably a better choice for someone living in a dryer climate.|Positive
I purchased 6 Up-Dux and I am very happy. No more opening windows to vent my evaporating cooler. All I have to do now is open and close doors to direct the flow and cool the rooms I want. There is a plastic cover that slides in and out of a slot in the side of the grill to shut the unit off completely in the winter. It is very quick and easy to do. Installation directions are easy to fallow and the units are quick and easy to install. All 6 in 3 hours. Pay attention to height clearances so the flapper door can open properly. I placed one a little too close to the edge of the roof and the flapper bumps into the roof when the cooler comes on. Units can be installed without going into the attic, but I did go into the attic to be sure the insulation was in the proper place to get the the most cooling efficiency. Made In USA always a PLUS.|Positive
Runs well on low speed. On medium and high does more than just vibrate. Installed and removed same day.|Negative
We really like this Hessaire cooler, it has made a big difference during this hot summer in northern Nevada. With this big boy in the larger room and it's 800 cfm baby brother in the smaller room, we've had as much as a 30 degree differential from the outside air temp.|Positive
"This thermostat is a great improvement over the very dumb rotary switch I had been using. But, on the other hand, the new guy could itself be improved upon if it were made to be ""smart"", i.e. a truly programmable WiFi gadget. The MasterStat has a timer, which is useful, but not a scheduler."|Negative
This product does help cool down the room; however, it is very loud and it leaks water from the water tank|Negative
These straps are great and easy to use, they where big enough for me to cut some of the length off! Had some high winds and my swamp cooler is still covered tightly not like when I used bungy cords!|Positive
Use it in my bedroom. It's perfect in every way: cool, quiet, easy to move, easy to use.|Positive
Every thing working good .hopefully last for a long time. Thanks|Positive
Works very well. Fairly quiet on low speed. Output Temperature is about 70 degree on a 95 degree day.|Positive
Not really what I expected, and doesn't meet the cooling needs. I'm not able to take it back, because I threw out the box it came in already.|Negative
It didn't work at all. I bought two units and had to return them after 3 days. I live in east bay area with average humidity of 30%, but the unit was not working.|Negative
Happy that I went with this one instead of the bigger size. It works great powerful and cool. Helps in the heat we have sometimes.|Positive
This pump is working harder than ever. When it is not blazing hot outside, I actually put my cooler fan on low. This is doing a great job!|Positive
Leaked as it was cracked on back by drain pipe.|Negative
cools my shop to tolerable temperature in the hottest part of the summer|Positive
Unfortunately I have to give this Portacool 130 a big thumbs down. I had high hopes. I got the unit home and filled with water. It leaked from the rear drain area. It wasn't that the cap was not tight; the retaining nut holding the threaded drain tube was split. This unit has a plastic drain tube/nut/cover and should be heavier PVC, Marelon (from the boating trade) or even with brass like the other components. It must hold back 16 gallons of water without a drop. The fabricators cut this corner with a cheap part - poor choice. Being returned. The salesman said these are not being re-stocked. I understand why now.|Negative
good price, very easy installation|Positive
"This is not ""AC"" is does not cool like ""AC"" it is an ""EVAPORATIVE"" cooler for a small area 175 Sq. Ft. don't expect it to freeze you out or blow like a tornado and you won't be disappointed. I have been trying to reduce my overall power consumption in my home so this summer I figured instead of having to run the AC on the 85-95 degree days that are just kind of uncomfortable I would only run the AC on the unbearable 100+ degree days and look for an alternate cooling source to help save on PG&E I did a lot of research on ceiling fans, tower fans, high velocity fans and other portable evap coolers but I kept coming back to this unit it meet all of my requirements. 1. It had everything I wanted for under $200 2. it does not state anywhere the power consumption of this unit it only states that it uses 0.5 amps so 120 volts X .5 amps = 60 watts power consumption when I got it home I tested it with a kill a watt meter and on high cool with swing turned on it was actually only using 57.5 watts that's excellent 3. it has a removable rear water drawer that holds 3 gallons of water and there is a front facing water level indicator, a lot of similar coolers had smaller water tanks than this and had small filler openings. it also has a low water alarm. 4. it has a small upper water chamber that houses the water flow control valve so you can back off the humidity if need be you can also add ice to this area to increase cooling this is a feature I did not see on any other units in this price range. 5. it has an oscillating feature called ""swing"" which can be turned off or on it also has adjustable up or down louvers 6. it has a timer and a remote control with a storage spot on top for the remote 7. 3 speed fan that puts out a reasonable amount of air, could be a little stronger but power consumption would go up so I was fine with that. 8. it's on wheels with 2 locking casters easily take it from room to room 9. lightweight but sturdy 10. does not look ugly You get a lot for what you pay for this unit and I have no problem recommending it just don't expect an arctic blast of 100 MPH and you won't be disappointed."|Positive
Fit and work perfectly. I would definitely recommend them|Positive
This is helpful but it's as big as a washing machine! Easy to fill and really helps to move the air around and cool it down.|Positive
Exactly what I needed and price was MUCH lower than other suppliers.|Positive
This motor cools off the house fast even when the temp outside is in the 90s|Positive
Quality heavy canvas material. Expect it to weather well in harsh high desert climate with snow, ice, and high winds. Slightly large to fit easily over the cooler.|Positive
Have had two units for approximately one month. Both units are now leaking. The leaking is NOT due to overfilling tank.|Negative
Great product, wish I'd got one years ago. I can now enjoy my patio even when it's 100 degrees outside. Without breaking a sweat !!|Positive
But as all swamps go the water will get passed the paint and we all know what happens then RUST|Positive
"These fit my 16.5"" diameter wind turbines like a charm. I hope these last 20 years like my last ones."|Positive
very helpful it works in places you cant get air conditioning|Positive
Broke after a month's use.|Negative
Really like the Luma evaporative cooler unit. It's a slim design, very quiet and seems to cool the room in a nice manner .|Positive
This cover fit perfectly and is easy snap on and off. Works great for blocking out cold and wind drafts. Highly recommend it for your evap cooler winterization.|Positive
Assembly was awesome, there is none, just pull it out of the box. It is very quiet, but it doesn't cool much and the water runs out in about 4 hours, so I can't leave it running while I am at work. Also, the casters don't roll well on carpet.|Negative
This item is a good replacement. With a bit of trimming on the length only, this cooler filter replacement fits the Kuulaire Port-a-cool model KA 45 perfectly.|Positive
I haven’t used yet, this cover will be used to cover the cooler this winter. I have used this one before and lasted many years.|Positive
easy to install, price was excellent. my only other option locally was to buy online, and with home depot it was right in the store ready to go.|Positive
The cooler works very well, but the evaporator pad is a lot of trouble to get at and the retaining clips are difficult to remove and put back in. I need to move it a lot and the casters don't swivel very well at all. But it cools very well.|Positive
Finally a cooler made of rustproof plastic and does not require a hole in the roof! Good design with intelligence and thoughtfulness. I really like the cooler, but the instructions were incomplete, making the installation way more difficult that it should have been. I had to install it twice to learn that 3-4 inches of space is required behind the top of the cooler to assure the top of the outer case half is installed properly. Covers are supposed to be available. I could find nothing.|Positive
Didn't work any better that a fan for me.|Negative
It was shipped in a very timely manner. The manager that waited on me was very professional and was a good example of what an employee should act like. He is a real asset to Home Depot.|Positive
You have to realize that this is NOT an air conditioner, but as an evaporative cooler, it works great. I used this in a town that only occasionally gets too warm, and it does great. Using ice in the top compartment helps too.|Positive
This product works great. Very happy with product.|Positive
My 20 year old cooler died a very dramatic death. (shooting out chunks of rusty metal and grey dust one very hot night). I had nursed that old rust bucket for ten years. So it was time for a new one. It was easy removing the old cooler (just turn off the power at the panel and shut off the water supply first) Then disconnect the electrical and water at the cooler, also I removed my old motor to reuse in the new cooler and then all it took was a little twisting and the old rusty unit came right off. I was left with a bit of a problem. The old roof jack (the thing the old cooler sat on) was very badly rusted and was not going to be able to be used again. I looked around town for a replacement and found it costs $247.00!!! I went to Home depot and found the universal duct Dial Model 78317 for much less. One thing to note the Dial Universal roof jack is not built to carry the weight of the cooler so you have to buy and install the leg kit. Dial Model # 7805. I bought both for about 1/3 the price of a new custom roof jack. Also you have to bend a tab on the universal duct to connect to the Champion cooler but that was easy and it tells you how in the instructions of the universal duct. The Champion cooler was a good choice because It comes apart. I was installing the cooler alone so I took the cooler apart on the ground and was able to lift all the parts on the roof by myself and re-assemble the cooler in-place on the roof. Install the old motor, hook up the electrical and water and I was back in business. I also like that Champion has a listing of all the parts in the manual so you can order a replacement by part number. It took a couple of days to replace but the new cooler runs a lot quieter and cools the house a ton better.|Positive
the pump fit the size cooler I am using, volume of water it pumps does well when operating the cooler in the low speed. In the high side is not enough, but it still cools.|Positive
I really wanted this to work for cooling a family and kitchen room, for environmental and energy benefits. (425 sq ft with 8 ft ceilings completely enclosed.) The controls allow 3 speeds and fan direction can oscillate. At first it seemed this might do the job, once the room air flow was set up properly. As another reviewer noted with evaporative coolers, the cooled air must be exhausted from the room, otherwise the moist cooled air warms up and the room air becomes muggy. However, even with the cooler set up properly it was frustrating trying to get the room to stay cool. It constanly required cold water and ice added to the water reservoir. It did not completely cool the 425 sq ft but did fine on 250-300 sq ft. It was easy to move between rooms, so that is a plus, but was also very noisy. For what this unit does or does not do, the price is much too high.|Negative
fit perfect initial odor goes away in about 2 days|Positive
We are using the cooler on our patio and it’s made all the difference. We are Arizonans and it’s in the triple digits right now. The cooler has made it possible for us to be outdoors and not couped up in the house during the hottest time of day. We love it.|Positive
Just bought it for a backup for the future.|Positive
It didn't give off any cooling even when we added the ice. I had an old fan that did better.|Negative
Works good on our deck|Positive
Works great like in garage, or your work area.|Positive
I use this on my patio in Arizona and believe me it's hot. This machine makes summers more tolerable. It is, without a doubt, the best evaporative cooler I've ever owned and that spans almost 40 years. Quiet, won't rust, light weight, directional vanes rotate, or not. Don't know about the claims regarding power usage, but I don't care. The rest of it is great. Oh, did I mention the very reasonable price?|Positive
nice heavy materia/fit was perfect/grate value for the quality.|Positive
Very happy with this cooler. The pads arent the best but I can change them next year.|Positive
GREAT FOR THE SHOP. COOLS WELL WITH 8% DESERT HUMIDITY; DRIPS A LITTLE.|Positive
After many years of service I had to replace the Emerson S63NXJRP-7847 motor. This Dial motor is supposed to be a direct replacement and physically it was. However, even without a load on the motor it is very noisy. With the proper load it is even worse. I doubt that I will use the cooler much because of the extreme noise. I would not recommend this motor to anyone.|Negative
This was exactly what we needed. We replaced an old one that was carodid.|Positive
Lightweight and quiet|Positive
The canvas looks like it will be durable, however because there are no holes for the chain attachments for the unit, you have to cut holes in the canvas which degrades the integrity of the cover. There could have been grommets installed to facilitate the installation. The line supplied to hold the cover in place is whimpy. Without additional attachments, the cover would be gone in a few days.|Positive
exact fit does a good cooling job|Positive
Saving part for emergency backup. These sale out fast.|Positive
Placed in a 16x16 sunroom, this unit did not perform well. When using plain water, the temperature was lowered less than 6-8 degrees F, and when using the frozen packs, not much better. The sunroom windows had to be left open or the humidity in the room would become excessive, but doing so allowed the hot, dry air to enter and compete with the unit's cooling effect. Also, when the unit was turned off, the pump continued to run, and had to be unplugged. This was a quality defect that caused me to return the unit.|Negative
Cools garage nicely.|Positive
The swamp cooler works great, but when we got it home it had a dent in the top of the outer shell that I was not happy about. I didn't have time to take it back for another one, so I just went ahead and installed it with the dent.|Positive
The float had a generic enough application that it fit my application nicely. The parts were easy to use and it worked right out of the box.|Positive
"After returning a portable unit a few days ago that didn't do the job, I paid a bit more and got this unit. It didn't take long to have it up and running and has worked great! Even in 110 degree heat, it's keeping a 12' x 22' room very comfortable. It cools off the room so well that once the sun goes down, I have to put it on the ""low cool"" setting, then at bed time, I shut it off. By morning, the room is slightly warm, but once I turn it on, it's back to cool again in no time. Seriously, don't waste your time with one of the portable units. Invest in one of these or a larger window unit and you'll be able to deal with the dry heat waves in comfort. Just remember - you get what you pay for!"|Positive
Good for this summer time|Positive
works great in the garage when working and on the back porch when relaxing|Positive
We have had our cooler for three years and it does a great job cooling our 1800 SF New Mexico home. However, when it comes time to replace the pads there's a problem. Nobody but the manufacturer carries the pads or replacement parts. The tabs that hold the large pad are part of the unit and break easily, no replacement available. The tabs that hold the smaller side tabs are replaceable for $9 for a set of 8 but they are easy to take off without breaking. The pads are expensive enough at $120.00 but the deal breaker is the shipping cost, simply outrageous. You're better off buying a whole new unit from a company where you can buy the pads locally.|Negative
Works well, powerful, cools whole house incl 2nd floor in minutes!|Positive
I picked this up at the store and the people who helped me with my web purchase were fantastic! Then, my electrician installed this and it worked right away. It hasn't been cool enough yet for it to shut off automagically, but I am confident. It didn't fit quite right into the old 6-position switch box, but that part of the wall will be redone shortly so that's not a problem for me. Others might want to look at changing the housing . . . Also, read the instructions about when the unit will shut itself off based on the temperature. It has to be 3 degrees lower than the set point to shut off. :-) But I love this thing. I find myself checking the little green light and feeling confident when I see that it's on.|Positive
Great item. Perfect fit. Easy installation. A little pricey but should last a couple seasons.|Positive
A glorified expensive fan - even with ice & chilled water - Don't make my mistake!!!|Negative
This is just the right size for our need. Mostly want it for when we sit outside in the summer Also I craft in the garage and it gets really hot in there.|Positive
After using black heavy duty trash bags for several years I found the perfect Turbine Vent Cover. It exceeded my expectations and the quality of the product is very durable and is resistant to the weather it is made for. Very satisfied and highly recommended. Thanks to a online representative that helped me find this product that can only be ordered online at homedepot.com. Purchased two for two vents that I have.|Positive
The a/c made the whole room hot and humid. You HAVE to sit directly in front of it to feel the breeze no matter what speed it's on. I returned it after a week.|Negative
this product is the worst. if I knew it was 6 inches tall I wouldn't have bought it. 45 square feet, more like 4-5 square inches. I returned it immediatly|Negative
It is nice and works perfect!! Easy to use and you can use water line or pitcher to fill!|Positive
This is a decent product yet it would be great one if they would have included a brass fitting that attaches to the threaded part of the water float switch. That part which makes it considerably easier to a attach to a water source is extremely hard to find to locate. I stumbled across a float switch which had the required brass fitting, which I then removed to use on the float included with the machine. I wasted a lot of time (repeatedly shopping hardware stores) and finally paid a hefty price...over $20.00 for a float kit (plus other parts that failed to work as a work around to this one missing part) when the makers of this cooler should have included a 4 or 5 dollar part that is necessary for proper use of this machine.|Negative
I must say the customer service I received on 11/25/2015 was superb! I received my Luma Comfort EC110S Evaporative Cooler and to my disappointment the right wheel was broken at the bottom of the box. I called customer service right away and the representative was extremely helpful. After I explained the situation she emailed a new label to ship the defective item back to the store and mailed another Luma Comfort out just like that! I can honestly say it was one of the most pleasant customer service calls I ever experienced.|Positive
Good quality, great price and quick delivery!|Positive
light weight and durable, easy to install, cooler runs quiet now|Positive
Great product. Temp outside is 98 house is at 76. I have used Master Cools for many years now. Have 1 at each end of house for when temp hits 118 outside. Just check the squirrel cage sides mine was missing to bolts which i used sheet metal screws asw you cant get behind cage to install bolts & nuts. Works fine.|Positive
The Universal Fit Duct Insulator is just what we needed to prevent cold winter drafts from coming into the house through the evaporative cooler vent this season. It was reasonably priced and easy to install. Definitely better than the old piece of insulation that we had used in previous years!|Positive
I first bought this product and rated it a 1 Star because I was using it in my garage and instead of cooling it, it made it extremely hot and muggy; Even with water and proper air flow. The Hessaire team quickly reached out to me to resolve the issue and sent me their new model of the one I had purchased to try out. I LOVE it!!! It works better than I could have hoped for and keeps my garage nice and cool. Happy with the product and even more so the customer service!|Positive
Easy install and good working belt, last one lasted 3 years!|Positive
Was easy to install. No problems worked very well. Easy to adjust.|Positive
It overheats and stops working|Negative
Just what I needed to cover a swamp cooler on top of roof. Would order again if needed. Thank You|Positive
Best bang for your buck and definitely helping to combat these triple digit Texas summer days.|Positive
I like your site did not require me to create an account or password. The process was quick and easy. The cooler works wonderfully.|Positive
the covers are canvas and are think and easy to install just put over vents and use tie sting to secure them ,i also added a bungee cord just to ake sure they stay in place and their a fair price|Positive
So far so good with this product. It hasn't been too hot where I live just yet but anytime I need to cool the room down it does the trick. Adding ice to the tray just makes it better. I would recommend this to anyone and plan on buying another for other rooms.|Positive
I bought 5 of these all together to install so we did not need to leave windows open to run the swamp cooler. I deviated from the instructions to make a more stable install over time by making a wooden frame to screw to the ceiling joists so the weight was not on the drywall but on the joists. The extended height Up-Dux comes in two parts with some stiffening bars for the joint. I used painters tape to hold these in position until I could screw the screws in. With two people we were able to instal each in about 1 1/2 hours. I used a manometer to check whether the house was being pressurized due to inadequate attic venting. This was not the case in our house so no soffit vents were needed to facilitate the venting. The Pros to these are the fact that you can run the cooler without leaving windows open so it can run when you are not home. We appear to have less dirt infiltrating the home because the windows are not open and the dirt does not get blown in when the cooler is off. We do not have to bypass any of the alarm zones at night when going to bed and setting the security system. The Cons to these are that the metal is of a very light gauge metal (if the metal was heavier I would have given 5 stars) and can be bent out of shape fairly easily. The blocking plates for the winter are also light weight plastic. ( These might need to be changed to metal after a few years.) Overall I would definitely recommend these for the convenience of use of the swamp cooler. The longer they are in the more we think we should have done this earlier.|Positive
First float valve broke when I had to bend the brass bar to adjust to water level in unit. The first one was brand new. Be gentle, the metal is not the highest quality. Other float valve replacements don't work with the Bonaire unit due to sizing.|Negative
no good,hot as can be in the house,never again|Negative
Every thing was as advertised|Positive
The pump did not fit. It was returned. I had to purchase a different pump.|Negative
It runs well. No coasters were included in the cooler, though|Positive
The cooler works very well but the packaging was not cool. The box appeared fine but when I pulled it out it had a lot of sheet metal damage. I did not return it because I had driven 200 miles to get it, so I just repaired it myself and installed it. Works fantastic for our 1600 modular home in the high desert. We often have to turn it down on hot days, and it's much quieter than the one that it replaced|Positive
Very easy to install.|Positive
It really worked on my air conditioner and kept it strapped|Positive
Works great as temperature gets warmer both in my shop and on the patio.|Positive
Great Cooler. Everything in the description is met.|Positive
This filter was easy to replace and it works great.|Positive
Very effective cooling. We have it on our patio & it allows us to sit outside in 100* weather very comfortably.|Positive
It's great dose the job love it it's just that my first one went out a week after I get another one I'm having problems with it the water pump works off and on so I'm just waiting for a cool down so I can send it back and go for a third one other than|Positive
Everything fine....|Positive
The brisa coolers seem to be well made. Made better than other brands and look nice. I have 5 of them, but I haven't had a chance to use them yet . If I can edit this post at a later date, after installation to tell performance I will. Great so far.|Positive
I've had to replace this 3 times in one year. It's a piece of junk but the only thing available at HD.|Negative
With my central A/C out this was a true saver. Temperatures outside have been about 95-105 degrees, and this definitely cooled us off. It didn't cool the entire house, but a large area in the living room and us directly.|Positive
I live in South East Texas and bought air cooler 4 years ago. Replacing old one. Runs all day long. I put ice in the main unit and use ice chest blue blocks in the top for extra cooling. Our summer get close to 100 degrees outside.|Positive
Decent pump lasts about a year and a half. Noticeable differenceonce we changed pumps|Positive
The unit does keep the living room cool even with the windows open. It is a bit loud, but I can live with it. I can run the fan on the level 1 setting and the tank lasts about 9.5 hours. I don't keep it connected to a continual source of water, I just fill it up when it's running low. No alarm lets you know, you just have to keep your eye on the water level on the front. It's easy to fill with the opening being on the top of the unit. Although it has the honey comb panels on the side, cool air only comes out in the front, which is fine. Nothing beats central AC but this is the best next thing if you want to keep electricity costs down. It does have a plug on the bottom near the back to drain the water if you're going to store the unit. Make sure that's sealed tight before you start filling the unit with water.|Positive
The good: blows a lot of cool air. We live in Oakland (SF Bay Area) so there's some ocean humidity, but we put the Honeywell in front of an open sliding glass door and it really cools an area 20 feet deep and 10-12 feet wide. I aim it at my easy chair and it keeps me cool with the fan on low. It's the quietest evap. cooler that advertises it's noise level (which doesn't mean it's the quietest; who knows?), but it's not quiet. My wife can't stand the noise. The bad: poorly designed. The fill opening is a flimsy flap that falls open; unless you pour very slowly water splashes off the flap and wets the floor. The water basin detaches far easy filling, BUT the main unit has a spring loaded.hose dangling from the bottom, so it drips lots of water and you have to lay it on its side or break the flimsy hose mechanism. The latches that hold the basin on fall into the closed position, so it takes two people or one strong contortionist to put the basin back on. The indifferent: it's shipped with inadequate packaging. Ours arrived damaged and was obvious how it happened.|Negative
I received a NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are 100% my own.If you know anything about AZ heat, you know we reach triple digit temps from end of May until beginning of September. It takes a toll on our air conditioning and our electricity bill.Fortunately, the NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler has been helping keep our house cool using water and electricity.The light weight, portable (it has wheels) NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler is easy to move from our living area where we use it to cool the evening and back to our room where it keeps us cool at night.Even without water, the NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler still works as a fan so it really is a great addition to our home!|Positive
Pads are easy to install and arrived in a timely manner.|Positive
"I rated the cooler low because of the cleaning instruction and difficulty of cleaning. The instruction for cleaning state, ""Please change water often to keep the water tank clean. It is recommended to change the water once every 1-2 days"". I have used the cooler 2 days and right now I'm changing the water. Here's the deal. You have to remove 2 screws on the back panel. Removing the panel wasn't easy..I thought I was going to break the plastic trying to get it off. After getting the back panel off I had to remove the filter, another screw to remove and the filter was a little hard to remove without crushing the edges. Once I removed the filter...once inside the unit their was no 'water tank' to take out and clean. The water sits in the bottom of the unit. I had to take a cup and scoop out the water and to remove the last bit of water I will have to pick up the unit, 25lbs, and tip it to dump it in the sink. The is a poor design. I expected to take out a container not to have to scoop out the water. To have to do this every other day is unreasonable and would be a big Pain and time consuming. Right now I am not sure how easy it will be to put the filter back into the unit. The instruction also say that when not in use to drain water, clean unit and store in a cool dry place. Instruction also say to not use when temperatures are above 104 degrees or below 32 degrees and to not let unit sit under direct sunlight. If u purchase the cooler be sure to add the allotted amount of ice our you may not be happy with this. I wasn't happy with the coolness except when it was directed at me. I was using it in the living room of my apartment which is in the square footage for the unit with no access to other rooms. The unit looks nice but a little loud on medium and high speeds. Instructions say, ""Pour in 2/3 of water (6 liters) and 1/3 of ice (3 liters) for best cooling effect. Their is also a little container on the top of unit to add ice. The water indicator is on the lower left front of the unit at the bottom and is hard to read. I have to get on my knees to read it. Also the handles are on the top sides, just indentations with no lip, which make it a little hard to pull around. Having said all this, if you don't want to keep the unit clean like the instruction say to, this cooler may work for you but the warranty probably won't be good it the unit has a problem. I was excited to get this cooler and disjointed to have return it."|Negative
Fits Perfect|Positive
Surprisingly easy install tho the instructions were more complicated than they needed to be. A bit noisy at first but w/in a day, motor/belt interaction quieted down. Incredibly fast delivery. Very important when your swamp cooler motor goes out. Thank you.|Positive
We live in Las Vegas. I have used outdoor, window-style, evaporative coolers in my Utah and California (High Desert) homes. We moved into a condo in Las Vegas. Condo rules forbid anything protruding from or hanging out of the windows, so I began shopping around for a portable evaporative cooler. We have 800 square feet. When we run our air conditioning, it adds anywhere from $150 to $250 monthly during the summer months, and that is keeping it a about 80 degrees! This Champion Evaporative Cooler cooled our home to 69 degrees at night and it raised to about 78 or so in the peak of the day, and that is when it is 120 degrees in the day and 100 at night in August.. In other words, it kept our house cooler than what we could afford to do with air conditioning and it only added about $45 our monthly electric bill. Had I known that this is all it would cost, then I would have bought it long before now. I only downgraded the appearance because the casters do not roll on carpet very well, so I had to actually bend over and push them while holding the unit upright with my other hand if I wanted to put it in a different loacation. Other than that, it is a great little unit and cools 800 sq/ft condos, second story, with a hot attic, and all four sides are exposed to the sun. It also helps to dump a load of ice from my icemaker into the unit when it is half full of water. It makes it real cold air coming out.|Positive
Good quality in a very affordable price!|Positive
It didn't cooled the room at all|Negative
New pad smell was very strong for 3 days but eventually fads. They hold a large amount of water so the cooling effect is very good even in the higher humidity.|Positive
These cooler pads actually ship direct from the manufacturer. They fit perfectly and have been redesigned to improve overall saturation and water flow, increasing the evaporation capability. Highly recommend.|Positive
I was impressed that the product is made of rip stop nylon. The fit was perfect to dimension as well. One negative is the nylon tie. Although the tie is weather resistant, it needs to be secured with a knot that will not release as the material does not have a gripping ability. Make sure the base is pulled snug to the turbine and double tied. The materials should all hold up to winter very well. If these last two or more seasons, they are well worth the price.|Positive
Kit arrived in timely manner. Everything fit first time, no delays. The original kit was sent to Alabama, not west Texas where I live. That kit has notyet arrived though it was paid for.|Positive
Really good quality switch. The control knob shaft on my original switch twisted off, it was plastic. This Dial switch has a nice metal shaft.|Positive
It is well made & I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to purchase the nylon straps if I want them The nylon straps are considered accessories. They are to hold the cover on more securely. Now if I want them I have to make another order. I'm not sure Home Depot has the nylon straps available. So I might have to order from Brian's direct. That means I would probably have to pay shipping cost. For me the rope draw string at the bottom will probably be OK. That is what I'm going to try this year.|Positive
Checked online and ordered over the phone. Installer picked up and said unit would not work, Had to swap out for a different model.|Negative
The water pump only saturated less than 1/4 of the pad so the air never got cool. I had to return the item within 2 weeks of purchase. I like the size, design (except water level is VERY difficult to gauge) and portability so have ordered another but of course by then, the white cooler is sold out online and in stores. I had to settle for black, but hopefully it will work.|Negative
Great product! Absolute necessity for hot summer evenings in Arizona.|Positive
I stuck these in my cooler. Brand new and they smell like urine. I was thinking rats got into my duct work. Sealed of the 3 inlets in my house and turned the evaporative cooler fan on only, checked ducts for leaks. No leaks in the duct work. It is definitely these pads. Got online and read elsewhere that this is common. Hoping this stink goes away. I will keep shutting down the unit and draining it, to hopefully speed up the process of getting rid of the smell. I can't figure out why they would sell a product that. It by no means should take a week of running the cooler to get ride of the smell, Why would a company make a product like this. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!|Negative
After purchasing sets for two evaporative coolers I went back to get a third set to use boxing up my 9 foot christmas tree. They seem to be a better value than the other purpose built straps.|Positive
Product cools great in my 1500 sq ft house, windows opened to draw cool to back of house. The remote makes it easy to run. I have only ran it on the low speed and it keeps the home cool. We have had it for one month, no problems with any of the functions, it all is working fine. It is very easy to install needed help though, not a one person job. My daughter helped me put it in and leveling it. All to easy.|Positive
I always buy my replacement belts for my evaporative cooler here|Positive
isn't deep enough to disperse the volume of air with moisture to create a cooling effect....the box type works much better....should have a reverse fan setting to remove hot air and create cool air through the smaller openings of window adjustments as originally suggested for the forced air out|Negative
It's been too hot in the northwest these past 3 years & most of us don't have A/C units, I can't went through a window so was looking for something else to beat the heat and ran into this unit on Home Depot's web site, the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that it's very big, but boy does it beat the heat, you do have to keep a door open otherwise the humitity get to high, for the size it's very quiet, doesn't take that long to fill water tank and runs for hours, you can even take outside on the deck, moves easily, so if you have the room and can't use regular a/c units this is working great for me & I'll store in the garage in the winter|Positive
This is a very good small portable unit to cool a single room.|Positive
Cooled in small area in front of unit. Water pump shorted out within 2 weeks Not good enough for 750 sq ft in southern humidity|Negative
Does not work as advertised|Negative
Great water fan cooler. Easy to get started. Good purchase|Positive
We ordered this to replace an inferior cooler. Honeywell has done a great job engineering this unit, the permanent honey combed media is superior to the aspen pads in our previous unit and is easily cleaned. It worked flawlessly in a less than ideal situation, a windowless media room. The led controls and remote are great. Overall I am 100% satisfied with this cooler and HD's fast shipping|Positive
"If ordering online beware of the models of mastercool that the filter fits. The one I ordered stated replaces 12"" pads so I didn't do any checking on my model number. I received a 8"" pad will have to take back to store. Could have saved on shipping if I didn't order online."|Positive
They do not specify in the manual that the hardware kit (with the coaster wheels and nipple adapter) is located inside the actual product. You have to unscrew the screws holding the back panel on. the box of hardware is located inside a red bag inside the product.. THEY NEED TO SPECIFY THIS IN THE MANUAL.|Positive
I purchased this motor to build a rock polishing table. My first day I had water flow down the main shaft and over the motor. The motor wasn't damaged and continues to work fine I added to my purchase the two speed control switch everything works great. I have plenty of power and I have ran it on high for over 4 hours continuos and have had no issues with over heating. It is a little noise but for a larger motor I didn't expect it to be any quieter. It's been a great motor so far, if I have any problems with it I will update this post. I hope this helps anyone looking for a strong motor that can run continuously.|Positive
The wrap was easy to install and worked well, clinging to itself after the first pass. I give it three stars because it's simply not enough to cover my swamp cooler with anything more than 2 layers. It's also very over priced for the length you are getting.|Negative
Worked great!|Positive
cooler was easy to install- was nice to have 2 mounts for the supply water-no exposure on roof.|Positive
Great product cools my home.|Positive
Easy replacement|Positive
My onlly complaint is that it comes in only one color. A grey would be nice.|Positive
Easy to assemble but after a while the air just feels dry and not cool even with putting ice water in it. I returned it.|Negative
So glad that the cover is slightly oversized so it easily fits over the cooler and power cable.|Positive
comes with sewn string over fibers to keep coolant fibers together and out of pump.|Positive
Cool Tool did not cool house. Disappointed and discourage put to much moisture in house and I had windows and doors open plenty of venilation it didn't move air as it should. I was told the pads were to thin I wasn't going buy thicker pad for some thing new that should work. I got this to replace 2 small coolers {2800 CFM} and just one of those work better than this cooler I was very dissapointed . Before It went back I read a nd I have used evaporative coolers for the last 25 years this thing doesn't work as it should. I used this over 5 times thinking the humidity was to high until it was below 10 % here and this house was hot and humid and I said enough is enough it went back. (Hot and Humid = above 85 degrees and more than 70% humidity) I have 5 thermometers in this house 1 in very room 1450 sq ft. Home Depot is not at fault here, but I am sure dissapointed in Phoenix Manufacturing on this and I know they make better products than this.|Negative
Works in most large ECs. Susceptible to corrosion.|Positive
Easy installation, well built, and it will absolutely freeze you out! I live in Southern California, and the outside was 95 and inside was a cool 74 and that was on low speed. I had to work outside for a couple of hours so I turned it on high and when I came in it was a freezing 70! The remote control is a nice feature and it works great! You can't go wrong with this unit, I would recommend it to anyone!|Positive
Works great as a fan and water cooler|Positive
I am satisfied with the performance of this unit. It perfectly suits my needs.|Positive
Living in SE Colorado, the air is dry and hot. This works excellent in my 1500 sf home. One thing you should do if you have hard water/scale, is to clean out the unit every couple of weeks with a vinegar solution (or whatever cleaning solution that you may use). Build up hinders efficiency.|Positive
Great while it worked. The pump stopped working after 1 month of use, and of course during a horrible heat wave. I called Home Depot to set up a repair appt. Still waiting for a call back so for now we have a giant fan.|Negative
We purchased one of these 3 years ago when our electric bill was regularly running in the $300+ range in summer months due to the air conditioner in the house we rent. It keeps our 1400 sq ft house comfortable in the middle of our Mojave Desert summers. It does so well that we rarely run the fan at other than the lowest setting. The only issue I've had with it is the rapid accumulation of mineral deposits due to the hard water in our area. I have to clean the pads once a month to keep them in check. I think I'll be replacing them before the worst of the heat this year.|Positive
Works well, better than we anticipated. - might be a little too cool - using ice not helpful as it melts too quickly and cannot be maintained with ease|Positive
Like the fine print says it works best in arid weather, not humidity. My friend in arizona had 2 of these on the roof in bullhead city only death valley is hotter, and this guys house was always cold on 110 deg days, I live in riverside ca and myself and friends all have these to save money and they work great, but you have to set it up so the water level is right and the spider water supply is actually running down the grass pads and not just back in the water tank. My dads roof unit is 30 yrs old and every summer it works like a champ - ion....|Positive
Overall the cooler was pretty simple to install. Once I figured out how to take it apart, that is. Keeps my green house at the temperature where I need it. The installation instructions around the motor/pulley were a bit on the vague side for someone who does not deal with this type of equipment. But, I was able to work around the issues encountered. Over all the unit works well, time will tell how long it will last.|Positive
It fit my cooler well. Added two bungee cords to secure it.|Positive
Good Pump|Positive
The unit has been a blessing this summer. I would recommend.|Positive
Have only had it a short time, but puts out nice cool air on my covered patio. Makes my time out there much more enjoyable since I am not pouring sweat! Product is a little cheaply constructed, but works well as designed.|Positive
I was not overly impressed. There was 1 bolt for the motor bracket missing (has special washer). It's quit obvious it was never put on. There several small dents in the uprights between top and bottom.|Negative
Snaps right on. No muss, no fuss. Pops right back off easy (if you're careful and don't reef on it hard.)|Positive
Good value. As described.|Positive
This cooler replaced an older worn and weathered identical unit. This champion cooler is very effective and efficient, keeping the temperature in my home comfortable as long as the humidity remains low. It consumes a small amount of energy, and my electrical bill is low. It runs quietly, requiring little maintenance. The remote control provides a convenient means of control, which saves steps. I recommend it highly.|Positive
We live about 1.5 hours northwest of Austin, TX. I did a lot of research and decided to take a chance on this cooler after reading other positive reviews from those who also live in humid climates. My husband loves it and says with the garage door open (we have a standard two-car garage) it cools the garage adequately for him to be able to work on his car when it is 95-100 degrees outside as long as the fan is blowing directly on him. (The thermostat in the garage will come down to 85-91.) However, the smell coming from the unit smells of musty old socks. (I'm hoping that quickly dissipates as advertised.) Adequate cross ventilation is essential otherwise the humidity from the unit builds up quickly. This unit is used with the garage door halfway open and the window at the other end of the garage open all the way. I thought this unit would cool the garage down more than it does but my husband seems impressed with it. He says the amount of air circulating in the garage makes all the difference.|Positive
The cooler was easy to install, in less than an hour it was running and cooling the house. Summer 2017 has had record heat and the cooler has been running nearly 24/7 for more than two months. Many days have been well over 100 degrees and the house has stayed in the 70s. Very satisfied.|Positive
Fit no problem!!|Positive
We moved to Sun City CA last summer where SCE is giving away this unit including installation to qualified homeowners.We were approved for one. The wait is quite long.By the time it was installed,it was already winter.So we bought an outside cover for it and wait for summer to come.Once we started using it,we are very impressed.It is so powerful,so quiet that we think it is better than using a whole house ac unit.Our house is about 1200 sq ft.It cools the whole house in no time.Besides getting cool air,we get fresh air and moisture too.It is very comfortable. As for quality,we honestly don't know yet.Too soon to tell.Installation? The guys that installed it spent about half an hour. They told me that cleaning is not needed for 5 years.That is something I cannot trust.We'll clean it may be once a year, or when the air smells different,I hope. One more thing to remember,if the unit is not being used for sometime,it will smells but will be OK in a day or two.|Positive
Have used swamp coolers for decades and this one stands with the best of them in quality, quiet, ease of operation, istallation and cost. If there was a slot and optional interior filter available for it, it would have been perfect. Desert is full of critters and the filter would have helped seal the number of small openings and earned it a 5th star...-++++++++++++++|Positive
We've been using your evap coolr pumps for many years. Very functional, thank you very much. Have a wonderful day.|Positive
The cover was the right size and was easy to install on our evaporative cooler. I had another cover that was made out of some other material that only lasted one winter season so I decided to try this canvas one and already it seams to work better.|Positive
I've had the cooler less than one month. The good: It is light weight and easy to install. It does work well by saturating the pads completely and the fan is strong. The bad: The plastic that it's made out of is very soft. In setting this up, there are already several screws that have stripped out. My expectation is that as I have to open it up year after year to replace the pads, all of the screws involved will strip out. I found out too late that here in Colorado, it only qualifies for a $200 rebate. There are other coolers that are not much more expensive that will get you a $600 rebate. All in all.... I would recommend that you find a different cooler.|Negative
Product is functional. Down side is price compared to other products was a bit high.|Positive
We have been using evaporative coolers for years and years and they are usually maintenance free except for routine things. This cooler has required repairs pretty constant. We’ve gone through two motors in a year and the pump is bad again now. I winterized it early since it was constantly broken|Negative
It blew some cool air, pump needs to be stronger if anything. I bought I bought it because it uses less wattage than an air conditioner. It's useful for additional cool air in another part of a room|Negative
Works great and covers large area.|Positive
Doesn't cool at all. Just blows air like a fan. Doesn't use much water either. Don't know if it is defective or what...…….|Negative
Does not cool adequately|Negative
We use it to cool our bedroom in the summer and to circulate warm air in the winter.|Positive
Hi Summer, you're here already... While the rest of the country is emerging from winter and enjoying spring we're already in the 90 degree range in April here in the southwest. The bright side? As they say it's a dry heat, which makes it perfect for evaporative cooling. This unit was the perfect option for us for a few reasons. It's extremely portable, the casters allow it to be wheeled around with ease. Not to mention the size is just perfect for our space and it's not too large that it can't be tucked into a corner or moved to a shed for off-season storage. It's also handsome or at least as much as evap coolers can be. We have this in our covered patio in the backyard. With the effort put into getting outdoor rugs and nice looking patio furniture I didn't really want to put an eyesore of a cooler out there. We currently just fill it with the garden hose, but it does have an attachment should you want to hook your hose directly to the reservoir. So far it's worked great and gets us outside just a little longer into the year.|Positive
This is my second purchase of this product. It is extremely durable but shrinks over time due to weathering. My last cover lasted 20 years with no holes. It just didn't cover my swamp cooler anymore. I would say this is a very good investment.|Positive
Met the need. Only draw back was length of power cord. Had to relocate pump because cord was not long enough for the original location.|Positive
First unit died after 2 days, replacment seems fine. The unit works better than just a fan, but not as good as a small air conditioner. Humidity is high when running in cooling mode (not always a bad thing).|Negative
Works perfectly as designed.|Positive
Never worked|Negative
Title says it all! We got this for the garage/man cave, and it is nice if you are standing in front of it, but I could have bought a much cheaper fan if that is all we were trying to accomplish. Made the rest of the garage very humid and sticky.|Negative
These pads were exactly what I expected. They were a perfect fit.|Positive
this evaporative cooler replaced two window air conditioners that were aged and I didn't really want to go the hassle of installing them again for this summer. Reviewed the descriptions and reviews online, made the purchase at the store where they were helpful with assisting me load it. I installed it that afternoon. It is wonderful, even on the hottest of summer days.|Positive
We were very disappointed in the lack of cooling this produces.|Negative
We use this cooler in the living room. It's vert quite and keeps the room comfortable.|Positive
Works great! Using it for chicken coop and have no leaks anywhere and good motor to move air nicely! Good even water distribution over pads on all sides. Very good swamp cooler!|Positive
I had to cut them down to get them to fit, but I expected that because I purposely ordered them big. They work like a charm!|Positive
Frigidaire is such a great all in one fan and evaporative air cooler. First things first. It's super easy to understand how to operate. Very user-friendly. The instruction manual makes it all easy. The fan can be quickly moved from one place to the other as it has smooth rolling wheels. You can very well lift it. It's not heavy at all. You can pour water into a water tank(smaller one) at the top, or you can pour water into the larger bottom water tank. The remote control is such a blessing makes the fan accessible from a distance. The fan goes into silent mode as well. This very handy when you want it to be a bit quiet around the house. Overall love the Frigidaire!|Positive
I purchased this unit a year ago and it is very cheaply constructed with thin metal and cheap parts. It is installed 10' away from an Arctic Circle brand unit and there is no comparison in quality. the older Arctic Circle unit is much heavier, sturdier and easier to service. Stay away from the cheap Champion brand.|Negative
This really kept us cool this summer! We live near Seattle and these aren't sold locally, probably because of a slightly higher humidity than the rest of the west coast. It still works great though as most of the really hot days are dry. We have about 1,300 sq ft upstairs, but it is an odd layout. The fan by itself really helps keeps air moving through the house. Nice to open up different windows and keep the air from getting too stuffy. Bonus points for blowing out the bathroom. I also helped get my aunt the same model. She was getting sick from the heat but is feeling much better since I hooked it up.|Positive
I use this in my auto shop. Our summers reach highs of 105 degrees and our roll up doors have to stay open. It's light weight for it's size and EASY for everyone to use. It was well worth every penny|Positive
This purchase was perfect for my application in our greenhouse, adjacent to our bedroom. It cools the greenhouse and exits the cool air to our bedroom requiring less need of the house heat pump also.|Positive
Easy to set up and use. It helps cool our patio.|Positive
Yes it did, it covered the area we needed and overall was an excellent buy.|Positive
I bought this as a replacement for my cooler. Works great.|Positive
Did not live up to advertising. Did not cool.|Negative
EASY TO USE, COOLS & HUMIDIFIES WELL. THIS IS MY SECOND ONE. I USE IT IN MY GREEN HOUSE.|Positive
This cooler lasted one season then the pump went out. Got a replacement but the power connector is different. So now its an expensive fan. I bought a Honeywell which seems much more durable. I would avoid.|Negative
Love this pump. It saved us from the terrible summer heat.|Positive
Way to small even to cool 600 sq ft. Does not push enough air to cool, unless you are sitting in front of it.|Negative
I do not recommend this at all . Does not cool the room at all cause u must have window open|Negative
I work in my 400 sq ft garage full-time in Phoenix, AZ and it gets very hot. I bought this unit last week and it is incredible! Yesterday it was 119 degrees outside (no joke) and in my garage it was 86 at 4pm. On a normal day the evap keeps the temperature at around 78 to 82. I would definitely recommend this unit if you live in a desert climate with low humidity. It is quite loud, but I don't care because my garage feels like I'm at the beach.|Positive
Not really work like my expectations|Negative
The unit delivers as promised. Easy to install, all the bells and whistles, with only one draw back... The unit folded the legs from the store bought leg kit. Easily fixed with a quick trip to Home Depot for some angle iron, spray paint and fastening bolts. Unit generally keeps the house 20 degrees cooler then ambient temps. We had the house at 77 degrees on a dry 99 degree day.|Positive
Functions as advertised. Installation is simple if you are familiar with electrical wiring. My installation involved a 230v 2-speed motor and a 120v pump. Works very well. Like the back-lit display!|Positive
The Cooler is not properly assembled when delivered. The buyer must take apart the Cooler and remove the legs and close the product back up. The water measuring device on 2 Coolers ordered does not work properly. The Cooler is great once assembled.|Positive
The unit does not include a manual. But it does move alot of cool air|Positive
Easy to install works great!|Positive
Let you know after I have gotten to use it for a while. It is installed but haven't used it only to test it. It really pushed the air through out the house.|Positive
C S was good delivery was a little slow but it got here, delivers did good job|Positive
Works well for the 200 square foot room I'm using it in.|Positive
I haven't had a chance to use it yet but it looks like it will meet my needs when the temperatures get hot next summer.|Positive
They arrived broken and will return have not received them again and still waiting on satisfactory and not happy yet|Negative
Well made and easy to install once I got the old bearings off.|Positive
Seems to work fine and fit the duct from my old one well. With the screws going through the pan I don't expect this unit to last half as long as my old one (which was 22 years old and I'm thinking I should've kept it a couple more years even though it was starting to rust out a bit). Here's to hoping...|Positive
Installed new one and it did the same thing as the bad one|Negative
Home depot only had one of these 1 in. Low rise. And many high rise. They have just the bearing so you would need to save the low rise housing and R & R.|Positive
I highly recommend the Mastercool evaporative coolers such as the ADA7112. This unit will be the one I will save for and purchase as a replacement unit, due to the fact that it has more features than my current Champion evaporative cooler that needs replacement. Features include much better air quaility, a better cooling ratio of 5-10 degrees, less power used and the ability to run off of a thermostat. The savings for the unit amount to over $1800.00 as compared to buying the unit from a heating and cooling company.|Positive
It's only been in a month so far so good we'll see|Positive
We are still waiting for the evaporative cooler that is supposed to go with it and is now 3 weeks late.|Negative
Didn't make it through 3 winters. It was good the 1st winter (drafty but it stayed on), started tearing the 2nd winter (had to wrap rope from top to bottom to keep it on), became completely useless midway through last winter (it's 3rd winter), we not only had it additionally tied from top to bottom but across the middle as well. Even with all the extra rope wrapped around it still continued to rip apart and failed to stay in place - good thing we didn't have a wet winter. For $50 I expected a better product, I won't be buying another one of this brand.|Negative
Works as advertised.|Positive
Did the job.|Positive
Pretty ineffective. Definitely not worth the price.|Negative
Great replacement for my 35 year old swamp cooler. It dropped right in with very little adjustments. It also came with everything it needed other than the motor and pads|Positive
It's a bigger unit then we had and it will cool the house a lot better.|Positive
Works better than expected. Great product.|Positive
"Looks nice but can't cool like traditional evaporative coolers , the cooling pad never gets fully soaked and that cooling pad is over $100.00 to replace and that's if you do it yourself, plus, the disassembly to replace the pad is awkward and a pain in the neck. Mine is getting replaced with a traditional evaporative cooler. I actually refer to my master cool as a ""disaster-cool"". Mine was brand new and my house was never as cool as homes with traditional type coolers."|Negative
Im using this to cool my Southern California home I read the reviews and agree This is Not an Air conditioner it creates humidity and its cool when there is enough air around it If you sit infront of it It cools real well but not the temp of the house|Positive
I purchased these pads to replace the 10 year old original Mastercool pads in my cooler. The old ones worked well aside from the musty smell and the scaly residue and dirt on them. I purchased these hoping to renew some efficiency and freshen up the smell of my house - I was wrong. First was the smell. My house reeked like a dull saw blade cutting through old construction scraps. It was nearly unbearable. After about 3 days the smell subsided a little Then there is the cooling, or lack thereof. The old pads would cool my house to around 68F in mid-afternoon on a 95 degree day and easily reach 62 during the night. I have my cooler controlled by a thermostat. When I set it at 68 it would cycle off and on several times an hour. With these pads, it will not cool below 74F and runs ALL DAY LONG, I would be better off hanging a wet towel in the window and let the breeze blow through. I live in a very dry climate in Central Utah. These should be working a heck of a lot better than they are Lesson learned - Stick with OEM pads. These don't work.|Negative
Easy to install; will keep our evap cooler pumps free of dirt.|Positive
ordering process pretty straight forward, but the 500 CFM 3-Speed Portable Evaporative Air Cooler is really nothing more than a glorified fan. Very disappointing. Need information on how to return the product.|Negative
good in windy weather works well. Looks neat. good quality|Positive
"Shocked at how many people don't read instructions or at least use common sense when it came to this product. Even on box it is printed in really large and hard to not notice lettering ""THIS IS NOT AN AIR CONDITIONER"" Can you put ice in it, most likely several trays, just follow the directions or use common sense. Can you see the water level, yes, it is right in front of the machine at the bottom, also if you look in the 3"" x 5"" water door, where you pour the water in, you can see the water level as well. Can this cool you ice cold...no, it is not an air conditioner. All it does is exactly what a swamp cooler will do, but on a much smaller scale. I bought this for my garage workshop, have only been using it for a few hours and so far am not too impressed. Remember swamp cooler, I'm use to refrigerated air in my houses. So most likely I'm going to take this one back and pick up a refrigerated air unit instead. Will cost about $100 more, will require me to port the air to the outside and most likely will cost more to run. The trade off will be not having to fill this monster up with 4+ gallons of water for every eight hours of use. All this I knew when I bought the unit."|Negative
Pads were exactly as described and were a perfect fit. I would definitely recommend them for a replacement of original media pads.|Positive
much larger than I expected but does what I needed!|Positive
Perfect size for our cooler. Came a bit oversized to allow for shrinkage. . Smart buy.|Positive
The fan power is not the greatest. Considering the size of the fan it should be better. The cold air is not really cold neither.|Negative
Need to cool a roughly 250 square foot room and this swamp cooler do not do the job. Even putting ice in the water tank it did not get the area cool enough. I will have to consider getting a portable air conditioner.|Negative
The same product was replaced by this pump. It was easy to swap out of the A/C.|Positive
The Portacool Cyclone 160 has been great in our barn.|Positive
I can't give 5 stars because I need to see how this holds up over time, but I suspect it will be durable. It's very heavy and well made. I used a strap on it to hold it in place, but that was probably unnecessary because I think its weight alone will hold it.|Positive
"I've installed many of these coolers over the years. Everytime they work just as they are supposed to. I have only received one repeat conplaico for all customer's. ""The smell of glue for the first few days) but after that everyone is happy. After installing this last one, the cooler took the 88° home to 68° in less than 3hrs. Thank you mastercool and home Depot."|Positive
We do not have central heat/air in our home, so we have a small AC unit in the main room of the house and use fans in the other rooms. I was excited to see how well this evaporative cooler worked in one of the bedrooms. The cooler was quick and easy to set up. It is portable and light so it can be wheeled anywhere. This unit came with 2 reusable ice packs that are optional to use, a remote control, and easy to understand instructions. The remote is VERY simple to use and works great! This cooler is hands down quieter than our AC unit and fans even on the highest setting. The timer feature will be handy since even in our are in the summer, it can still drop down to the high 40's. The room we use it in is about 300 square feet. I wouldn't expect it to cool a room any larger, the cooler does state it will cool up to 250 square feet and I believe it does this effectively. Recommended!!|Positive
Very quiet, very efficient! Happy with my purchase!|Positive
"This is the 2nd cooler like this I've owned. The renters didn't replace/clean pads so, after 3 years of their use, when I went to go pull the back off to replace the pads, the backing broke as the pads were ""cemented"" to it. I have a 2400 sq. ft. house and on a hot 115-degree Las Vegas, NV, day, this cooler will keep the house about 85 or so. Hot yes, but with this cooler being 110, running my two 220 A/C units would have my electric bill upwards of $800/mo vs, the approx. $115/mo with this swamp cooler running on high all the times. I can certainly live with my house being 85 when I have ceiling fans in most rooms too. l have had SO many comments on how cool my house is with it (not necessarily when it's 115 degrees though). Now, during the monsoon season, I run this cooler in the a.m. and will switch to A/C if it rains/muggy. I would probably give it 5 stars IF HD CARRIED THE REPLACEMENT PADS! I can only find them for $115 on Bonaire's site, but may try and make some out of regular aspen pads first and try that."|Positive
Easy setup. Cools perfectly.|Positive
Very nice and it really cooled the room nicely.|Positive
Fit like a glove replacing old pads. And easy to replace|Positive
Don't buy this piece of garbage the electronics won't even last one season. Putting a circuit board in a swamp cooler is a horrible idea.Also you cannot hook a thermostat to this unit.The best units are wc44 and wc46 but home depot is so stupid they don't even sale them in the store. I wish home depot would quit catering to stupid customers that will buy this junk because they think it's neet that it has a remote. You won't even need a remote folks a thermostat would be of more value.|Negative
I have a high ceiling 720 sq. ft. brick shop and it cannot keep up. At all. Even running for days. Also, the float valve is finicky and never fills the tank to the top. The low level shut off is also adjusted poorly and shuts off WAY before it should. The hose connector also leaks nearly continuously. Eventually I'll replace that connector with something a little more foolproof. Or maybe just upgrade altogether.|Negative
Even though there was a map showing where the cooler was not recommended it didn't say specifically it didn't work in this area. So for those in the Los Angeles area it does not work in the greater Los Angeles area. The cooler looks great and operates smoothly, there is just too much humidity to make it effective. I bought this for a gift so it was disappointing.|Negative
This evaporative cooler was a little tricky to put together, but well worth the effort. Even though the weather hasn't been really hot yet, we can tell that it is going to do the job. Even on low, we've had to turn it off in the evenings because it gets too cool. And it's very cheap to run--just running a fan is all the power it uses.|Positive
The cover seems to do what I was expecting|Positive
I've wired other cooler thermostats Could'nt get this to work on my mastercool. No help at Home Depot. Couldn;t find a tech support number. Taking back the Master Stat model #110423-1.|Negative
I live in an apartment that is very humid since we are on the top floor. I suffer from allergies and asthma, and I needed something to help with my breathing. This air cooler definitely fits the bill. It's easy to set up and I could tell a difference in my office in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend this.|Positive
Nice cover, better than I expected as the canvas is thick. Fit my Mastercool ADA71 like a glove.|Positive
The last pump in my evap cooler was a 7,500 cfm model and my house was unbearably hot and the servicemen told me I'd just have to put up with it. This year I put in a new 11,000 cfm pump and once more my house is Cool and Comfortable, even in 102 deg heat!! It soon will be even hotter here in Fresno, but with this new pump and its higher capacity, I'll be cooler and happier.|Positive
Cools our patio in the summer heat to allow us to enjoy the outdoors more.|Positive
Filled the need to cover the unit, not as durable as I thought it would be. Price point a little high.|Positive
This Cooler does what a cooler does and it does it very well. I have a 1200sq foot home and I feel this is the perfect size for my home. It moves a lot of cool air around my house which has 4 ceiling vents. It was easy to disassemble which made it much easier to lift onto my roof.|Positive
GREAT PRODUCT AND VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED. ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH HOME DEPOT PRODUCTS.|Positive
Water eats coolers where i instaled this unit, i like that the water never touch the fan box. had to put on top of a two story house was able to take apart and lift the smaller parts up on the roof and put back together. easy to install and wire in.|Positive
Arrived damaged. Pump broke loose and the hose fitting was broken. I am I am giving this three stars because they did take care of it and I was able to fix it.|Negative
We bought this unit to cool our garage and it's about 400 sq ft if not a big smaller and it did not feel cool in the slightest. It did feel a bit humid. We were not fans and returned the product.|Negative
Easy install, Worked, replace the same pump that died after 3 years of use.|Positive
This is exactly what I needed. Another hardware store tried to get me to buy something I didn;t need and the associate at Home depot knew what I needed as soon as I explainned it|Positive
Good tool|Positive
I have a very old house with of course, very small windows. This unit fits perfectly and does the job that we need.|Positive
This unit is designed much better than the previous mastercool cooler I had. The thermoplastic wet section should last much longer than the original unit .|Positive
Love this...it is perfect works just as I hoped...I bought it because my air conditioning can't keep up once the temperature hits 100...I turn this on & it provides a small area of cool breeze until the temperature drops under 100...So thankful|Positive
I use it to drain my Swamp Cooler holding tank! It is small enough to be left in the swamp cooler cabinet.|Positive
Surprised that it was already assembled, which made it super easy to set up. Works as advertised so far, very pleasey|Positive
works ok. although I maybe should have purchased a larger cfm unit.|Positive
The first unit I received vibrated too much so I exchanged it for another. The second one seems to work well.|Positive
Be prepared to replace this pump every 1-2 years if you live in an area that has hard water.|Negative
Well made. Sturdy. Heavy weight.|Positive
"Fit like a glove and looks nice. Very easy to install. Yes, it would be good to have sewn in slits for the chains that support the cooler, but I was able to make small slits and get the ""S"" holders reattached without destroying the integrity of the cloth."|Positive
It is strong a durable|Positive
I live in the desert, so it's hot and dry. This product makes it so that I can work out in our garage gym without getting overheated. It's also great on the patio when we want to sit outside with the kids. I would absolutely recommend it.|Positive
We live in a cathedral ceiling two level condo where the upstairs is typically 2-3 degrees warmer than lower level. Once we purchased this unit our temperature is now the same on both levels, it is much more comfortable upstairs at night. We love it so much we bought a second for our vacation home.|Positive
Was very easy to install, only took a couple of hours. Love how cold the house is, better than using the a/c the air is moist which is great for allergies. I highly recommend this swamp cooler you won’t regret it.|Positive
This cooler was the perfect replacement for the rusted unit on the roof. Fit was straight forward and it was relatively easy to install. The price was fair and the quality was good. The cooler arrived with all necessary fittings except the motor.|Positive
These work great. Keep all the windows and doors closed. I have 5 in my house now. House stays much cooler with the air venting to the atic. Helps reduce the heat there too.|Positive
This Cooler did not cool at all on any given day. It is an expensive fan and a regular floor fan would do better.|Negative
It's good for the price|Positive
Love these covers. Bought 3 of them. Looks to be made of good quality. The best of all is they went on very easy and for years I have been using trash bags to cover these, What a pain with the duct tape and all. these are a dream compare to that. If I knew years ago that this product was available I would have got these along time ago. And also I had some strong wind here lately. and they stood the test of blowing off. Give this a A+ Rating.|Positive
At first glance I thought the water pump was way to small. I was so wrong. I have a 1560 sq ft home in Nevada. It gets hot an so far this first summer I have not even needed to put it on hi. I also didn't think I would like the 3 panel directional output but hats a nice option as well. makes the air flow multi directional. Quiet and efficient. happy with my buy.|Positive
I bought this because it had 4 stars from two reviews. This was for my dad since he is diabetic. This cooler didn't cool at all and smelled like it was burning. I ended buying an ac with this inland empire weather...an ac is a must.|Negative
Installed the end of July last year. Died first part of May this year. It sat inside all winter long on a shelf in my garage. Was in use about 4 months for 2-3 hours a day. Was great while it worked.|Negative
Great product fits both 14 and 12 inch turbine roof vents. Better than the cloth/canvas style.|Positive
fits on great and protects from weather is better than competitors light weight product.|Positive
Live in East Texas where the heat is awful. This has made all the difference in the world.Works so well told my daughter who lives in Corpus Christi and she said I nailed it. Do not hesitate purchase...great machine!|Positive
This product beyond expectation worked well. It was very cold in a hot garage while I was working on my car. I didnt expect it to work so good, but it is perfect for this extremely hot weather condition here in the Houston area. Thank you for this product!|Positive
very hot lately does good!|Positive
There was no assembly required. The cooler works well with ice in it. Wouldn't work well for large area but is great for smaller areas or for folks like myself that have no way to put a window or roof top mount cooler.|Positive
Love this product. It turns a horrible Louisiana summer afternoon into a pleasant relaxing enjoyable experience.|Positive
This has been a great air conditioner for our 1500 soft home. Our house has been very cool in 90 degree weather . At night we turn it off because it has cooled the house so nicely, before we had the air conditioner going 24hrs a day and it was never cool enough. Setup was simple and it is very quite.|Positive
it cost me about $100 for paper so rather pricey for what it is but i couldn't find it elsewhere cheeper so i bought it. other reviews said they were unhapy about an odor - I have NO ODOR at all.. i did clean the old crud out of the pan and I did NOT use any addatives.. the install instructions say it you do it will void the warranty.. but it didn't need it anyway so save your $$..|Positive
This cooler is a step up from our previous Mastercool. The 12 inch media makes a noticeable difference. If it lasts 25 years like the first one, it will probably be the last cooler I'll ever buy!|Positive
Appears to be a very good product. How long will it last? Time will tell if it is an excellent product or not.|Positive
My shop is 2400 sq ft, and this cooler does a good job of keeping the entire shop reasonably cool.|Positive
Looks good. Good fit. Seems sturdy and heavy enough. Time will tell how it endures the weather.|Positive
This unit cools DN our 2100 square foot home on low setting to a comfortable 70 degrees. great unit.|Positive
I live in a drafty old house, and we found that in winter a lot of our heat was going right out the roof through the cooler. I don't have the money to buy a new Evap cooler, especially when the one we have is working fine. The cover was a cheap alternative to save energy and make our home more comfortable. It also protects the cooler from critters and the elements. This is a new cover after the old one of 5+ years fell apart. It's easy to install and durable during storms and frosts.|Positive
This evap. cooler was purchased for the garage and it is a perfect solution for those hot days. Cools it down between 10 and 20 degrees. Husband hooked it directly to a water source so no need for constant re-fills. Runs great and with proper maintenance, ie emptying it after use and running the fan to let the pads dry, there have been no odors like I've read in other reviews. Our neighbors all love it as well and are now considering purchasing ones for their garages and work shops. We are also thinking about getting another one for our house. Great product, highly recommend!!|Positive
Looks good so far; need at least a year to evaluate UV resistance and other weathering performance.|Positive
It fit like a glove.|Positive
Fits well. Looks good. Could be a bit heavier material.|Positive
very easy to use. i highly recommend this product. easy to install. love it|Positive
The media stinks. Mastercool or Home Depot could have said something about this. Hard to tell how well it cools, just as I finished installing, the monsoon came rolling in and pushed the humidity up. Kinda wish I'd spent the extra hundred for the 7000 cfm cooler, tho.|Negative
I was hoping that the cooler would perform better than it does, but that is not a reflection on the quality of the unit and has more to do with the fluctuating humidity levels of Central California. It performs well when the relative humidity is low, but poorly when humidity is above 40%.|Positive
I need it for a small room, and it work perfect! nice and quite. love the extra setting!|Positive
easy to use, easy to maintain. Can't believe I waited so long to buy one.|Positive
This cooler is great cools our 1600 ft home no problem.|Positive
Excellent product, keeps the home nice and cold during low humidy periods. Hard water in our area only makes the pads last 2 or 3 years, maybe in in-line water filter would help.|Positive
It was nice and thick material. It was a canvas material so even better. We get strong winds and so far with held one day of winds pretty good.|Positive
fits good|Positive
Good Fit, Good Quality.|Positive
Easy to use and works efficiently.|Positive
Canvas is thick. It's stiff right out of the bag so a bit unwieldy but it went over the cooler just fine. The only complaint is the wimpy string they use as the tie to tighten the cover around the cooler. It's barely more than kite string. The pull-string is probably best used as a way to pull a piece of parachute cord through before its first use.|Positive
Works well enough.|Positive
The best swamp cooler ever! Works much better than then another brand we bought last year (& this one cost less)! It cools house quickly -2000 +sq ft.. We live in the high desert and this has made life pleasant.|Positive
This worked perfectly for us! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an air conditioner!|Positive
This cools my house very well. Even when the outside temp was 119 degrees, the inside temp was stil in the low 80s and quickly returned to the 70s after sunset. I have made upgrades. Double up the aspen filters! Drill small holes in the side opposite the little slits in the gutters. This will allow the water to flow to both layers of media. Doing this greatly improved the effiency of my cooler. For dessert dwellers, I live in Las Vegas, be ready to replace the media every month IF you do not have filtered water. Otherwise, the outler layer will build up with sediments and stop absorbing water.|Positive
It is the exact replacement|Positive
I have been a refrigeration technician for 18 years and I know how to get the most out of a cooler. The window 5000 CFM cooler I bought at Home Depot comes with a 7,500 pump. I was able to get a third more cooling out of the cooler by 1) opening up the water trough opening with a flat tip screwdriver by one half more on each one. 2) buying this 11,000 water pump. Now ALL three cooler pads are completely covered with water. Now when it's 105 degrees outside, it's 77 degrees inside!|Positive
Love this fan. Cools my shop and garage. Great purchase.|Positive
"Same straps I used before... They are specially made for swamp cooler and worked perfectly. Long enough for my 40""x40"" and strong enough for the job."|Positive
needed new filter.. so far it works great|Positive
This unit is a replacement for one that I had before. It's Unique configuration is just the ticket for our situation.|Positive
Disappointed in lack of cooling as advertised. Is an excellent fan, but too expensive for just the fan feature.|Negative
We Vaught this in the summer and had trouble from the start. After building a stand to place the cooler on we found the insert for the water hose missing. After replacing this small but significant part we fill the cooler, turn the pump on and find that the fan doesn't work. The manufacturer had misaligned the fan brace inside the unit causing the right fan bad to catch against the housing wall. Pain in the butt|Negative
This would be so great if it had a built in timer. I only installed it a couple weeks ago so haven't done battel wtih really high temeratures yet, but it knocked 80 F down to 70 F ina about an hour in my 980 sq foot domicile. Instructions are BAD. Look the unit and the instructions over carefully and use some sense rather that trying to follow the directions to the letter. You are warned. As others mention the side curtains are too stiff to stretch and won't stick. Be prepared to insert something else. I used styro foam insulation board and duct tape. I did not buy a purge pump for it. Thhe unit has an extra little hose running of the tube up to the pads that runs a bit of water off into the overflow to keep the water fresh. This extra, continuous, overflow is not well explained in the instructions. You'll need a place to route it to . I use an old garden hose and it reaches the tree on my patio for continous watering. I got a very good clearance price and the unit is well worth what i paid for it, but I would have been very disappointed if I paid full retail. The covers which needed to be ordered on line added another $90 per unit, for both inside and outside, hopefully worth it. Installing the first unit was a challenge with the bad instructions but it willl be much simpler on the second one and can be handled by one person. Easier with two if the second isn't too bossy. Once the unit is On, airflow through the house is adjusted by opening windows in the rooms you want the cool air to circulate to. Note: It basically pressurizes your house so the cool air can also find it's way into your air intakes for your furnace. If you happen to have a fan only setting on your furnace I would guess that would be very useful circulating the cool air. But there needs to be a window open somewhere to let the air out. I had two windo AC's and this unit is easily cooling the place about 5 times faster and I'm sure cheaper on the electricity. Don't know about the water bill. There is a continual loss of water which I have not measured as yet but it's bigger than a leaking faucet.|Positive
This unit helps in my small bedroom but it only makes it tolerable when the temps are in the high 80's low 90's. I'm in the mountains so that's a good thing, if I were down in the desert where the temps are 100-115 I'm sure it wouldn't help much at all. I don't have any AC in my house where I live but I'm at 7000 feet. The wheels are useless and don't turn or rotate very well so you have to lift it or drag it across the floor if you want to move it around. It's a good thing it's not that heavy. They're small,cheap plastic wheels. It's a little loud on high but the low setting isn't bad. I'd say if you live in the mountains where I'm at where temps are in the high 80's and low 90's for only about one month which is June then you'll be ok. The monsoons usually start the first week in July and the temps drop way down so you won't need it after that. If you have the $ get a real AC unit but this does help in small rooms.|Negative
Easy installation|Positive
The unit helps keep it cooler indoors and outside|Positive
"let us start with THESE ARE NOT BEARINGS ! ! ! ! These are in fact ""Oil Fed Bushings."" The quality is ""good"" for what they are. The cushion pad is too soft for what I wanted to use them for but for a fan only application they will work fine. Just be warned if you are looking for other application use parts these ARE NOT BEARINGS."|Positive
Excellent! Nice and cool.|Positive
This is a great fan that has the extra benefits of cooling with a frozen ice pack you add to the water bucket to make cool air. I love the nature feature which makes the breeze alternate a bit instead of being a steady flow of air.|Positive
I just installed this item the other day. It works great, no issues at all. In fact, I will be ordering a second one to replace an older non-digital unit. It is easy to operate & easy to read.|Positive
Great fit and easy to install.|Positive
The cooler it’s very good i and happy|Positive
It works as I expected except that the remote does not function.|Negative
This Hessaire evaporative cooler works just fine, is not excellent cause the water level gauge does not work, it’s very difficult to know how much water you have on the reservoir.|Positive
It did not work!!!|Negative
I bought this because I rent a 2 story townhouse and the upper floor is always hot and miserable in summertime. Since I live in Colorado with low humidity it seemed a good choice compared to a standard a/c. I have a few large rooms upstairs and this works best when I have the door shut to trap the cooler air within. It does seem like I can't run it for more than about 2 hours before noticing a humidified effect such as the nearby carpets feel a little different under bare feet. It's also somewhat louder than I was hoping and doesn't seem to work nearly as well without making sure the door to the room is shut (though it does have proper air circulation as required). It's larger than I wish it was, though it rolls fairly easily, it certainly is difficult if going up or down stairs.|Positive
Easy to install works great on hi but low kind sounds like a rough idling|Positive
it worked good.|Positive
The unit was noisy! Tried everything to get the clicking noise from the motor area to stop but couldn't. Plastic front of the unit also made noise, but I was able to use a piece of cardboard between the front grill and the unit to get the vibrating sound to stop.Overall the unit was pricey junk!|Negative
use these floats in my small 3 tier fountain. needed something with short arm because of small size of fountain. these work great. have to replace every two years or so because of hard water in phoenix.|Positive
Product recomended by store associate and it's very good. Thanks.|Positive
"The first one bought had the top tie ring barely sawen on. I returned it to get a new one. The next one was in good shape, but even after tying up all the cords it still left a 6"" gap for air to blow into. Poor design!!"|Negative
"I bought the older model 2800 CFM in '08 for my mobile to save $$$ when my ancient AC unit's costs went higher than space rent. I worked at a HD and listened to some experienced customers. No shipping! Hand loaded and carefully got it home. It is small, fits the side-slider window...accidentally creating a ""double-pane"" job on half the window, and uses very little amperage. The two side panels are not removable but are easily accessed from the front slider. An old-timer showed me how to use a plastic paint spatula to scrape the salt off the door grooves every two weeks for easy removal. He also said never to ""fight"" with the wire pad holders. Just use lineman pliers to grip, twist, and remove/replace them into the holes. Easy-peasy! Our water is calcified here in the Phoenix ""Heat-Sink"" Valley. Having lived in California, Nevada, and now the Arizona deserts, one just assumes the pumps and float valves get replaced every two years. The tubing and connecter valves go with that. I use the blue foam pads. Once a month I drain, clean, use D-Scale to flush for 30 minutes, drain, and fire it up. I change the pads half way through the season. For the monsoons, I have an small internal garage velocity fan coupled with a few strategically placed Lasko box jobs. An old-school Intermatic 6 pin timer runs it. The bills are a fraction of the past. It's old, some rust to always clean, and running it on high can be risky. So what. I just ordered some new spring blades to hold the old louvers in place from Essick Air. Total of $8 incl shipping. I love this monster. Monsoons? The old-timers just ran the unit on fan-only if too wet. ""Cool-sticky"" is better than HOT. The velocity fan ""evaps"" the air through movement into the Laskos...and so on. I'll kick it up to a 3300 CFM next year in the same window. I find it odd folks commenting on this unit referring to an imaginary remote interesting since it only has a 2-speed/mode knob. Another benefit is the window is in the shade. When running, the dove, house finches, hummers, and an occasional Gila woodpecker will clamp on for a drink. Their chatter is great while doing dishes. It's small, cheap, and still runs. Change out the pads, drain the water, descale, drain, rinse, and fire away! No climbing onto the roof to replace those mega-bucks paper pads! I also run it dry in the winter as a house fan to freshen things if I don't open the windows. Works for me."|Positive
First, the biggest con: The assembly instructions are horrible! It doesn't tell you to remove 3 small screws on the inside in order to remove the bottom of the cooler. You have to do this in order to remove the base and casters. It is a HUGE Pain! I like the 6 gal water tank. You can run it for hours without having to refill. Again, the cooler works well in a small room, but it is a little loud.|Positive
I haven't had it for more than a few days so I couldn't honestly give it five stars. So far it's done a great job cooling the house down and keeping it at a consistent temperature. It was fairly easy to install and the cool air reaches farther than I expected it to. Very pleased with this system.|Positive
Used this to replace a broken pool auto-filler. Works well. The adjustability is minimal however. I may need to play with it a little more.|Positive
Excellent cooler for dry arid hot conditions. The only problem I can see is that it doesn't have an automatic shut off for times that the reservoir would run out of water, I just hope that if that ever happens the pump isn't damaged by running dry. Has a great fan to keep you feeling good even if not used as a cooler.|Positive
Moist air cool provides comfort. Can be moved easily from one room to another. No installation required.|Positive
Great in price and awesome that it was delivered to my local store to save on shipping|Positive
When it's working, and works well. Unfortunately no matter what you do, it will only last two seasons. Basically a disposable part. But I will say I have NOT found abetter product. And I have found some that don't last as long.|Positive
Easy to install, perfect fit|Positive
Easy to follow instructions. Suggest only people comfortable working with electricity install this product.Once again the staff at our HomeDepot here in Pahrump Nevada is the Best.Excellent staff.Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful.Thanks|Positive
Good quality. Fit perfect. Would rather have a more subtle color. Like grey or beige.|Positive
I took it out the box set it up put water in it and it worked for two hours insert making some god-awful noise it smelled like it was burning up.|Negative
It uses floor space, not window. It's less costly than air condi-tioner, however requires to be filled with water & ice.|Positive
Outstanding product and price. So effective I purchased two of them, one for the deck at our lake place and one for the outdoor patio at our home. 5 stars|Positive
I used this in our living room. If you don't add ice on it, it won't be cold like having an A/C unit. You use only water, it blows somewhat cold air. It was more like a humidifier than air cooling system. I was not satisfied nor too disappointed. I just did not do my thorough research before actually purchasing the unit. I will keep it as a back up unit.|Negative
This is a waste of money!!!! Just buy a portable AC and get it over with. DO NOT BUY THIS.|Negative
Canvas is light weight. Material is probably only good for less then 3 years in the California climate. Draw string is VERY light weight and will ONLY last 1 winter season before it starts decomposing. The prior statements are based on my personnel experience in the past with this supplier's product.|Positive
Imprtant summer part that is not stocked in store and has a 10+ day lead time. This should have been an on the shelf item thru the fall.|Negative
This didn't cool the room at all. In fact, I felt like it might have generated some heat LOL. I returned it the next day. I hope it works better for others.|Negative
Very good product.|Positive
They were easy to cover|Positive
Fit and worked well! Good price!|Positive
worked very well|Positive
This cover only has 3 sides. If your swamp cooler is like most (mine) then it's one side short|Negative
Totally failed to meet my needs. I may have expected too much based on other reviews I saw but I put this in a greenhouse hoping to cool it down and add some moisture to the air. Made no difference in the temperature and just added moisture on the windows so now have a muddy looking mess on the glass. Turned it off after 3 days and stuck it in garage.|Negative
It’s decent but not particularly sturdy. Probably best installed in a protected location. I had to install it facing the southwest sun and hope the plastic will hold up.|Negative
It was easy to assemble. Great fan, not as noisy as the drum fan I was using. The oscillating feature is great for moving the air around evenly. Must admit the garage was still hot when temps were in the 90s outside with the evaporated system on.|Positive
I was shocked when I went to pick this unit up, as it was HUGE! Perhaps four feet tall. Its lowest fan speed is really powerful and I wash they had a much slower speed. I would not have bought this unit had I known how big it was.|Positive
Make sure you look at the bottom footprint before creating the structure to hold the cooler. Be prepared to pay an additional $150 for a new motor before you start.|Negative
Does not cool well|Negative
I have been using this Evaporative Air Cooler for the last few weeks in Phoenix, Arizona where we had still been experiencing 100 degree weather and I must say I was pleasantly surprised of how powerful it was! I initially used the cooler in my living room as it is south facing and is the warmest room in our house. It blew cold air in the living room and I felt very comfortable with the cooler being on (I actually grabbed a throw as I became cold). I liked how the unit gives two options of how water can be added either on the top of the unit or at the bottom near the basin. Also, the product can operate without water as well. Product was easy to move around the house in which we eventually moved it into our bedroom to utilize the night time feature in which the cooler fan blows less air so that you don't freeze at night. My only con about the product is that the blower is really loud. Overall, this cooler is a good product that I will recommend to family and friends.|Positive
worked as stated.|Positive
Works as expected. Could use a larger cooling pad|Positive
I returned it the next day. Did not blow very cold. I have a portable cool master swamp cooler that's 10 yrs old. Guess I was hoping it would work an good an the one in my garage. Was sadly disappointed.|Negative
This cooler does exactly what the ad says it will do....working overtime the past few weeks here in So. Cal......|Positive
Exactly what I was looking for. Great material, thick, sturdy. This should definitely last for a long time.|Positive
It does lower the room temperature but not as advertised. Maybe 5 to 10 degrees, but definitely not 10 to 20 degrees lower.|Negative
Was not long enough to allow for length of tube and distance from front of refrigerators to tube.|Negative
The product itself is fine, but the size does not fit I even measured before ordering to be sure and according to the description of the product these pads should of been a little to big which is what I wanted, but they are about 2 in short all around. Looks like I will still have to go to the store and get the right ones. Would of avoided this problem if HD would stock them starting in MAY when the weather here in the desert starts to get hot, but NO they waited till last week to stock them in store. Very dissatisfied with HD on this 1 fact.|Positive
My only complaint is I wish I had the remote controlled model. Didn't know one was available until after delivery.|Positive
Other than having issues with the condition of the unit when it was delivered once to the store and the 2nd time to the house. Both times it came with dents and bends where they should not have them. The unit cools our 1900 sq ft home very well!|Positive
It doesn’t cool at all. Remote is not working.|Negative
Heavy duty canvas and fits perfectly. The only downside is you really need additional straps to hold this in place.|Positive
A bit thin,but will do the job.Great price.|Positive
needed to replace my old swamp cooler motor. this motor did the trick. easy to install. works better than the old one, quieter too.|Positive
I cannot tell - picked up the cooler around May 14th and still have not got the motor or control unit - hope its a cool summer at this rate|Negative
The swamp cooler pump is a basic water pump that has operated exactly as expected.|Positive
I am enjoying it. Thank you for s great product. ;)|Positive
I f you are in the market for a portable swamp cooler, this one works great! Easy to move around, easy to fill and ready to go out of the box. Just need to install the wheels which is very easy to do. Be prepared for some odor from the cooling pads when first used. I would like to see this problem solved. I recommend this product. I use it in the house and out in the garage where it does a nice job making a hot workshop very manageable.|Positive
Started leaking water after 2 years from front panel.|Negative
It is easy to fill. Easy to set up. Cooled my 30'x40' hobby greenhouse by about 10 degrees, 98deg to 88 deg in about 30 min. Also added humidity, 40% to 60%. Have not had extreme Santa Anna ( super hot and dry weather) condition yet. I think it will help in that situation. So far I am happy with it. My research was that Home Depot had best price. I gave 4 stars only because haven't used it in extreme dry hot weather yet.|Positive
I like this unit. It is relatively small and easy to work with. It does a good job cooling when the outside humidity is low. Very good quality and easy to install.|Positive
My house is 1200 sq. Ft. And it keeps the whole house super cool on medium, I highly recommend it.|Positive
I love these covers. This particular one was returned because it was the wrong size.|Positive
cools the house pretty good am happy with it|Positive
acceptable|Negative
cover is well made and fit like a glove. I am happy with my purchase.|Positive
Didn't need the outer housing, the inner bearing fit into my cooler housing perfectly.|Positive
Bought this 2 months ago and yesterday noticed the cooler wasn't blowing cold. checked things and sure enough the pump was seized. Freed it up and it ran fine, but one I shut it off for the night and let it sit, froze up again. Will be returning in hopes of refund or exchange.|Negative
Overall ok, water pump did not work.|Negative
Too expensive for something you need to be in front of to feel the cool air. This will not cool any size room at all.|Negative
Pads are as described. They do have a wet wood smell at first but it's gone after a few uses.|Positive
Great product, beats putting trash bags on the turbines. Easy to install and appears to be a long lasting material.|Positive
I nave used the unit 2 times and it works to cool garage or my shop.|Positive
This fan was too expensive and it did not work at all. This product was returned and the day I returned it there were two other people returning the same product .|Negative
High maintenance product having to fill the ice feature and water reservoir frequently on hot days and the cooling was minimal.|Negative
This is the worst unit ever. Super loud. Its loudness is a known problem, and i even talked with the manufacturer and they said there wasnt anything i could do. There are two speeds, fast and really fast, there is no “low” speed. This is partly why it is so loud. Do not buy this if you want a peaceful and quite summer..... also, this isnt the first time i’ve posted about this unit. But some how there isnt a single review to be found. Hmmmm? I remember reading other people’s issues that were very similar|Negative
good motor.|Positive
Overall it does the job, will keep a small space cool. My complaints are with the quality of the product. It's very cheaply made. The water gage was a plastic sticky strip that was smashed during packaging, and screw was missing from the back of the cooler. Not very impressed|Negative
Does not cool ,I put in a room to help the central air,followed the directions,even installed a ice pack in the water container,ran for 6 hrs,did not cool only made the room muggy, I’ll will be returning it tomorrow.|Negative
Not a bad cooler. Price is right. Does not leak, I would definitely recommend! I use to keep my dogs cool!!|Positive
I have had this unit for over a year. I live in Colorado so just in the more recent years has it gotten hot enough to need an air cooler during the summer months. I purchased last July near the end of the month so only needed it for a short time afterwards but the temperature was getting so high in the house that I needed something. Went with this unit because at the time, the few reviews that were on the HD website were good. I had to call someone to come install it because the directions were not clear at all. After installing, the pump was not putting out as much water as it should so it wasn't operating to its full capability but managed to keep the house at a manageable temperature (manageable meaning 82 when the temp was high 90's). The person who installed it notified me that you must make sure you crack the windows in any room you want the air to penetrate, otherwise, I would not have known. It worked for the month I needed to use it after purchase. Once winter passed and it started warming up again, I used for maybe two weeks before it stopped working. I used the manual to troubleshoot and I got to the point where it said to check the fuse to see if it was blown. I was confused because nowhere in the manual did it specify where this fuse was located in the writing or any of the drawings. I called the mfg and was told that there was no fuse (Really?) and that it sounded like it was the switch that was out. They sent me a new switch (no instructions included) and had to call the same person to install the new switch. During installation he discovered that the switch was assembled upside down so had to reconfigure the new switch so it would fit in the current machine. The clips that hold the switch in were very flimsy and broke as he was trying to affix the new switch. So, needless to say, the new switch was in but you couldn't press on the buttons or the switch would sink back into the cooler. Thank goodness for the included remote. Afterwards, we had a long period of rain and cooler weather so didn't have to use it for a few weeks. Once it warmed up again, I used the cooler for a few days before it stopped working again. This time, the lights and the pump would kick on but the fan would not rotate. At that point, I was so mad that I spent this amount of money on the cooler plus the cost of installation for the new cooler and the new switch that I decided to write the company. I asked them to forward to management because I was so unhappy with the cooler. I didn't really expect them to do anything but they suprised me by calling me and telling me that they would send me a new cooler since they had since modified the one that I had and this one should perform better. I am just hoping that the new one, when it arrives, can easily be installed and performs much better. It apparently has covers for the exterior and interior sides for winter timeframe if you do not remove from window during this time but you cannot order them online. You have to call the company and order them. The price was too high for the quality of the product received. Would expect something to last a lot longer for this price. I would not have even considered paying this price if I knew it would have only worked for a few months.|Negative
It Helps with the heat ( not like an air conditioner) but after only three weeks it spits water and leaks|Negative
makes the room more humid. didn't cool down a thing after a couple of hours running.|Negative
The New Air, AFR-1000 I ordered, is a vibrant fire-engine, red color. The blower has 3 speeds and provides plenty of airflow. The buttons on the unit and remote control are laid out well and easy to use. There is an oscillation feature that directs the air to both sides of the unit so that a wider area of the room is cooled. A water level indicator on the bottom lets you see exactly how much water is in the tank, which is easy to fill through a small door on the side. The only problem is that it does not cool as I expected it to. On a 100 Degree day, it only managed to lower the temperature to 94 degrees and that was on the highest blower setting. I expected at least a twelve degree difference.|Negative
This evaporative cool (small swamp cooler) has bee just right for our back yard area. We add some cold water and it gives us enough cooling that we can stand the Texas heat for an afternoon cigar for my husband. The water level gauge was unexpected but works fantastically. Well worth the $.|Positive
Looks nice, cools fair in 110 degree temps, is not maintance friendly takes 2 people to put outside cover back on. our water is bad here and the pads do not last 5 years and are very costly!!and having trouble finding pads. Would not buy again. company needs to test units here in Arizona.|Negative
Worked fine.|Positive
Works great! Price was right.|Positive
Cooler was easy to assemble. I use it in my garage and it works well keeping me cool and that is saying something, because the average outside temp in our area is 108 to 115 degrees.|Positive
I love everything about this unit except the hose hook up. They need to beef ot up better..If honeywell improves that part of it then they knock it out of the park.|Positive
I have the swamp cooler pads replaced every fall when the cooler is winterized. The clean dry pads provide some cold weather insulation until spring startup. When in use, this all natural product works really efficiently and (if you can smell it at all) gives off a pleasant aroma.|Positive
I live in Texas and it's pretty much impossible to survive with some sort of ac unit. I'm so glad I was able to get this fan. It's so lightweight so it's easy for me to take from room to room and I like that you can add water to cool the air. My only regret with this fan is not getting it sooner! I highly recommend it. You can't beat the price.|Positive
Fast delivery and well put together.|Positive
The abs type material in the water pan and on the pad sides make a big difference in how long the cooler will last from the water. I tared my old one, which made it for 14 years. I tared the entire interior as I don't like buying one every few years. I hope to never buy another one, except for the pads.|Positive
Perfect fit. Had no problems with installation.|Positive
Snaps on, fits and seals perfectly|Positive
The pillow is nicely made but easily fits in a 20 x 20 inch duct. It would work better in a 19 x 19 inch to seal off the duct but a lot nicer to handle than the fiberglass I normally use.|Positive
I bought this cooler 2 days ago and installed it in the living room the same day. We've been having a heat wave here in Northern Arizona with temps over 100 so I needed some fast relief. Window install using provided hardware was very straightforward and simple. It took me about two hours by myself. Yes, this unit includes the water pump (I wasn't for sure on that till I got it home). My little one bedroom house is about 750 sq ft., and this cooler has made a VERY noticeable difference... Ahhh ;-) What I really wanted to respond to was the noise factor that others have mentioned; on the first day I noticed that this unit was quite a bit noisier than other evap coolers I have lived with, but then today i was inspecting the plastic louvres on the front grill. They are a little loose and are made that way so you can turn them to adjust the direction of the incoming air flow. However, they do vibrate with the wind pressure coming through the unit. This is where the excessive noise is coming from. So, if you buy this unit, just play with the louvres on the front grill till you get them set into a position where they don't vibrate. I used a little piece of scotch tape on one blade to hold it in place and that seems to work fine. This unit does meet my expectations and I would buy it again as well as recommend it to a friend ;-)|Positive
Seems to work.|Positive
These fit a little tight into my Breeze Air but seem to be working fine. Conditioned air is nice and cool. The nasty smell lasts for a few days so make sure you run the swamp cooler as much as you can for the 1st week.|Positive
We have had this evap cooler for about a month now and it works extremely well. If you want to save money and still be comfortable this summer I would suggest you run out and buy this!!!|Positive
Great cover, sturdy and good quality, protects AC really well|Positive
Excellent product for my cooler.|Positive
Exactly as advertised. Perfect dimensions, perfect fit.|Positive
I bought the first motor at Lowe's and the motor was loud and the bearings went out after about a month so I returned it and got a refund. I bought the second motor at Home Depot and it turns out it was the same motor, different brand name (Dial). Same problems, loud and the bearings went out after about a month and a half. I returned it and bought the more expensive 1/2 hp motor, so far no problems. DO NOT BUY THE DIAL MOTOR! Spend the extra ten bucks and get the better quality motor and save yourself the hassle of replacing the motor after a month of use.|Negative
This is an excellent portable cooler. I use it in the laundry room and it keeps it nice and cool.|Positive
product okay--packaging wadded up mess left pads with aspen strewn in bottom of box - I bought cooler at store and now last two years , no pads available except online. One shipment two years ago came okay no issues. Last year and this year pads were wadded up ,creased and aspen beaten out of them-------- PLEASE just stock on the shelf, otherwise a new supplier is probably my only answer. NOT Happy!!!|Negative
This evaporative cooler is so easy to use. There's literally no hard work involved. I am so thrilled to own it. Everything about it is perfection! It cooled my bedroom super fast and is so quiet you can hardly hear it. I love the portability factor as well. It's so easy to move from room to room. I like it much better than AC because it has lots of functionality and you can easily control what temps you need. I'm super exicited to own it and I know it's going to bring us many years of use and save us money too!|Positive
Water level float didn't work, and water drip system only wet half the media. Also unit is very loud. When returned to Home Depot, service attendant did not ask me if anything was wrong with unit. So i think i might of bought something that someone else returned.|Negative
This is a different swamp cooler than I am used to, but that's not bad. It certainly has some advantages over the usual big box types. Here are the pros and cons. Pros: Nice looking, especially outside the house Easy assembly Everything worked right out of the box Very quiet on the outside of the house I like the plastic construction I thought the instructions were very good Cons: This has a bleed off system that was a problem in my installation. I had to disable it. The inside of the unit is very large and the louvers are not adjustable It's loud inside the house, but they all are It leaks. It's just not possible to keep some water form escaping when it is in operation It remains to be seen if it will cool the 1150 sq ft house I installed it in. I'm also skeptical of how long the evaporative pads will last. With my location it's just not possible to use a bleeder or a purge pump so I'm going to try draining it every couple weeks to see if that will keep the water fresher. I'll provide an update this fall.|Positive
AS I guestimated this pump puts out more water volume to the 8 lines over the cooler pads,especially on those 90-100 degree days.Everyone with a swamp cooler no matter what size should use it!|Positive
I purchased this cooler for my bedroom, it did not cool the room enough, I even placed solid ice cubes in the water bin area without luck. I didn't notice any decrease in temperature only increased humidity. HD was great in it's order delivery and they didn't give me any problems whatsoever in returning it at the store.|Negative
Just connected it today and am using it now. Having to leave the product near an open door or window allowing the hot air to come in combats the cooling of the product, but it definitely is cooler than a fan. It is noisy however, like a standard fan or air conditioner. But it is working and it does cool the entire space (room) you are in unlike a fan that cools you if you are in its path.|Positive
I am very satisfied with the evaporative cooler. It has the ability to cool an entire room in a short time. With the outside attachment to water supply, it works so well for me to have a cool house all day or just in the evening when I come from work.|Positive
I use it in my garage, its gets really hot in there during summer months, I point the cooler on me and it blows nice cold air on me as I work. It doesnt drastically change the room temperature to like 70 degrees, but still its pretty refreshing and quite effective|Positive
Lightweight, easier to deal with than canvas, open at one corner for ease of installation. Hopefully it will last as long as canvas cover it replaced & be a good an insulator.|Positive
4 bedroom house is cooled on low speed. Very dry where I am and helps increase moisture. Been running for 2 months and so far so good. Make sure you leave a little play at the flange for the vent cover. It has to be able to snap into place. There is little tolerance for the clips.|Positive
Only tried in outside shed and found it worked chilling the air a little but the instructions of the dial control were wrong.|Negative
This cooler was fairly easy to install, it took about an hour. It actually keeps our 1800 sq ft home very cool, I think almost too cool at times. My husband loves it because he is always looking for the perfect cooling system. I think he has found it!|Positive
unable to read thermostat without bending over very far|Negative
I like the twist off bottom for easy cleaning. Pump runs great.|Positive
It leaks water from over spray. If you regulate the water down it does not get the media wet enough to cool.|Negative
Excellent product, easy to put on, served purpose real well. Thanks|Positive
This thing is remarkable! Temp was in the 90s and my upstairs room was cool as a cucumber. I did have to open the back when it was delivered. The pump was on its side and needed to be set upright. But it was a piece of cake. 12 thumbs up!|Positive
I'm not quite sure what evaporative coolers are meant to do but this did not cool my room. In fact made it extremely humid. Got it to like 70% Humidity and with humidity it cannot be cold so just sitting in from of the cooler feels nice but I don't think this is meant to COOL a room.|Negative
Our evaporative cooler wasn't working, the pump it came with was frozen and couldn't move. We tried this one and it was a perfect match to what it came with and works great. Easy to put in, too.|Positive
This was the closest size to what Ineeded. Otherwise fits my my ac unit|Positive
It comes with everything you need, is simple to change, and blows hard on high.|Positive
Unit has worked as promised. Live in very dry area, cooler is effective. Water is hard, will have to clean frequently. I have read instructions, sounds a bit difficult to clean.|Positive
Easy to install & works fine.|Positive
it was OK|Positive
worked perfect on craftman lawnmower|Positive
Perfect replacements. Installed in just a few minutes|Positive
We bought this for a small Automotive repair shop to help with the soaring temperatures that have reached nearly 120 degrees Fahrenheit during this summer, 2016. The only thing we noticed is that you have to use a water pressure regulator on the water intake so that you don't damage the automatic water fill up. We have notice 30 degree temperature difference when measured on the air that is coming off the unit and we love this thing. We may have to get another one of these just because it has helped so much. JFY our shop is in Brevard County Florida!|Positive
I used my Evap Cooler outside AZ.Room for my Pets during these Hot Summer times. It was a life saver. It Cooled my AZ Room 230 sqft. Area. Very comfortable. Those are the pros. The Cons: once u fill the Water level at first I thought Wow its pretty cool it hasen't used up the water. The level showed it was more then half full. As I walked into the AZ room, the room was pretty warm. When I went to ck the water level by opening the side latch. The level to the water dropped all of a sudden, showing it had no water. So yes the water level on occasion gets stuck to the full position in more cases then not. But I've learned that if I fill it to the top level it takes about 4 hrs. Before I have to fill again to be on the safe side. I was hoping that maybe one fill would at least last 8 hrs. Over all other then the lever getting stuck and needing a better method of being affective. Its a great Little Evap. Cooler does its job very effectively 4 hrs at a time.|Positive
The last one i had only lasted about 8 years I hope this one goes longer. The last one rotted out where the float hooked on and allowed the water to run down the roof. This new one is louder than my old one.|Positive
Easy to install drilled 1 small because old one would not come out bought 2. 1 for the shelf|Positive
fit well and worked as expected. very good construction|Positive
As this was installed after the season was over, it is difficult to evaluate actual use because there has not been any use yet. Installation went well to the best of my knowledge as it was professionaly installed. Unit looks good and I anticipate good results. Store personnel were excellent in helping with the purchase of this unit and the followup after it arrived. Worked with three employees in Customer Service and I would rate all of them Very Good. My compliments.|Positive
I am tired of everything being so cheap. I noticed that the old champion cooler I replaced was better made. The filter panels are of lower quality than my old Champion. The filter panels were screwed in with self taping screws. When you remove them there is now untreated metal that will rust. Two of the panels didn't fit correctly into the unit. A section of the top was pushed in. The louvers on the filter panels are very sharp. I cut my fingers trying to get the panels to fit right in the unit. I am disappointed with with this unit. To be fair, the unit works.. Take a look at one before you buy it. I will see over time if the unit was worth thew money.|Negative
Unit comes assembled except for wheels. We really love this swamp cooler. I use it in my 30 x 40 garage. It is bringing down the temps 10`. It can use up to 50 gallons of water a day if you run it constantly thru the day. Well worth the comfort though. Unit is a slim not boxy. Will fit against the wall when not in use. 3 Speed fan is powerful and we normally just use low speed. Great value for a unit this big. I shopped a long time before I found this one. GET IT NOW....|Positive
This review is written at home depot's repeated requests to write a review. I wrote a review and home Depot refused to publish it because it had honest information on how home Depot performed very poorly. The unit provides a cool breeze in South Carolina's humid and hot August weather. I recommend the unit. It's a shame home Depot doesn't publish accurate reviews about the complete purchase experience. Home Depot will NOT improve until they acknowledge and own their problems. Home Depot is overdue for a management replacement.|Positive
Very disappointed. The pump didn't work. It was brand new|Negative
I set this up the beginning of May in Denver, CO. It works great! Last year I had a portable evaporative cooler that was horrible (It would just circulate hot humid air.. yuck). DO NOT BUY A SWAMP COOLER IF YOU LIVE IN A HUMID PLACE THEY DO NOT WORK IN HUMID PLACE (FL I'm looking at you!). Not much to setup (Other than running a water line). Easy to setup and I haven't had to service it yet but it looks simple to clean and maintain too. Fantastic! Highly suggest you get one before the summer hits you in the face!|Positive
Takes the edge off the warmest days in the Seattle summer. The timer and two included freezer packs are thoughtful features. After running my unit daily for several months I ran into an issue with the water pump not detecting water. However I got an email from Ashley and was able to fix it with a simple remedy. It was working as good as new again.|Positive
The water flows very well. We'll see how long it lasts.|Positive
Two rooms in our house don't get the benefit of air conditioning, and this cooler had made a huge difference in the hot weather.|Positive
This really helps keep room cool. So far so good even during monsoon season with the humidity up quite a bit.|Positive
I like this cooler alot , i have 2 of them, 1 in my trailer and 1 in my AZ room. they keep both room so cool in the summer and the cost od running them is great. Its like running 2 fans|Positive
product looks well put together runs good.|Positive
I had to return the 1st one , 2nd one has the same issue after less than a months use .. this is ludicrous - just shows you name Honeywell means not much anymore. That's what happens when its made in China and I am in America.|Negative
"I don't know where to begin to tell you how great this ""swamp cooler"" works. It's 108° outside, but idoors feels like 77° all thanks to this cooler. It's not that loud compared to other evaporited coolers and its not too big. I am very happy with it. You must, must get one for yourself."|Positive
"Out of the gate, it runs as expected and the volume of water it pumps is good. For the volume of water it states that it pumps, it had at the lowest price when comparing the pumps offered at the Home Depot I shop at. How long will it last? I do not know as I have only been using it for a couple of months. Am hoping that it will last for more than one summer, but time will tell... I give it 5 stars and recommend it solely due to the couple of months that it has worked well. If it ""dies"" before this summer is over, I will have overrated it."|Positive
We replaced the old Champion swamp cooler with the same version and what a difference. The new Champion produces one tenth the noise of the old one and takes about 40 minutes to cool our 1,200 sq ft home versus 2 hours. We are very satisfied with this products performance.|Positive
great product the only problem so far is the hole nozzle wont tighten on the unit. It worked fine and now it just spins and spins and wont tighten so we have to put water in via bucket, which takes time.|Positive
Amended to my review on 8/26/2013. Purchased in May of 2013 and the motor burned out in September 2013. Would not buy this brand again. Can not find replacement part for the motor. The pump still works but the fan will not turn although you can hear the motor. While running in September, the unit suddenly popped the circuit breaker. After that the fan would only run slowly. This year took it out to look at it and research parts and the fan does not turn at all. We have a unit from another manufacturer that has worked fine under the same circumstances and is still working this year.|Negative
They were larger than I needed so I cut 3 inches off the top and they work great|Positive
Fit nicely looks good|Positive
Really cooled well for 1000 sqft, 15+ degrees cooler then ouside temp. Did go through water faster then expected, but not a problem|Positive
Never got to use it. It did at work. It wouldn't even turn on. I took it back to the store for a full refund. It was a fast and easy transaction at the store for the refund|Negative
There evap pads, not rocket science. The box they were shipped in was as thin as paper so they arrived cracked. They were loose in the box so they were beat up.|Negative
We are on our 4th Mastercool in 30 years and appreciate the performance over the longevity. HD coordinated our last replacement and it went smoothly @ $300. This one, not so much. The new contractor offered to replace the unit for $2600! I declined the offer and found someone else for $500 plus the cost of the unit. The new unit has an odd smell which I was told is a result of the coating on the medium and should go away eventually.|Negative
I bought this cooler so I could pursue my woodworking hobby in my garage. I live in the Phoenix area and our temps this summer have been between 108 and 115. I have been able to cool the garage down to 88-90, which I can handle. Obviously this type of cooler also increases the humidity. The unit seems to be well made and I have no complaints about the construction. I like the built it swing function that keeps the air moving. I would recommend this as long as you understand that it is NOT an air conditioner. It does what it is designed to do. If I wanted to spend $5,000 I would install an actual air conditioner and be more comfortable.|Negative
I had a friend install the new motor and it only took about 15 minutes or less! It works GREAT!|Positive
Works fine until the motor goes out. CAN NOT find a replacement motor anywhere. HD should not sell items without replacement parts. PIECE OF JUNK>|Negative
The fan works great but despite my every attempt to get it to cool my room down, it did not. I’m taking it back.|Negative
Keeps one room about 80 82 degrees the rest of the house is 95 plus|Positive
Thought that maybe the motor on the cooler was going out. Ended up just being the bearings were bad and no longer freely spinning. Swapped the old ones out with these and it works perfectly now. Hopefully, I'll have a cheaper electric bill this month.|Positive
Love this cooler could be a little cheaper.|Positive
Provides cooling and humidity for a 100sq ft greenhouse.|Positive
not much to add here as this is the only correct part for the CM70 evaporative cooler; this is the stock OEM pad and it restores the performance to brand new|Positive
I bought this pump last year to replace the original pump that came with my Champion window, evaporative cooler. That pump, and the pump that originally came with my first window cooler (I've owned two), both lasted approximately 5 years. This replacement pump lasted only one year. I decided to read the reviews to see if it was just me, but I see several other people have had the same problem. I came home this morning after having worked all night to a hot house. Right now my dogs and I are NOT happy; it is 88 degrees outside, and 80 degrees inside the house. I have to pick one up as quickly as I can from my local HD, but this is the only brand they sell. I wish they sold another brand.|Negative
Installed easily and was simple to adjust.|Positive
Easy|Positive
Great product. It be perfect if it had wheels but i love it.|Positive
Although it is cheaper than buying from Mastercool, I found the effectiveness is not as good as before replacement of the original pad. Design difference? Not sure, but in the long run this will end up costing more.|Negative
So far so good|Positive
I bought this unit to cool a sunroom. It does a great job of keeping the sunroom comfortable. I love that it is portable, so easy to move. We use it in all rooms of the house even though we have central ac. I have recommended this cooler to friends and will continue to do so.|Positive
Very good, used the old ones for over three years so was time to change them|Positive
very well made and installed with no problems. very happy that it is also very straight when turning.|Positive
The product works well as advertised. The top fill location is in the shape of a shallow bowl/funnel but the sides should a little steeper to keep the water from sloshing out when pouring water in to fill it. It does cool the interior OK but be aware the added humidity can make the apparent temperature not as cool as the thermometer says.|Positive
When I opened the box, I thought they were way too thin.... Turns out they were an exact match and they actually cover better than the factory installed ones, if you place them right.... I will be replacing these pads more often at this price...... 95F outside, 70F inside !!!!!!|Positive
I have been using this cooler everyday for past few months and I love it. It gives a cooler fan which cools down my bedroom especially when I can't sleep with windows open. It's not air conditioning cold but it's definitely cool air that blows all night long. Follow directions and it will work! Love that it's portable and i can use it as a fan too!|Positive
Better then expected. Nice Velcro strip on side for better fitting.|Positive
I used the firsst year during the summer months when the heat is the highest. at the end of the seaon I cleaned it for the next year and when I went to use it the second year the pump woukld not work and whn I asked for another pump I was told that I would have to pay for it as the waranty is good for 1 year and they meant the one year I had it not the fact that I only used it for the sumer saeson which was about 4 months so it cost me almost $100.00 for anew pump. In original install it took me 4 different units to find one that was not cracked I was told that they were damaged in shipment. Also to contact the company for any help is very difficult. Also any parts you may need are very expensive and shipping costs make them more expensive.|Negative
it cools okay and is not noisy auto float dose not work at all it flooded my shop twice. so if you buy just keep in mind that you will have to fill it by hand|Negative
I put this fan in my master bedroom as it is on the side of our house where the sun hits all day long. We live in Southern California so the heat is real. That room is like a hot box by the middle of the day. This fan helps so much! Absolutely love the evaporative cooling feature as well. It helps to cool down the room. The different fan settings are also great. I personally don't mind a loud fan as I like to sleep with some sort of white noise anyways but I like the fact that it also has a sleep setting in case you need it to be quiet for some reason.|Positive
This pump was easy to install and works great for my wall unit|Positive
It works well for about 1000 sq ft warehouse but not 1600 sq ft. But it's the best evaporative coiler for that size and price.|Positive
Fast shipping, the order came on time, easy to install|Positive
Work great!|Positive
I have a 8 x40 travel trailer and this barely helps.Not Much Better than A Fan.Would Not Buy Again.|Negative
After reading reviews that claimed this would help to cool a room in conjunction with central air in more humid climates, I bought it hoping to cool my bedroom at night only to deal with the dreaded night sweats! It does not cool as much as I had hoped for, but just running the fan on low has helped to ease them somewhat. I do appreciate the ionizer feature.|Positive
It was the same as the original, works great.|Positive
We have a 3 story house with about 1000 SQFT per level. Last summer and the start of this summer, we had been running three window AC units to keep the house cool. The electric bills were heading toward $200 to keep the place cool and we had to always be careful about keep the cool in/heat out. After reading some reviews here, we decided to buy this unit. I wish I had not waited!!! This unit cools our top two floors nicely at 1/4 the cost. We put it at the top of our steps and use a box fan to direct the cool air downstairs during the day and into our upstairs bedroom at night. the reason it is so great in Colorado is that Xcel energy will pay for the ENTIRE cost of the unit if you buy the purge pump too. It is on the approved list for a $600 rebate. Total cost was about $550 with the pump = basically free. Installing on the second floor was a challenge because of the way you have to hook up the water, but if you plan to put this in a first floor window it should take about 2 hours tops. My only complaint (and it is minor) is that our insect population has gone from zero to a couple of small flies around the house everyone once in a while. They like the moisture and get drawn through the unit. If we installed this on the first floor, I would put a mesh cover over it to eliminate this issue. Having it on the second floor limits our options on this front.|Positive
I'm a new man! I finally got a good nights sleep without tossing and turning and sweating in the heat. This cooler is excellent. Not wanting to spend thousands on central air along with the higher energy costs/consumption of it, I sprang for this evap cooler and it is cool cool cool. Disclosure: I'm really handy with tools (not a contractor) but I can do electrical, plumbing... but be warned this unit is a bit of an involved install. Things like preferred placement and proper sized vents/ducts aren't in the manual. It ain't rocket science but still, it would be nice to have more info from the manufacturer. I chose to cut a hole in the wall and formed my own duct and then used a 16X16 return air conditioning grill on the inside. Came out real nice. Note: because of this type of install the fan blower is LOUD inside the house. Better than sweating and after enjoying a night of TV with cool air and then getting the best night sleep in months, I can live with the noise level. I may cut an intake filter for central A/C units to use as a noise baffle and add some extra air filtration. This is a good commercial grade unit. If you're handy working with tools and don't mind the extra maintenance evap coolers require, you'll be happy. If you have more money than time, call an HVAC company and let them do it. And kudos to Home Depot for even carrying this equipment. Out here in So. Cal. try and source these from anywhere else without a contractors license. Ya can't!|Positive
I love cool in my room|Positive
Filter worked very well. Easy to replace in the ac.|Positive
Material was much thinner than in the past. Ended up covering the evaporative cooler twice.|Negative
This cooler works well, but when first turned on, it has a tendency to spit droplets of water. It is easy to fill, but odd to figure out in the beginning. The entire water bucket will slide out if you reach in and elevate the take up hose. That is a plus for cleaning, but it not a good idea to remove it to fill as it is hard to get it back in without spilling water. It does cool well and you can easily add ice to the water basin. The design is nice looking. I think it is overpriced.|Negative
This is an awesome cooler, I just love it. Love having a remote. Love having the 2 speeds.. I use it a lot on the low speed. It really does keep my mobile home so cool. On high it will freeze your bum off. I have 2 of these coolers. I also purchased the grill cover for them from Champion. I highly recommend this cooler.|Positive
Works really well to cool room, Easy to use. We use a quart container to add water a little at a time. Float on side viewing window moves easily if tap the side to get a more accurate reading. Lasts for several hours once filled.|Positive
These straps have plenty of length to them and seem to made of decent material that will last a long time before fraying in the weather. I have only taken these out of the box and have not used them because i am using my evaporative cooler now with it being summer. They are super easy to use and like how they are easy to tie down. They should last a long time|Positive
Bought this pump on 7/25/12. Installed 8/1/12. Used for 6 weeks and then the entire 2013 season. Worked good for 2 weeks of this 2014 season and just stopped working. I expected it to last longer than that. It worked well when it worked. I guess it's off to get a replacement now. :(|Negative
I think this does cool down the air, but I feel like 10 degrees at most. I live in Southern California & this summer has been somewhat more humid than usual so perhaps that's why. I'm going to keep it though because it works as an above average fan.|Negative
When I initially started reseraching this product the advertising said that it cools 850 sq feet and it can be used in an inclosed space. When I got it home and I read the manual it did not work at all. I am in a desert environment with very low humidity so it should have worked. I read the manual and it said it works well with the door/window open AND.... best use is when you are sitting next to it.That is not 850 sq ft. It is very loud as well. Finally, as a note to the items condition, the manufacturer sent me an item that had 1 large crack in the plastic, it was superficial and my concern was the function but it utterly failed in that department.|Negative
Perfect unit for our place. Remote is great addition.|Positive
Swapped out a pump that had died. Totally blown away, no pun intended, with how much of a difference this pump made. My cooler is now running way less and keeping my house cooler! Wish i had swapped it out at the beginning of the summer.|Positive
I ended up replacing my old HAVAC unite with a new one. This cooler is just taking up space on the wall. I do not recomend it at the sq.ft. it is rated for. I am very unhappy with this product!|Negative
The fit dimensions are generous which allows for electrical conduit and water line connections. Initial assessment is that it is good quality canvas and very reasonable in price compared to other local stores.|Positive
It's an easy replacement to keep the cooler running|Positive
"The temperature in my 220 square foot room room was 83 degrees. Per directions, I sat the unit in front of an open door, and opened a window opposite the unit. I filled the unit with water, and put ice in the top. I set the unit the ""cool"" mode and turned it to ""high"". Over three hours later, my front room was still 83 degrees - and A LOT MORE humid. ""WET"" doesn't equal ""COOL"". If I wanted to live in a swamp, I would move to the Everglades. I will be returning the unit to Home Depot."|Negative
"In-wall installation instruction includes ""have installed by a contractor"" and that's pretty much it. I installed it myself and it works good but it is very noisy, even on low speed. The remote only works if you stand or hold it higher than the units control panel and has a 15ft range limit."|Positive
This pump works as it should - nice flow and quiet.|Positive
Its great, it refreshes the area with a decent noise from the fan. It has a huge tank for the water. I have others, which are also good but this one seems to work better. Its probably because water is mixed with the air blowing, so it seems, as I have to refill often.|Positive
Wish I had bought this 2 years ago when the price was lower. But don't regret the purchase at today's price. Has dropped my garage temperature an average of 23 degrees. This combined with a ceiling attic duct has made the Arizona summer temperatures in my garage tolerable. Humidity levels hovering around 42% RH. Love the remote because it makes control adjustments so easy. The slim design works great outside the garage without impeding the walkway. Again, this is perfect, and at a fraction of the energy cost that air conditioning would have cost.|Positive
I fit just right with one exception. Our cooler hangs with 2 chains on the upper rt & upper lf and there were no openings for those. But since it really didn't affect the use it was fine.|Positive
This Thermostat works great. I replaced a Dial brand thermostat with this Mastercool and it works as intended. I strongly suggest installer have some basic electrical experience under their belt for this job.|Positive
Does a pretty good job of cooling down a small space. Has helped us manage the hot temperatures.|Positive
We LOVE this machine in Austin TX. We are using it in the outside back porch and it works great with direct house connection. Highly recommend !|Positive
This cover fit the condensate unit perfectly and was secured with its' integrated tie down cords. I did however use a tie down strap wrapped around the unit over the cover in the event of a major wind storm. It is holding up well.|Positive
We just bought this pump last month, and it already went out.|Negative
Works okay, except for the remote.|Positive
the cooler pump works great. it last along time and is a good value|Positive
Product worked. Does not include basket.|Positive
Does the job. Evap cooler back up and running like new.|Positive
I have had these coolers for last nine to ten years, the older units were rusted so decided to put new ones. I was little disappointed to see no improvent done on the units for last ten years. But still recommend them if you want cool down a bigger area without the extra cost.|Positive
This unit actually seems to heat the air not cool it. The temperature on my window where this is pulling air from was 72 this morning and the air coming out was at the coolest spot 74. How is that possible? My older unit which this replaced would have been putting out 60 degree air. I buy these mostly as a low cost humidifier (Las Vegas, where the humidity, err lack of, is very often under 10%). Another thing is that I've noticed that this unit sometimes leaks water when filling it, maybe due to the rate or direction the water is going so you really need to have a pan under this to avoid water on your floors. I plan to return this to HD.|Negative
it helps to move the air around in small room adding iced water helps|Positive
Did not cool even a small room.|Negative
Excellent using it as an indoor air-conditioning|Positive
The cover fit perfectly! I recieved it right in time, it’s durable material.Absolutely recommend this to anybody !!!!|Positive
I have two of these units that didn't last one Arizona summer, both are within one year of the manufactures made on date. Although Esssicks will replace the unit within the warranty period providing you have the receipt-- there is no support for beyond that-- no parts replacements-- no service manuals no nothing. These units are good for one summer only they are in essences disposable units, don't waste your money on cheap products that are only a temporary solution. BUY USA.|Negative
Was easy to install works great|Positive
It was all it was suppose to be , and cheaper than other stores.|Positive
I live in a hot and arid locale, and I am familiar with evaporative coolers, unlike other reviewers who do not know enough to leave a window open. This unit will not make the room overly humid, it will make the air comfortable. It is relatively quiet; the blowing fan is the only noise. The water tank is huge, which is great. My main problem is that is doesn't cool the air very much. It will bring the temperature down about 5 degrees or so, but that is it. It seems like it should do more than this for a 200 sq ft room.|Negative
I bought a cheaper water cooler pump by mistake. I took it back and swapped it out for this one with a higher GPM. It cost more; but you get what you pay for so they say.|Positive
It beats a blank. It is blowing air and that is what was needed.|Negative
"Hessaire is a little over optimistic about their 1,600 sq.ft. rating for this unit. For that to be valid it should have a 6,400CFM blower rating, about 21% greater than its actual 5,300CFM rating. Nevertheless, this unit does an excellent job of cooling 1,325 sq.ft. on LOW and 1,520 sq.ft. on HIGH. The design has been well thought out, although the workmanship (though acceptable) is rather crude, just about what you'd expect from ""Made in China"": some plastic seams don't exactly fit, and all the metal work (caster wheels & supports) looks crude, but functional. The 4 large caster wheels make it very easy to move around, even when filled with almost 120 pounds (14.6 gallons!) of water! Curiously, there isn't much noticeable air velocity between the LOW and HIGH settings, although the fan motor current numbers hint that the LOW air volume might be about 85% of its HIGH setting rating, or about 4,500CFM. Some points the MFC6000 Owners Manual do NOT mention, but SHOULD include: (1) The water float-value is NOT intended to operate with more than 45psi water pressure (most municipal water is 60-80psi and some can be up to 100psi!), so you WILL need to use an in-line RV water pressure regulator when operating from an outdoors water bib (spigot). However, this is not a problem if you pour the water in through the front flap-door. (2) The four installed Xcel50 pads will eventually need to be replaced, but nowhere does it mention their sizes; are they 'stock' sizes or must they be custom ""trimmed"" to fit? (3) When the water tank is run down to empty, the water pump will run ""dry"" because there is NO ""out-of-water"" sensor switch. You turn the pump ON and you turn it OFF."|Positive
disappointing|Negative
All works well|Positive
This 470 CFM 4-Speed Indoor Portable Evaporative Cooler with Remote Control for 280 sq. ft cooler is perfect for our use. We have an Arizona room (screened in porch with 1/2 walls) that cannot be air conditioned due to the location and construction. My wife and I use it to blow on us and her mostly. The cool setting makes the temp of air noticeably cooler and the 3 fan speeds are adequate - 4th speed must be off. It seems to use about a gallon and one half of water in 45 minutes. This is a function of the humidity, temperature and fan speed setting. The fan is somewhat noisy, as you would expect for a unit that blows air through a wet filter. On fan alone it is a much better fan than our 3 other fans we have been using for comfort. We are very pleased with the cooler and it came fully assembled ready to add water and plug into wall outlet. Highly recommend for hot, non-humid areas. We are in Christopher Creek area of Arizona.|Positive
The cover is good, but a little too long, I have to fold it up.Other then that, it Fit very well.|Positive
I needed a fan because the way my room is position there is a buliding right in front of my window. But when the s un rises it directly into my room. My boyfriend has this same fan at his house. And I was shocked how even though his room was hot. When he turn it on it cooled the entire roo immediately. So I had to purchase one. I have not had 1 hot night since. Even though its going into fall, I stay in sunny California where at any given time the temperture will jump up.|Positive
One side pad came broke in half.|Negative
Yes it did as well as I expected but it did not change the humidity level as it said it wouldn't|Positive
Very quite. Top quality motor. This was easy to install, instruction are very specific. Will recommend this motor.|Positive
"This fan/ ""swamp cooler"" is NOTHING more than a fan! There is literally NO difference between the ""fan mode"" and the ""cooling mode"" which is supposed to act like a swamp cooler. I put the ice pack in there, cold water from the fridge, and an entire tray of ICE CUBES!! This made ZERO difference from the regular fan mode. Don't waste your money on this."|Negative
The pads are not near as thick as the original. So, I was a bit disappointed with the quality! I paid a little more thinking that they would be better, but was mistaken.|Negative
No assembly required, easy to fill and move around, (make sure to check if the locks on the wheels are on/off; it took us a while to notice and afterwards it was easier to move around) I would not recommend if you live where it's very humid, Buts it's a decent affordable and strong swamp cooler!|Positive
After having the cooler for about three months it has been worth every penny. I installed it in a back office of the house and even on the low fan setting it quickly cools off our ranch style house. It has easily dropped the temperature in the house eight to ten degrees depending on the setting. It was easy to put it with a few tools and some minor reworking of the window. So far so good.|Positive
It works. What I do I use a floor fan metal to have air circulation in the room. And put the luma on and it feels comfortable.don't expect this to be an AC type,well it cools the room the way I do it. and I live in CT. And I like it does not make loud noise. Great product.|Positive
The order was completed on time, as agreed|Positive
It was nice and tough material. Would last for years.|Positive
It quit working in less than a month. Do not recommend this product.|Negative
Better than I thought. Quiet and cool. Had a fishy smell first time I used it but smell was gone the second day once it ran a few hours. Air coming out of unit is about 15-20 degrees cooler even in this humid climate of Houston. Highly recommend|Positive
The portable cooler is exactly what I needed. It's easy to use. Fill the tub with water for 8 hours of cool air. I have it in a loft that's hard to cool.. perfect....|Positive
Good heavy duty cover|Positive
I like the brand and it was easy to install and works great. Good quality and also good price.|Positive
I bought two and the first one has already quit working within a month- my cooler is running almost 24/7 but should last longer Inbelieve|Negative
We live in Boulder, Colorado where humidity is extremely low and summers can get relatively hot. Our little 600 sqft apartment is on the top floor and reaches almost 90 degrees during the day (bleh!) and 85 at night. I bought this machine earlier in the year to replace an old evaporative cooler that worked like a charm. Running this monster on high (even with the ice adding feature) barely cools one 250 sqft room down to 80 degrees, which is not fun to sleep in. Not only does it not cool, but it is too frickin' loud and looks like a scary robot. Pretty bummed that we wont be able to return this $250 purchase. I highly, highly recommend not purchasing this product.|Negative
I bought this for a cabin that has solar power only.It uses very little electricity.The assembly and installation were fairly straight forward. The plastic filler panels to fill in the window gaps are useless. I ended up cutting some 3/4 whiteboard to fill the gaps.The build quality is disappointing and several of the screws were either loose or put in crooked.It seems to cool pretty well. I would recommend getting it out of the box and checking for handling damage before you take it home.The ones that were on the store shelf looked like the UPS guy delivered them and mine had several dents and dings.Worth the money for smaller houses or rooms.|Negative
Seems to work well.|Positive
I'll see how it holds up in the weather, but, I was totally pleased with the way it fit and the overall quality.|Positive
Biggest bang for the buck!|Positive
So sturdy- only wish it came in silver or gray. But very pleased with the quality. Thank you.|Positive
This is an amazing Evaporative cooler! The unit really performs well under any circumstances! Well worth the money and Highly recommended!|Positive
For the price, it has really junky on-off switches.|Positive
Our AC broke in April. We bought two of these machines and although they do not necessarily keep the room cool, they keep the air flowing nicely and when the heat and humidity is not as intense, they do give off a cool breeze.|Positive
Living in the desert means that it is hot and dry a lot. This product is EXACTLY what we needed. It is super easy to move it wherever we need it. From our home gym in the garage to our patio for bbqs, this works AWESOMELY for keeping us from getting overheated. Can't recommend it enough.|Positive
Exceeded my expectations! Used it in our 24' RV and it dropped the temps 15-20 deg from low 90's.Our two cats were very thankful for the cool air. Note that the control panel was a little flaky at the beginning but then started to work. We just disconnected power cord without using panel to off.|Positive
Pads are what I expected. Have 3 coolers to service and prefer aspen pads for their performance.|Positive
Seems like all evaporative coolers last the same amount of time, just made of thin guage sheet metal that rusts and easily warps and dents in shipping.The overall design of this cooler is excellent and it seems to be very efficient. Performance is good-quality is so so. Use a 1 hp motor. 3/4 hp barely enough to start fan spinning.|Positive
easy to install and only took a little over a hour to finish the job.|Positive
The first one did have a crack in the plastic frame, back to Home Depot for replacement, no problem. Installed the second one through a wall (in previous construction of wall allowed for the 22 x 22 opening this cooler needs), in less than one hour. Looks good, works like a charm, my $200 electric bills with A/C are now down to $30 a month in Southern California. Getting lower temperature out of this unit than my 4 ton A/C. I still will need A/C as backup during the more humid days, I know. But I feel this unit has already paid for itself after 3 months use! SCE also had a $200 rebate on this unit. Strongly recommend.|Positive
I gave y'all 5s! Don't push it.|Positive
Works great. I just wish the water reservoir was a larger capacity.|Positive
I purchased this Cooler 2 years ago. It's been a winner for those two seasons. However, when I unpacked the unit I found several screws missing from the water baffles. Also, when the motor was installed it appears the back bracket that holds the rear of the motor was installed to the motor before being secured to the bracket that supports the rear of the motor, big Red Flag. After replacing the screws for the water baffles and securing the bracket on the rear of the motor the Cooler has held up very well after doing general season cleanup and covering for the winter protection. I'm only giving this a 2-star rating due to the poor quality not insuring all the screws were in place and the fact the rear of the motor was not secured. Be aware to check all your nuts, screws and blots are in place and secure.|Negative
Works fine - takes the temp down about 10 degrees. Water compartment is a little hard to open and close. The ice containers don't seem to have any place to put them - instructions say in their compartments... It is easy to move around. I've had it about a month. It's not an air conditioner so don't expect cold air! Works even better with some bottles of ice in front of it.|Positive
Nice unit for a single room or in my case a 10 x 12 greenhouse.|Positive
This cover was the ideal size for the large downdraft (Champion 5000DD model) that I bought from Home Depot. There is a velcro closure up one of the vertical corners which is ideal for installation around the power flex conduit. I used two 1-inch wide inexpensive ratchet straps to wrap around the unit to prevent wind from messing with things over the winter. High quality looking canvas, I hope it lasts several years. I would encourage potential buyers to measure their units to ensure a snug fit.|Positive
after two or three weeks of use it smells bad and I had to clean it very often|Positive
Well made and efficient. Exceeds my expectations.|Positive
Worked great for a couple of weeks then quit working. I bought two so installed the second and it is still working after a month.|Negative
So even though I live in South Florida, I went ahead and purchased this to use in my garage pottery studio hoping to stay a little cooler and keep the humidity up for the clay. It's a great fan but as previously noted, it doesn't provide much cooling in a hot humid environment.|Negative
I had a 20 year old Champion evaporative cooler that I replaced with this same size updated model (per Champion this is the replacement). The older one had easy to use push in levers at each upper corner of all 3 panels. Just push in and top of panel falls gently forward then you grip the edges and lift panel out. Even a 61 year old handicapped woman could do this with great ease. The new one is screwed in so you have to get your drill screw driver out , keep your arms elevated to with heavy drill and unscrew both screws (per panel). The panel does NOT gently fall forward. there is a slot at the bottom for one hand only to lift up the panel. I am 5'3. I had to get a step ladder out to get higher than the slot in order to pull up. The panels sticks. with as much force as I could muster it still won't lift up so I had to call the neighbor over. this is the same on all 3 panels. Then the water line insert area! the old one was located at the back right corner. where it would not get bumped. The new one is on front right corner so anyone walking or squeezing by bumps it. No doubt the connector will be become loosened and the tube bent over time. THe water lines that come down from inside roof were not aligned and did not run into the V channels but out in between the pads and louvers, not getting the pads wet. these tubes are very hard plastic and can not be pushed even a little bit toward the inside so as to aim into the V channel, at least not with 61 year old arthritic hands. I had to get pliers to push them in, then lift panel back in place (UGH see above) to see if water was now going into correct location. also the float was set to high so the water drained out the overflow tube - yet another removal of the panel. The unit it self seems to work well but as far as ease of simple maintenance I would give it ONE star and not recommend it.|Negative
The Master Cool thermostat/controller was easy enough to install (had all the existing wire for previous thermostat and controller) but to install you will need a drill and wire strippers. There was no provision for plugging in the water pump into the controller - I had to cut the pump's plug off, strip the ends and then attach them to the controller's terminal block - no big deal, just thought they would have made provisions for a plug since all of the pumps I have seen have a standard wall plug. Also, you do have to look at the display from right in front of it - the display fades out from anything other than head on. Other than that, the unit has been working great this season and I like that the thermostat has a temperature display which the original unit did not have.|Positive
Great Product, works fantastic...|Positive
I have always used Arctic Coolers with much success. However this one does not produce much cool air at all. The room does not feel like I've used anything but a fan to circulate warm air, rather than a water cooler to produce cool air. Extremely disappointed.|Negative
I purchased this unit from the Home Depot website since it was on sale and I needed to replace my patio cooler. This thing is amazing. It is half the size of my former Master Cool and I really think it works better. I have not tried to take it apart to clean or replace pads as of yet. I am a little concerned with that aspect, however, at this point I am solidly giving five stars.|Positive
not quite OEM, generic configuration to fit several models, adiquete instructions|Positive
We live in Colorado. This unit worked great for two years. When I went to run it this week the pump quit working. It was great and even though it says 500 sq. ft. of cooling area we were easily able to cool an area larger than that. While the durability was terrible for the pump the rest of the unit was great. I do agree with the water fill indicator comments. I would probably recommend it to someone but only because I think that things are just not made to last anymore and two years is about what I figure these types of things will last for, sadly!|Negative
I just recently installed it for the first time. It fits well and was easy to put on my evaporative cooler (Breezair). No further comments as it is new.|Positive
"The assembly had a minor flaw, the blower fan section didn't perfectly fit into the cooler base so they forced it to fit and then drilled a new hole to screw in one corner, cosmetically looked bad. Also, this unit has a controller installed and it requires a 3-wire control line installation, sometime I won't do. So, I had to disassemble the entire wiring so it would be compatible with my existing 4 wire setup. The supplied wiring diagrams don't make this task easy because they don't provide the optional wiring configuration that I want to use, bypassing the supplied controller. I have enough experience to rewire the unit but those that don't will need to hire an installer. I liked the way it was easy to disassemble the unit… that allowed me to get it on my roof in pieces w/o hiring someone to haul it up to the roof. I recommend this cooler, it's replacing a 20 year old Mastercool 8""."|Positive
Unit works well for dry heat, not when the air is humid. You can tell when the air is humid as the water in the water tank does not diminish much. I fill the water tank with the provided ice packs, ice, and chilled water. When filled to the top of the water tank, the unit runs all night. Easy to transport from one room to another, and not heavy to lift over carpet. Not noisy; can hear the TV with the unit running nearby on higher speed. Also like the remote control. Called customer service about buying a 2nd unit, and getting replacement cooling pad and ice packs. Seymone was very helpful, patient, and courteous in guiding me with the transactions.|Positive
I had to cut the pads to get them to fit. The pads were not as shown in the picture on the Home Depot web site.|Negative
Motor failed after 2 weeks of operation.|Negative
it works ok just wish it was longer and did not require a spacer.|Positive
I wasn't home when the item was delivered. Found a pallet in my driveway with a damaged $1400 MasterCool apparently smashed from a forklift. Install was not difficult. Did it with the help of a friend. The PADS are absolute junk. This unit had been sitting for a long time in a warehouse I assume because the pads are extremely brittle. Impossible to install in the unit without them decaying in your hands. And they cost about $500. Never impressed with the quality and QA of home depot and not going to allow their poor customer Svc reps ruin my day or raise my blood pressure so, I didn't even call and complain. My methodology is to just not buy from them anymore. Anyway, I would not buy this unit again. The pads are poor at holding water and the water simply runs over the top of them and out the screen panel, onto my roof, staining my patio with calcium deposits. Yes, they're installed correctly :-)|Negative
To big and way to loud for what it puts out in cooling save your money, not worth it|Negative
It does exactly what it is supposed to do . Wish my local store stocked this item regularly (I got the last one, if I want more it has to be ordered from another store with the delay that implies.)|Positive
Great Cooler! Easy set up and works as advertised.|Positive
the only problem I found it is that it's kind of loud when you turn on the cooling feature on . othen than that works as described over all it's an ok. where you can save a lot of money vs an AC unit.|Positive
"Its not a tight fit but i imagine the engineers know more about the fit than i do. The instructions mention ""shrinkage"". The water was cold and all..."|Positive
This is a great machine that solved our problem of a very hot garage in the summer months. It took some adjustments to the inside to get it working correctly. The pump is very delicate and you have to be careful not to move the parts. It was not connected when it was shipped to us. All in all I would recommend it|Positive
Not overly powerful, but cost effective and efficient. Nice modern design, not boxy like most others.|Positive
This worked to replace the existing float on my Mastercool evap cooler|Positive
All parts included except motor. Easy to install since we already had one. We replaced our 25 year old one.|Positive
Extremely happy with the cooler. Cools a 700 sq ft space by 10 degrees within 45 mins. Love it.|Positive
We have an open livingroom kitchen area and this works great to take the edge of the heat around 3 PM on really hot days. It even reaches into the bedroom off the open area.|Positive
They fit as described. It’s winter so I’ll have to wait until summer to see if they perform.|Positive
There great !! Easy to use and many more uses !!!!|Positive
Fit well, high quality waxed canvas, sand up well in the wind.|Positive
The unit had a defective drain vale right out of the box, where it leaked on the floor constantly. Port-a-cool sent a new drain assy overnight. Excellent service. After the leak was fixed, the unit wouldn't cool the garage at all. This unit is designed for 500 sq ft area. My garage is 400 sq ft. This unit shouldn't have any problem cooling the garage. I ran it all day and still didn't cool. I plan on taking it back to home depot this weekend. I've had it two weeks.|Negative
I had to pay someone to install it, so that definitely added to the cost, and although I bought the 2 speed motor I currently have only a one speed switch (which is not the best way to operate the cooler). That being said, with the pump and the low speed wired to my one on/off switch, the cooler works really well. I bought the larger one and my mobile home is only 700 sq ft, so I'm sure that helps. On an extremely hot and dry afternoon, within five hours of turning it on, it was 66 degrees inside. I was very pleased. As a side note, I opened one window slightly to allow for the hot air to get out of the house.|Positive
The pads ordered came on time stated, were what I expected, easy to put in, and are effective in use.|Positive
Very nice tower cooler. Saves space for those small apartments and rooms. Easy-to-use and install. Works well with no noise.|Positive
very lightweight, easy to move around where needed, cools wonderfully|Positive
So far, so good.Thanks for checking,Robert L.|Positive
Very good cooling the space I purchased it for. Have recommended it to others as well|Positive
I'm glad I went with the larger size. The unit is quiet and, so far, is keeping my house cool. Since I don't have it hooked up to a thermostat yet and have used only the low cool setting, my house is staying around 72 degrees even when it's a little over 100 out right now.|Positive
The evaporative cooler works great. I'm considering getting another one soon.|Positive
This cover was just what I needed. It fits well, and protects the cooler just like it was designed to do.|Positive
I ordered this cooler online and picked it up at the store and was in and out within 15 min, what a great experience. It was also very easy to install and had everything needed for the installation. This was a very positive experience . thank you Home Depot|Positive
AS a seasonal swamp cooler user there have been times where we have needed to cool a bedroom off or my office off but can due to the swamp coolers location. Now I have a movable Frigidaire Evaporative Cooler and Tower Fan that really works!!! It came packed well and considering the size very lite. It is so lite that I can pick it up with one hand. I had nothing to put together ... I just plugged it in, added water and we are set. It cooled my office just delightedly and sweat free. I can do all my phone work with no one even knowing I have a cooler on in the same room. It is stylish and streamlined. Looks great in my home. I am a happy Frigidaire Cooler owner!|Positive
Perfect fit. Great product|Positive
Simple device, works well, just hard to find in the store.|Positive
One of the purposes of a vent is to remove moisture from your attic. If you trap moisture in the attic, you could cause significant structural damage to the roof deck.|Negative
High quality material and should last many years.|Positive
Super energy efficient and much easier to install than an industrial swamp cooler that requires a frame and a stand. This pushes so much air both as a cooler and simply a fan. It has decreased my insane 112 garage temperatures down to 78 in a matter of an hour. Works on a remote very well. I have my greenhouse one on a plug in thermostat, this unit functions perfectly in that fashion as well. Very well built and I highly recommend it.|Positive
A durable, functional unit; it controls the water level quite nicely. However, I was disappointed to see a cotter pin in the joint instead of a proper joint bolt. That cost you a star.|Positive
I bought this as a draining pump for my swampy. It is quieter than my normal pump and works fine.|Positive
It just was not strong enough for area I needed to cool down (work shed) had to return it|Negative
IT WAS EASY TO ADAPT TO THE OLD OPENING AND DOES A GREAT JOB|Positive
Easy to install light weight easy to get on the roof and takes no time to install|Positive
Living it a hard water area, all cooler pads quickly get choked up with calcium that sets like concrete. These filters were purchased to replace the originals that had been in there for five years. The install was pretty simple, although it needed the included foam spacers from my model that was a little awkward due to the breeze. Overall, they work well and provide must needed coolness in the Nevada heat. They are a good generic replacement for the aerocool filters at half the price.|Positive
It fit fine and was easy to install|Positive
After spending time preparing the cooler and adjusting the motor mount for the installation I removed the rear cover plate on the new motor to find that there were only 2 connection points. The marking and the connector for the high speed were missing. I had to return the unit to exchange it for another. Home Depot staff were fine about it but I wasted more than an hour's worth of time due to the manufacturer's poor quality control. Beware - when buying this motor. Bring a screwdriver, open the box and inspect the motor and connections before completing the purchase.|Negative
The home depot worker said this is cheaper and better than the big tan ones. Well it's not cheaper, it is harder to work on and more expensive. The replacement pads are 100 dollars, the replacement pump is 63 dollars, and the motor is outrageous. They say the pads last 5 years, nope mine did not, I got 2 years out of mine. The pump went out year 4 and you cant just stick another brand in there, has to be the same one to make it work, have to take back the I thought might work. Taking the cover on and off is a pain and plastic doesn't forgive like metal. Once it cracks no good.you have to the same pads. However I will say it puts out a good amount of air and is lighter and smaller. Overall definitely not worth it. I wish I could take it back.|Negative
It was easy to install|Positive
Product was very easy to assemble and works great besides the water gauge which is a off. Blows cool and great. Great buy for the price point.|Positive
These are junk. Just replaced one a month old with another that is a spare. And all you big box stores carry these things. JUNK! Looking for another brand. We replace these things every month or two all season long. JUNK!!|Negative
The picture shows three pieces, but the media is actually in four pieces (like the written description says). It doesn't seem to change the effectiveness of the cooler. If coming is four pieces instead of three keeps the cost down, I'm good with it. The media only came with five of the retention pegs, so be sure to remove the old ones carefully enough to reuse. After installing the media the cooler seems to blow air that is cool as I could hope based on all of the tables of temperature and humidity I've seen. This media is about half of the price of the stuff sold my the original manufacturer. Assuming the media lasts, it should be a good deal. Why not five stars? There really should be eight retention pegs in the package (two per piece of media). As long as your old pegs don't break, you should be good to go.|Positive
Just installed last week. The motor runs hot on high speed (draws high amp) and fine on low speed. It seems to have trouble on an 15-amp circuit breaker. The instructions say to widen the spool to permit a smaller diameter more closely matching the spindle diameter since I have do not have duct work ... just blown air directly through a wall mount. That spool widening helped minimally. The motor is designed to cut off at a certain temperature ... about 15 minutes for me. The belt is the right tension and the motor specs matches the old Sears motor. Not sure what to make of the situation. I installed a 20-amp circuit breaker but have not yet tested it at high speed.|Negative
Theis cover is made of a very good quality canvas and will be extremely durable during the winter months. I am very pleased with this cover and would highly recommend this item to anyone. Worth every dollar.|Positive
Modern features...easy to use...powerful fan/motor...quiet in action...easy to roll around...& priced affordably. Happy customer & quite surprised of this Evaporative Cooler 'Hessaire' product's fine performance.|Positive
I have no complaints. I was the best price I found, easy to install and works great. It does have a mild smell in the beginning but after the first use it goes away. I will definitely purchase again.|Positive
Great purchase, cools very well!|Positive
"These are not a ""universal fit"" leg - even though they are labeled as such. They do not fit a Champion or Essick Air 3000 or 3300 cfm down draft cooler without modifying the bottom pan edges (like with an angle grinder!). Also the radius bend in the leg that makes them for ""round corner"" coolers, does not match the radius of the cooler frame corner - so there is no cupping of the frame to provide stability. Summary: Very over-priced, spray-painted angle iron. Note that since Dial mfg. is the only game in town on cooler accessories, you take it or leave it."|Negative
This thermostat is really easy to use. It has a purge pump control that runs a second pump for five minutes every twelve hours to refresh the cooler water, if you choose to use this option - setting is adjustable I did find this digital screen needs to be viewed at eye level so make sure enough wire is run to do this. Takes work to properly install but well worth it. Great if you have pets.|Positive
I love this thing. Keeps my living room cool|Positive
This system proclaims to be a “cooler”. I should have trusted the other reviews. Look, if you’re looking for something that is going to output cool/cold air, this is NOT for you. It is just an overpriced fan. I live on the beach in SoCal where there is low humidity, took a chance. No go, move on.|Negative
I have used this unit for two outdoor parties in 90+ degree heat and the guests raved over how cool it made the patio. I was concerned that it would leak and make the patio slippery, but the unit kept the water contained even with the water hose connected and running. The unit does not refrigerate the air, so it is not cold like an air conditioner, but it moves a lot of water-cooled air without misting the guests or leaving a puddle in front of the unit. Last weekend, two of my friends ordered the same unit while they were at the party because they were so impressed with it.|Positive
we are now cool thanks to a top quality machine. way more air and cooler also.|Positive
Excellent-It met our expectations|Positive
works great and love it !!!|Positive
Heavy canvas covered with a waxy substance that should keep it waterproof for several years, it will leave a yellow mark if your shirt rubs against it, washes out. Shipping was unbelievably fast had it two days before the tie down straps I ordered arrived.|Positive
I purchased this for use in my 440 sf garage. The outside temps here regularly exceed 100 degrees, and the garage will get hotter than that in the afternoon, so the garage becomes stifling and hard to work in without the cooler. I placed the unit on top of a bench in front of an open window, and spent about 10 minutes rigging a simple block/seal on part of the window, so the fan grabs more of the outside, dry air, without the air blowing past the unit. I have only had this about a month, and have used it about 10 times, so I can't speak to the lomg-term reliability. I fill it manually with a hose or gallon jugs, and turn it on the low power setting about an hour before working in the garage. It cools well enough that I can work in the garage reasonably comfortably... don't expect it to get COLD, but it works as it should. As with any evaporative cooler, you need to open windows or roll up your garage door a few inches on the opposite side from the unit, so the moist/cool air can travel through the room, and moisture can exit. Otherwise it will just make your room steamy.|Positive
Very impressed. It is big and powerful, and gets the job done. Just a couple nit picky things. Putting the wheels on is kind of a chore. There are four screws per wheel assembly to deal with. Second, after putting in 2 gallons of water, the pump still sucks air. Also should have bigger panel screws.|Positive
Great swamp cooler! Had it assembled and working in a couple minutes. I use it pushed against my garage door that I close about 2/3 rds. Only a two car garage/shop but cooled it from 114 degrees to 82 in 10 minutes. Plus my wife will wheel it on the back patio when it’s 110 plus she loves it|Positive
Fit very well, came with all hardware. As good as the original if not better.|Positive
I use cool off bedroom. Keeps room cool. When not working room not cool.|Positive
Purchased this cooler for some relief from our heat waves in the SF bay area. Was very disappointed, it would spit out cold air, however does not cool down a room less than 250 sq ft. It works great if your sitting right in front of it.|Negative
It was easy to assemble. Directions were clear. And the product works as well as I expected.|Positive
This unit was almost ready out of the box. Just pluged in and filled the water tank kick back and enjoy thanks .|Positive
It is good for outside use , but on hot days it doesn’t cool my house down|Positive
perfect|Positive
"Item works well and moves a lot of water. Output tube is 3/4"". So if you're using on a 5000cfm unit or smaller, you will need a reducer barb to 1/2"" line."|Positive
So far the motor has held up. So far I haven't had much luck in buying parts for my swamp cooler. I had to go back alot to replace the parts I bought at Home Depot.|Positive
If you are expecting to cool down a whole bedroom this is not for you. I would describe this like a car A/C on medium and all vents on the driver. It’s enough for one person. Once you are not directly in front of it, you feel the warm air... Imagine being the passenger on a warm day and all the air conditioned vents hitting the driver. This works good for me at night, I like it cold. The house is at 79, but the evapolar brings it down to 70 (again right on me). I have tried ice water and there is no difference between using cold water and ice water. It does take a bit to get colder when using room temp water. I fill it up before I go to bed and keep a bottle of water next to it Incase I need to refill at night. It works as a fan when there is no water. If you keep on high the water goes faster, 3 to 4 hours. At medium it usually last throughout the night, about 6 hours. I am buying another for my sons room. BTW The light is really bright and is not a bad idea for a kids nightlight.|Positive
Pump works great so far!|Positive
Bearing works fine should be a stock item , took a few days to get , bolts on easy , add oil and presto|Positive
this unit works suprisingly well for it's size. the only complaint is that the remote only works in front of and fairly close to unit. Yea! waaah right?|Positive
On the low setting this thermostat heats itself up and never turns off. The temperature it is reporting is usually 10 degrees above actual ambient. It isn't ventilated enough to provide accurate temperatures. Don't waste your money! You are better off with an on off switch.|Negative
Really satisfied with my product.|Positive
Living in Salt Lake City means that it is hot and dry the majority of the year. This evaporative cooler is EXACTLY what we needed. I love that it is mobile so we can move it wherever we need it. We've just built a home gym in our garage, and this works AWESOMELY for keeping us from getting overheated. We also have used it on our patio during a barbecue so that we and our guests were comfortable. It is incredible the IMMEDIATE difference you can feel in the air when you use it. Highly recommended!|Positive
Nice cooler and seems well built. Hard to clean the pads and the tank without lots of disassembly.|Positive
works well in my cooler|Positive
Fits great, good price..|Positive
Filter lasts 5 yrs kinda expensive but better than every year replacements .|Positive
I notice that the picture show 2 small and 2 large evaporative pads. I recieved 2 small and only 1 large pad.Did I reveive an incomplete order? I have not install the pads yet, it is in the box.|Negative
We have a shop in Houston, Texas at an outdoor market. The shop space is a roll up door unit and before we purchased this port a cool we tried everything to cool it off in there and nothing worked. We even burned up 2 or 3 portable a/c units before we got this. This works great and keeps our customers comfortable and cool allowing them to stay and shop as long as they need to. We measured the temperature inside the unit and it dropped it between 15 and 20 degrees, even in Houston, Texas. If you are trying to beat the heat and stay comforatable I would highly recommend this product.|Positive
The primary thing to know, when purchasing cooler legs is your cooler housing square or round ? The legs work very well and are fully adjustable.|Positive
for the price it was awesome quality as well|Positive
bought this belt recently, it does not match the picture , picture makes it seem like it is reinforced with reddish Teflon coating, but is not . it is regular rubber belt.|Negative
Love that it has a huge tank to be able to fill with water and ice. Perfect when we had a heat wave recently. I love the style...not the usual boxy type.|Positive
Easy to install and works great . Has the pump the water tubing and all the cords and motor accessories needed .|Positive
It did stink the first two times we used it, but then the smell went away. We have a 1600 sq ft house and the portable swamp cooler is really good at cooling our great room. We don't get the best dispersion of the cool air, but I think that has more to do with our floor plan than it's ability. Love.|Positive
Maybe it would be a good idea to put a picture online that shows the fact that it does not have 4 sides?! Certainly my fault for misreading the title, otherwise, nothing on the description mentions that it has only 3 sides and a top, so it's not good for most roof top evap coolers.|Negative
Works great; price - not so much|Positive
tooo humid to test it|Positive
good product|Positive
Even on low, which is unexpectedly quiet, this unit manages to cool our entire patio area, appx 20'x30'. Solid, sturdy, we're thrilled with it.|Positive
So far the cooler works really well and is a good addition to our home cooling system. For the price it is better quality than other coolers I tried and returned because they did not work well. Thank You.|Positive
works great! wish it was in store item. Had to wait a couple of days, should be in store.|Positive
I do work in my garage which is apx 250 sq feet. It stays an average temp of around 77 to 78 degrees in there even when it is 100 outside. I have always used a fan bought from home depot for around 30$ which kept me quite comfy as long as i didnt open garage door. My sister decided to get one and I jumped on the bandwagon also - figured it was a good price and even if it dropped the temp to 75 that was ok. Got an outdoor/indoor thermometer to gauge the temperature as day progressed. Filled evaporator half full with water -(the night before - I filled 10 muffin pans with water and froze) - so I added a heck of a lot of ice - turned it on at 8 am and by 12:00 the temp in my garage was actually warmer than when I started. What the heck??? As I stated this is a glorified fan and it may work indoors but it is a joke in garage. Im gonna stick with my 30$ fan and perhaps invest in another pedestal type oscillating fan and chock this one up to trial and error:{|Negative
This evaporation cooler and fan has become a lifesaver for us! We purchased a 120+ year old home, and while it does have central AC, the upstairs of the home never gets cooled and is always much warmer than the rest of the home. This was the perfect solution for exactly what we needed! It cools up to over 600 sq. feet of space, our space is a little bit more than this and it cools all of it! The kids are happy, and our electric bill is going to be happy! You can use the evaporation cooling for dry days, and fan for more humid days. Here in Indiana, we have both! The quiet fan setting is great, it doesn't distract anyone. The removable water tank is easy enough for even the kids to use. It comes with a remote control and is lightweight (had no problem carrying up our stairs!). Compared to other similar products, this one is the most affordable with the best quality.|Positive
The new coolers are awesome. I had them installed in our church. They are so efficient that we have only had to run them on low and they keep the church very comfortable.|Positive
Once my contractor installed this motor into my new swamp cooler, it worked better than the one I had before!|Positive
DO NOT BUY THIS. THIS LEAKS WATER. I TOLD NEWAIR THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT THE LEAKS WATER IN THE SAME PLACE. I STUPIDLY RECOMMENDED THIS TO MY FRIEND. HIS LEAKS WATER TOO. NEWAIR PROMISED ME THEY'D MAKE IT RIGHT, HAVEN'T DONE SO, AND HAVE BLOCKED ME ON TWITTER. DO NOT BUY-THIS COMPANY MAKES SHODDY COOLERS.|Negative
total waste of money,avoid this model at all costs.My house wont even get below 80 degrees with this cooler on high setting.My old cooler got my house down to 65 degrees if i wanted it.Im so mad, now i have to buy another model and pay for installation all over again. CHAMPION 3000 dd is WORTHLESS|Negative
Enjoyed while humidity was down! Great for the money!|Positive
Excellent valueHillyH|Positive
I have finally set it up and so far it is working okay.But was not happy that I didn't seen anything about getting warranty at time of purchase. And when I went to pick it up, I asked about warranty and was told it was too late to get one.Performance is good so far.|Positive
ran it for 2 hours in a 8 by 12 room and had a thermometer. No difference in temperature. Took it back.|Negative
They work just fine|Positive
West Texas heat was no challenge for this unit. Now I’m working in comfort instead of extreme heat.|Positive
I have a window evap cooler and like to use this wrap over the cover as added protection. It is a nice long roll for a very cheap price. It is tough and durable. It is easier to apply with two people doing it together. It sticks to itself nice and snug and pulls tight. I don't know how it would work as the only cover on a cooler, but it helps the canvas cover I have stay put and adds a waterproof layer of protection against snow, rain and dirt. One roll is generous enough to wrap around the whole thing. And it costs next to nothing. Gave it four stars only because I believe it wouldn't really suffice as the only covering.|Positive
This is an awesome unit. I live in a 1000 sq.ft. rental home in which i am not allowed to make ANY permanent changes, so this unit works Faaaaaanntasic. Being from WA, the dry AZ makes my allergies go crazy, this thing puts just the right amount of moisture in the air to keep most my allergies suppressed (at least until i step outside) and I really don't want to pay $400+ a month cooling my home to 80 degrees either when its 110 outside and with the $200 decrease in our power bill, it pays the unit off in 3 months. I also put up a sunshade over the window this was installed in, just to help keep the direct sun from raising the water temp as it trickles down the media. I am using some small tubing to moving the water bleed off away from the house. So with it being 110 outside, the unit is blowing out 73 degrees, and it is 86 degrees at the far end of my home. Now that is awesome. This unit is blowing out air on average 30-40 degrees cooler than outside air temps. May vs June power usage is pretty drastic considering Junes average Temps are 25-35 degrees hotter than in May. In May we used A/C, set at 79 degrees, when it was reaching 80's-90's outside. And now in June we are using this unit when temps are reaching 110+ we are using slightly less power then when avg temps were 30 degrees cooler. I am very grateful for the help I received from Frank in Plumbing at Thunderbird store #468. He answered all my questions when other stores could not. I am still a Home Depot shopper because of him.|Positive
PRETTY GOOD DESIGN NOT TERRIBLY NOISY. KIND OF AN AWKWARD WAY/DESIGN OF FILLING IT I BELIEVE, AND THE DOOR IS A BIT CUMBERSOME...SOMETIMES THE ELEMENTS SMELL FUNNY, CAN'T QUITE FIGURE IT OUT. BLEACH PERHAPS , JUST A VERY SMALL AMOUNT, DROPS...IN THE WATER FROM TIME TO TIME??? THE WATER WHICH CIRCULATES FROM THE TOP IS PRETTY QUIET ALSO AND THE ABILITY TO PUT ICE IN THE TOP WITHOUT SPLASHING IS ALSO GOOD. JUST THINK THAT HONEYWELL HAS A BIT OF REFINEMENT TO GO THROUGH TO ENHANCE THIS PRODUCT TO MAKE IT A 5 STAR UNIT....MAYBE LARGER CASTER WHEELS ALSO A BIT TALLER ON THOSE AS WELL AS TO MOVE THE U IT SMOOTHLY AND MORE EASILY... I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE IS THE OFF SMELL FROM TIME TO TIME WHICH IS RATHER AWFUL.HOWEVER IT DOES COOL THE ROOM EVEN AWAY FROM THE WINDOW.|Negative
Way too loud. Throws out too much water. Made the house humid and sticky.|Negative
It was easy to install and it works well.|Positive
Great pads except for the smell when new. Goes away after a few days of use.|Positive
perfect fit am very happy with this product|Positive
I purchased this unit for our west-facing patio in Phoenix, AZ. The unit arrived in good shape; attaching the wheels was easy; the unit was ready to go in about 20 minutes. So far it is doing a respectable job cooling off part of the patio, in spite of the 105-115 degree weather we have been having. I appreciate the 3 fan speeds (only using the lower 2 speeds) and the water level indicator. So far, the only issue has been the fact that I occasionally need to wiggle the water input site (from the attached hose), because the leveler must occasionally get stuck and not allow additional water to flow in. Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase and it allows us to spend more time on the patio which would otherwise be intolerable. I think it would work even better in our garage, but haven't tried that yet.|Positive
The new motor helps keep things cooler.|Positive
works. would definitely recommend!|Positive
Easy to set up, just pull it out of the box, fill with water, plug it in and turn it on. Exactly what we needed!|Positive
Fit as described. Nice cover.|Positive
Well made, material is thick.|Positive
Ordered one..... DOA! Ordered a replacement....also DOA. The time and money wasted was probably worth more than both! Don't buy one of these!|Negative
Works well, and I like that it has the timer option to be able to have it run for awhile while I go to work. But it’s so loud (to be expected though)..|Positive
Very efficient does the job|Positive
This product performs as expected. When I ordered it, the first unit came to the store damaged. So the store staff worked very hard for me to get the next unit expedited to me and I had it a few days later.|Positive
Cooler is not a 4 speed as stated on your home depot site.it is a 3 speed.the cooler makes more noise than I hoped for.|Negative
Dropped the temperature significantly outside on my porches - dogs LOVE it - even on the recent very hot days in Tejas, works great. Great Price at Homer Depot|Positive
Went to clean the water tank and the hose inside has mold in it and no way to clean! And the fan motor has rust on it? I bought June 7 2018.|Negative
Came quickly with good instructions. Very easy to install.|Positive
The cover workstation. Reduced wind and dirt wonderfully as well keeping house warmer.|Positive
This thing freezes us out at speed setting 2. So most of the day it is at one. Easy to setup, fan moves the air throughout the house well when opening a window slightly in the back. The best part is Xcel here in Colorado cut a $200 rebate check within 3 weeks of the purchase. It would have still been a bargain at full price. Looks appealing and seems to be quieter that are small sized boxed cooler we had.|Positive
A great product that does what it is expected to do. I'd buy another one from Home Depot, they have fast delivery.|Positive
Media pad set was good, price was right, less than what I expected!|Positive
The cooler works fairly well. It does use the heck out of water. Filling the 4.5 gallon reservoir lasts about 3 to 4 hours. It also spits water out the directional fins. The Hessaire mc18m does cool well just needs some tweeking for safety.|Positive
Snaps right on and fits great. No more drafts!|Positive
installed easy, came with suport chain, chain could have been heavier with turn buckles to adjust level.|Positive
I read most of the reviews and understand that the cool air does not function well in humid conditions. I've had this unit three weeks and the fan works great, but for the life of me, I have not experienced cool air at all. I tried the ice block in the water tray, waited for low humidity and have a small space, but still no luck.|Negative
I work in a large building full of women (mostly) and they are always so cold. My office is up front and against window with sun shining in. This cooler does just what it says. I love walking into my office and most of all, staying in my office!|Positive
I purchased this product a week ago. I set it up last night. Very easy set up too. Today it was about 25 C outside so I opened the window that was closest to the air conditioner in my living room and turned it on. By the way the instructions say to put it in a room with a window open beside it. It took about 1h to cool down my living room and kitchen about 600sqf. The first thing I noticed is that the humidity in the room went up to about 80%. Also it had to be blowing on you to have the the best result. Again the instructions said that too. I would recommend this air cooler for a deck or patio and not for inside use. But if you are on a low income the energy savings would be awesome because it is the same as running a 150W light bulb.|Negative
Fit great helped drop the temputure a few more degrees Highly recommend|Positive
I would like to say that New Air handled my issue re my non-performing Luma Comfort EC 110S in a very professional and responsible manner. I had purchased it at the end of June and used it for only two months or so. I found it was not putting out cooling air much different from ambient room temperature. One of their tech support people suggested I clean cooling pad with a dilute solution of vinegar, which I did, and still no change. He said that if that doesn't work, the unit would have to be returned to the company for replacement. I was told there should be a bigger temperature differential between ambient room temp and what air the unit was blowing out in the humidifier mode. The arrangement for handling the return of the defective EC 110S was made in a very professional and customer service friendly manner, which I very much appreciated.|Positive
Seems to be working fine so far. Will see how long it lasts..|Positive
powerful fan and adjustable/sweep louvers move enough air too cool my 2 front rooms at once. easy to move to other rooms as needed. Fills easily and runs for 6 hours. Cools MUCH better than the refrigerated AC that I tried first.|Positive
This swamp cooler works good wish it blew a little harder|Positive
No it did not It quit working 2 weeks from time of purchase. I have replaced 3 so far since may. Everything is junk these days.|Negative
Wow does this thing move air. Very powerful. Using a 2 speed 1/2 horse motor and it really blows. Cooled of my extra large living room quickly. Have to slow down use now that the humidity is up in my area. Install is simple. Ducting for a side mount to a wall was a tedious job but I got it done.|Positive
I just bought this unit (7/8), and it arrived quickly (7/10). I noticed that it was delivered upside down. I dont know if this had an impact but...When I read all the instructions and followed them exactly, I filled the tank 1/2 full & turned the unit ON. It blew air, but NEVER GOT below 84 degrees even when ice was added to the tank. I noticed water under the unit & started to mop it up. It continued also to leak large amounts of water onto my carpet. I had to quickly turn off the unit, mop up all the water that had leaked onto the carpet. I moved the unit into a shower and drained the unit, then put it in the box to return to Home Depot in the morning. Horrible experience.|Negative
Great product and easy to understand instructions.|Positive
What I expected, just tie downs...|Positive
Easy to put together and operate. Cools very well and is quiet. Must be below 50% humidity.|Positive
Just installed one week ago - still running...|Negative
When you place an order and it is what you wanted, Can beat that|Positive
What can I say. They are cooler pads. They fit properly and cool well. Check your pan a couple of weeks after installing them. New pads seem to contribute to increased slime growth in the pan. Also try putting some evaporative cooler slimicide in the pan. This couldn't hurt anyway.|Positive
Pros: It works well. It cools really well. It's quiet, and it has fantastic air flow. The vent on the front does a very good job of directing the air flow (for a while - seem my con list below). Functionally, this cooler is great and it will easily cool my 2000 square foot house especially when the humidity is low. Cons: 1) This is my major grief: Like others, the controller did not last two years. Shortly after the warranty expired, the controller expired and energized both the high and low speed motor power at the same time. The motor hummed really loud and I was afraid it was going to burn my house down. The controllers cost about a hundred bucks to replace and burn out fast. For this reason alone I would recommend you not buy this unit. 2) The plastic vent on the front is not very durable - mine is already broken in more than one place. It still works but I can no longer position the vents to direct the air flow, as they now flop around in the breeze and won't stay where I set them. 3) The water pump it comes with won't last a year. You might as well save yourself some time and throw it out and buy a good quality pump while you are installing this. 4) It rusts and rusts bad. In all fairness, this is what evaporative coolers do. No one makes a truly rust proof cooler. You should expect rust and corrosion to be everywhere after just the first season. Overall I'm really disappointed with this unit. I can forgive the corrosion and the cheap water pump, but the bad controller and flimsy plastic front panel was just a bit too much. Don't buy this unit.|Negative
Easy to set up and use. I added a spider with 6 supply tubes for additional water to the pads and replaced the plastic float valve with a better quality one. We like the remote control, and the unit does the job in our 1900 sq. ft house...when the humidity is low. It has typically kept the house up to 30 degrees cooler than the outside ambient. That performance degrades as our monsoon season starts and outside humidity levels come up. It is useless right now (mid July) in 55% humidity. Cost to operate is significantly less than A/C.|Positive
When I finally got the evaporative cooler, I was quite pleased with the quality of the product. All of the surfaces that come in contact with the water are protected with a replaceable plastic product. The housing was sturdy and attractive. The cooling power of new Master Cool unit is considerably better than my old unit (Aero Cool). I waited for the evaporative cooler for a month in the middle of a hot summer trying to stay cool with an old cooler on its last legs. My order was cancelled and sent back without my knowledge. I had to order it a second time and drive two hours to Flagstaff to pick it up. When I ordered the cooler I asked the Home Depot employee that was helping me if the new unit was compatible with my 6-position mechanical switch set up. He assured me that the new unit would be. It was not. The new unit came with a very nice upgrade to Thermostat control system, but I had to find an electrician to install it.|Negative
"Well made and I like the idea of the felt pad on the top for even water flow thru the pads. It seems to work well The side pieces fit loosely. I just cut a narrow strip of a ""blue cooler"" pad to fill in the gap between the side and the front pads. In the corner. The new clips worked well. Very pleased . How low can the Delta T go ?. I'm hoping for 20+ degree F."|Positive
Great for cooling small rooms or bedrooms on hot days. Works best when you add ice to the water.|Positive
This is seriously the greatest product I have ever owned! I use it every night in my room and it immediately cools my room off without having to lower the air conditioning. This is perfect because it is on wheels and can be rolled to another room for use if desired. I will move it to the living room when people are over then back to my room to sleep! It has many settings that mimic nature settings or will run constantly if thats what you like. I also love that it comes with a remote so I never have to get up once in bed. There is also a silent mode that allows air to circulate without being too loud. My favorite feature is the evaportive cooling. You fill the base with water and when on it used the water to cool off your room and it really works well. I can definitely feel the difference when this feature is on. I would recommend this product to everyone and anyone looking for a great quality tower fan.|Positive
Cover fit great. Wish it had a little more of a way to attach it to the cooler, but used a tie-down and it holds fine.|Positive
Great product. Easy to install.|Positive
Easy to install. Runs smoothly & quietly.|Positive
The fan rubs on the grill so the ocillation mode does not work. It has to be adjusted just right for the fan not to rub. Other than that it works ok.|Negative
stops any debris from plugging pump and has kept its form so far|Positive
Easy to assemble, right size, very satisfied . Thank you|Positive
New belt works great and the swamp cooler is much quieter|Positive
Pads didn't fix right. Had to call you to get the clips that was not in the box .|Negative
Ever since my husband picked it up at HD we have been using it and think it was a great purchase!|Positive
Does not cool even the smallest of rooms but if you are standing directly in front of it will keep you cool. Basically a better than average fan.|Negative
Thanks|Positive
I ordered these evaporative cooler pads for two reasons. First, the size was what I needed, and second, the description said the pads were odorless. MINE WERE NOT! I never even realized that there could be a chance of an odor problem until I began reading comments for other pads.I had the urine smell through the house for three days. However, they did fit perfectly, and having the extra hard foam and smaller pads was great. And since it took so much time to find what I wanted, I just ordered another set to keep on hand. They have been installed in the cooler for almost 2 weeks.|Positive
easy to install, has been working perfectly for last month since install standard opening size on side draft for easy retrofit. Didn't need to make any adjustments and came with complete set of all required parts to complete the install. the 50 feet of supply line was simply to short for my project.|Positive
After two summers of it pumping the water okay it died on me. I would hope it would last longer than two summers|Negative
really works good, cools rooms well and timer is an advantage.|Positive
Just installed these pads in my 12 year old Bonaire. It came with 8 new retainer clips. My cooler uses 9 but I was able to us one of the old ones.|Positive
Very pleased great cooler highly recomended if you need a cooler this one works great|Positive
This is an expensive piece of junk. The auto fill fitting for filling with an outside hose does not work. The plastic off/on/cool switch broke off in my hand. So mine does not blow cool air. It's just a useless expensive fan. Very unhappy with Honeywell and Home Depot.|Negative
The drawstrings broke about 3 minutes after installation installation|Negative
Just the tool to get that pesky pulley off,save me so much time|Positive
Easy to put on fits good|Positive
I am already having to replace the motor after only a month of using it. It is only working on low instead of high; but the company is sending me another one to replace it.|Negative
Perfect for garage. We love it.|Positive
"Once I exchanged my cooler for a working one I must say this product does exactly what it says it should. I live in a very dry climate (Colorado Springs) and the added humidity this product add is great. Although there are pros and cons, I would recommend this product. Pros: Cools efficiently in a dry climate Light weight (when empty or low water) Easy to drain of water Easy to set up Easy to use Ice really does make the air cooler Little refilling of main water compartment Cons: Very noisy fan Water pump makes strange noises When fan is on ""swing"" position there is an occasional clicking noise Frequent refilling of ice compartment needed Very large"|Positive
Since it fits multiple applications I was a bit uncertain how it would fit our cooler. It works and fits perfect!|Positive
This item did not cool any better than a standard fan. The ice melted within 10 minutes of installation into the machine.|Negative
I live in Southern New Mexico and would definitely recommend this swamp cooler. It was very easy to set up. I have had no experience doing that kind of thing, but I was able to install it myself without any problems. The instructions were clear and easy to understand. It's working great and my 480 sq. ft. workshop is kept nice and cool. My only criticisms are that the motor is a little bit noisy and the pads look like they will be difficult to change, but I'm learning to tune out the noise and just enjoy the cheap, cool air. I'll deal with the pads next year!|Positive
I am pleased with the ease of installation and efficiency.|Positive
This cover fit perfectly and went on easily. We have strong winds through spring, so added the straps to help hold it. Cover seems very durable and tough.|Positive
Great portable units easy to maintain on the floor aim right where you need them|Positive
Don't bother, the fan is way to weak to cool any room. I bought it to cool my 8x10 screened in porch that is also wrapped with a 30ml clear tarp to keep out the rain and snow. As u can imagine it gets hot in the summer out there. I filled it with cold distilled water, and put in 1 of the included ice packs, the air was cold coming out of the fan, but it did nothing!! to cool the porch, the temp. just kept rising. So I tried it again on Saturday morning 07/14/2018 it was a cool 58 degrees (F) on my porch, figured I'd try it in the morning to keep it cool all day, but the temp kept rising and rising till it hit 100 degrees (F) after about 3 hours,I turned it off and put it back in the box, going back next week.. I also tried both ice packs but it did nothing to cool the porch, even added ice to the water and ice packs but again, nothing. The fan is just to weak, if u put your hands in front of the fan, u can feel the cool air but, pull them away just a little bit, and u feel nothing.. By something else, This is my experience, I hope it helps u make a better choice...|Negative
This unit cools my northern Colorado 2 story 1900 sq ft house from top to bottom. I installed it upstairs and open up the downstairs and the cool just flows down hill. Keeps the house at 70-72 when the outside is 95. On cooler days (85 or so) we run it on low and it does the job. I messed up the other night and left it running all night and when we woke up the house was down around 58! Solidly built and very effective! Made in USA. Wish I had gotten one long ago. The only warning I have is that it is a big unit (a 3 foot cube) and pretty heavy. It takes two to move it around.|Positive
Installed easily works great|Positive
"I really debated the purchase of this unit. My big fan worked fine, but tired of pushing hot air around, so needed an alternative. I needed to provide air movement and cooling for a 45' x 40' aircraft Hangar located in Northern Arizona (arid climate). We have used swamp coolers at our vacation place in Western Arizona for years, so know how effective evaporative cooling is in a DRY climate. I read every single review on Home Depot website before taking the plunge. Out of the box, the castors and hardware were located in the bottom panel, which is easily accessible and clearly marked from front of unit with a 2"" x 4"" label with large lettering. Installed castors in about 5 minutes, flipped it over, and filled it up via the fill door. I do not have water source, so I exclusively will fill with Homer buckets from spigot a couple hangars down. Turned on the pump and the filters completely soaked in 2-3 minutes. Fan is very strong in all 3 settings and provides a really nice, cool airflow from 30' away. The unit sits in front of Hangar with bi-fold vertical door open , so I don't use to cool entire area since too much untreated air enters Hangar to be effective. However...in the path of the airflow, the air is cool, moist, and has a powerful flow. I bought the unit for the 5,300 com rating, and am pleased with the sheer volume of air that flows from the unit. All others with this volume cost twice as much. The fan is extremely quiet, and the smell noted by others seemed in my case to be purely that of the cardboard-like filter media. The case is high impact plastic (which I was initially concerned with), but seems fairly sturdy if you don't bang it around too much. Not going to use hose fill, but the attach point is plastic and I would never use unless I adapted it to a quick disconnect and anchored attach point beforehand. It looks like a little jostling would crack it and make a mess on your floor. Unit uses 3-4 gallons of water every hour out here in the Southwest (probably lower in more humid environments),, but the straightforward gauge right on the front tells you when you are getting low. Swamp coolers work great if you are in a dry climate, but not worth a darn if you are in Florida or the Deep South, so keep that in mind or you will be disappointed. All in all...very pleased with unit. Cools a wide swath of our Hangar, and keeps me cool when working on or under aircraft or sitting at the table in the back (30' from unit) when it's over 100 Degrees outside. All our Hangar neighbors stopped by and we're very impressed. Home Depot is probably going to get a few orders from my envious Hangar neighbors. For $400 and change, can't do better."|Positive
I have used other coolers in the past. They have leaked, problems with filter, run out of water. I have used this now in my barn to keep my rabbits cool in the hot CA heat. It holds alittle more than 5 gallons of water. The output of cool air is amazing. My area is a 18 x 18 horse stall with tarps overhead to keep air inside. I have not lost a rabbit to heat stroke using this unit. The filter is so easy to clean out stable dust. If you are looking for a cooler for in house..this unit would be perfect.|Positive
Inexpensive and easy to install.|Positive
Hard to find cover available on line, ordered and picked up a few days later at my local Home Depot (free shipping). It doesn't get any easier than this.|Positive
It fit fine, but I wish it was silver to reflect the sun.|Positive
Replaced the same unit that lasted 20 years. Hope this one lasts as long.|Positive
I live in the Clearwater River valley in Northern Idaho. It's very hot and dry in the summer. Today it's 101° outside. The inside of my 865 sq ft shop was 98° when the Hessaire MC61M was delivered. It took about 10 mins to install the casters and load the 14 gallon tank with water. Once that was done I wheeled it to a spot in front of the door and fired it up. The pump quickly had the evaporative pads saturated with water and the fan delivered a powerful breeze throughout the shop. I went with this model, rated for 1600 sq ft, because the walls of my shop are 12' so I wanted to make sure the airflow was adequate for that space. It is. In 1 hour the inside temp had dropped 10 degrees, to a far more bearable 88°. Another nice feature is the powered, swinging louver that moves the air side to side and makes for a nice breeze anywhere in the shop. The fan is very efficient and it's powerful and it's not all that loud. Sounds like...a fan. It can be filled from a door in the front of the unit or attached to a hose for continuous fill. The controls are simple: Power On/Off, Pump On/Off, Swing (louvers) On/Off and three fan speeds (H/M/L). There is a water gauge on the front of the unit that clearly shows the water level. But, if it runs dry, no worries. It will not damage the pump according to the instructions. There is a handy tray on top of the unit that will hold tools or whatever if you happen to be working near the unit. So, I'm very pleased. Even though it's still warm in the shop I can always stop and take a break in front of the cooler and have a constant, powerful stream of cool, refreshing air blowing over me.|Positive
Excellent product, 100% recommended so glad to have it works really good five stars if quality|Positive
It Works and that is what counts. The perfect fit.|Positive
Good quality. Fix perfectly.|Positive
It fit well, seems made good.|Positive
Using it on a covered patio in Yuma Az. Open on 3 sides. Works good late afternoon at around 100 to 105 degrees.|Positive
We have several different brand evap coolers in our service shop. As one would wear out we would replace it with another brand in hopes of finding one that would not only give us longer service but do a better job in cooling. We purchased this Port-a-cool unit and it has out performed all the other brands by a long shot. The basically all plastic design has made this machine hold up much longer. All the others we tried had a lot of metal where water contacts and rusting parts were a constant issue. This is a very nice, dependable and efficient machine and we will purchase more of these as needed. Only complaint is that if you are not connected to a constant water source (water hose) the tank will run out of water quickly. It does have the ability to control the water flow but unless you have it full open it doesn't cool as well. I would recommend this cooler to anyone in need of one.|Positive
I have had three of the same model on a laundromat in Tracy California, I got only one season out of these, wraped them up for the winter and all of the bearings were rusted shut terrible so hard to deal with.|Negative
After many years of use the motor in our evaporative cooler became a problem with worn out bearings. We replaced the half horse motor with this three quarter horse. The installation was easy as it fit the original mountings, and wiring was compatible. With more power it seems to run cooler and now we enjoy the quiet operation. We are happy with the easy installation and improved cooler function. Would recommend this product.|Positive
I replaced a larger 4700 cfm unti with this Champion unit. The old unit was 20 years old and very rusty. This new unit fit perfectly, is a little shorter, has a nice finish and looks like it will last 20 years. Easy to install and fit in the old base and frame. Cools the house well (1165 sq ft) and looks nice on the roof vs the rusty old unit.|Positive
Better than the plastic. I bought a plastic one last year and it never completely shut off. So a couple of bucks more for this one, it was the middle priced choice, and it's working fine.|Positive
"This product barely blew any air at all, i was better off with a fan from the dollar store, literally. Even at it's highest speed, it did nothing on ""fan"" and ""cool."" Choosing ""cool"" was most likely the worst mistake. It made the whole entire room so humid it was unbearable to be in and even more hot than before. Do not waste waste your money on this product!"|Negative
Nice size for bedroom. Since we put it in our bedroom it has been cool at nights.|Positive
Great purchase!|Positive
The turbine vent was very easy to install. I take them down every spring through fall. Hint be sure and put your address on them. I had one blow off the turbine during a high wind storm.|Positive
loved it until it started leaking all the water out, i'm disabled and can't check where it is leaking from|Negative
I've purchased 2 or 3 of these coolers in the past few years for different applications. As long as you're not trying to cool a large house, they work great. We use it in Arizona in April through June, and again in September and October. Generally, July and August are too humid for effective use of an evaporative cooler. It adds very little to our electric bill each month...way cheaper than refrigeration. Swamp Cooler hints...keep a window open at the opposite end of the house of the cooler so the cool air will flow through the whole home. Rinse out the cooler once per week...drain the old water out. It tends to get concentrated with minerals that shorten pad life and cooling effectiveness. Keep the cooler on all night and you'll have a cold house in the morning. Turn off the cooler and close up the house and it should stay cool for many hours.|Positive
These work just as well as the other more expensive choice but save you a bundle of money!|Positive
not enough power to cool|Negative
"I'm giving it 5 stars because is freezes my house and my A/C has not kicked on since I installed it a week ago. I have run it on low for only a few hours a day in near 100 degree Phoenix heat and my house will sit at 72 very easily. I cannot run it over night as I am afraid it will freeze my family to death and kick my heater on. This thing is a beast and I can't believe builders don't install these anymore in the desert SW. I will say the wiring harness is woefully inadequate and as another reviewer noted, Mastercool could have giving another 12 inches of wiring at very little increased cost and made my life much easier. Highly suggest a water filter tube thing on the inbound water and the good old ""knob"" to run it is perfect since you have to wet the pads for 10 minutes before running. I made the error of buying the digital fancy controller but remember, you gotta wet the pads, then open some windows, and then turn the evaporative cooler on. No need for fancy automation. My Evap wills save me a ton and the ROI made this easy money to spend."|Positive
GREAT PRODUCT VERY GOOD QUALITY. SAD NEWS IS I BOUGHT THE WRONG SIZE. USING IT ANYWAY FIT IS TO TIGHT THOU. WILL BUY RIGHT SIZE NEXT YEAR. TO LATE THIS YEAR. THANKS,RICH|Positive
I live in Texas and bought this unit to cool the garage so that I could work there in the summer. And it does a fairly good job. I also use it on the patio during get-togethers with friends and neighbors. The Reason I gave it a four is because the feel gauge does not go above 2/3 full.|Positive
The fan is very good easy to assemble and use|Positive
This did what I wanted it to do. Good tool to have if you have an evap cooler|Positive
It covers our evap cooler and keeps the cold air from entering our attic - highly recommend it.|Positive
Fits nice and tight. Too bad it was last one or I would have bought two.|Positive
The product did blow very well, however after just a few minutes on the water started leaking from the bottom seam of the unit, so I returned it. Like they say first impression matter, will not attempt a repurchase.|Negative
No assembly it seems to work very nice fan and blows cool air they add a couple small water bottles to freeze and add in water tank to help cool water it helps to use colder water but it does blow cool with the cold tap water I don’t believe you should try to cool a room exclusively with this it will help aid other fans or a weak air conditioner|Negative
The pads are a resin material. They don't cool as well as the seltzer pads. I wouldn't buy again.|Negative
It works for a small area. Don't expect it to cool like a larger Cooler. If it is about 8 feet away, it really helps cool you off, but doesn't cool the whole room. It uses just 45 watts. I'm enjoying it!|Positive
I purchased the 350 first and it was terrible. Upgraded to this model for an upstairs bedroom in Lancaster, Ca. So far it works way better than the 350. The fan is much more powerful. It cools the room pretty good until the heat of the day sets in. Then I add ice up top and inside. I also add frozen water bottles (remove the plastic first). I will say I don't think it will last longer than a season. It doesn't seem that well made. For example, the little door that you add water and ice is already broke. And doesn't stay shut well. I've had it 3 days. Lol. Also I doubt it holds 4 gallons of water. Most ive added was about 3 and that seemed like I was pushing it. I do wish Home Depot would carry more of the Honeywell brand in store. I would've rather gotten one of those. Overall it's pretty good for the price tho.|Positive
Working great! Noticed more air flow through the vents which helps the house feel cooler.|Positive
Much larger then expected Came without a plug in the bottom when water was put in tank it leaked all over wooden floor and buckled area rug Returning to nearest Home Depot|Negative
It a lot bigger than it looks in the photo, but when it comes to coolers, bigger IS better. I used it today in my air plane hanger, Temp was 112F with 40% humidity, and I was able to work in relative comfort, with the fan blowing directly on me. This is as good as it gets, with out insulation, air conditioning, and a monster electric bill.|Positive
In addition to being very happy with its performance, we were particularly glad that it arrived sooner than anticipated. It is a little noisy, but that is to be expected given the volume of air it's handling.|Positive
It was to large a motor for my attic fan. I returned this electric motor.|Positive
"This is a horrible buy! It stinks its loud and it doesn't cool anything. They don't tell you about the smell until you open up the box and there it is: Product produces a odd smell 2-3 hours, yeah still can't get that smell out of my room. This product is LOUD! The water pump and the fan is just annoying and for the money you paid for this ""Cooler"" is just rediculous. I'm returning this thing tomorrow! Save yourself the trouble and stay away from this!"|Negative
I have not yet used them, but they are what I was looking for. They are sturdy nylon straps with a no-slip fastener that does not loosen when tension is applied.|Positive
Nice little screen to block out debris from Water pump.|Positive
My only complaint is there are no way to close the vent on the unit.|Positive
This motor is very noisy. I will be looking at replacing it in the spring. Other than that I have had no problems.|Negative
When this piece of junk breaks (and it will), the parts inside are not common. You'll have to order OEM parts from the manufacturer, and they're expensive. It's output it barely enough to cool a very small house. You're better off finding a swamp cooler with a higher cfm and common parts that you can buy at home depot or a parts warehouse. You'll spend way more in the long run otherwise.|Negative
I ordered a vertical swamp cooler cover, whereas I needed a horizontal cover. My error.|Negative
Have been using this almost a month. I live in AZ so its already warm here. So far it has helped keep the living room more comfortable while reducing the need to run the AirConditioner. Haven't seen a power bill yet to confirm the savings, but I'm sure they will exist as the air runs half as much during the daytime. There is some noise with the unit, but nothing that interrupts watching television or talking to people in the room. Only improvement i would suggest is they need water lines on the back of the tank (they only have them on the front) and you fill the tank from the back. This however is a VERY minor inconvenience. VERY HAPPY with this product|Positive
Our existing evaporative cooler grill was probably 25 years old and filthy as these things will get. Saw this item, purchased it, and when it came time for the remove & replace, found this new item was virtually identical to the old one. A perfect fit and installation was simple! Recommend highly!!|Positive
Simple, efficient design,easy to clean take the back off and parts are easy to get to.Works for me.|Positive
Better than the ones bought off the shelf and they fit perfectly|Positive
It is not working only used it for a week I am returning this item|Negative
This cooler works well to cool down small rooms if you use water and ice as directed and make sure to turn it on before the temperature of the room blows to above 90. It does not perform magic so don’t build up your expectation too high, but it does do a good job.|Positive
"5 Star Review -- Our old metal, window mounted swamp cooler died and I opted for this one that we can move as needed . I like the all plastic model so that rust and rot won't be an issue. If you plan to use it for any extended period, plan on hooking up a hose to it... it will ""blow through"" 10 gallons of water in about 4 hours time.. tried doing it without the hose for the first few days and had to refill during the night."|Positive
Great appearance and ease of use, for a cooler it has a big design flaw. There is a side vent which allows air to be sucked in bypassing the cooling pad and blow back out without cooling. The greatly reduces cooling performance of a cooler. This was only found after trying everything possible to get cooling performance to reach even half that of the home evaporative cooler under the same conditions including propping the unit up to put the intake right at the window. Unfortunately it all turns out unsuccessful as if the air doesn't go through the cooling pad, it doesn't cool no matter what is done.|Negative
I received my second cooler today 8-29-18 my first was received earlier this month,top left and bottom right damaged, the cooler I received today was opened by home depot employee, it was dented bad on top plus top tunnel in front where grill goes was dented, what's going on, H.D employees great|Negative
This cover has been installed for a very short time, but so far everything is great. It's hard to pull the drawstrings tight, as they must be worked through the canvas, but it was also very cold and misting, so I didn't want to be on the roof. The wind has blown pretty hard and it hasn't come off, so all is well. Overall, YES, I would recommend this cover.|Positive
Works Great|Positive
"I bought this kit to hook up my mastercool evaporative cooler window unit MCP44. The first kit I bought was missing a compression sleeve and 1/4"" adapter for put hose on silcock. It is easy to install and I put one of those in line scale filters in. The problem is that it leaks where it connects to the evap. cooler. It is a constant drip that tightening and trying another compression sleeve has not fixed. The solution, keep a bucket underneath that I dump everyday somewhere in the garden. I would spend the extra $10 or so for the metal hose kit."|Negative
We don't usually get really hot temps where we live. But occasionally we do, and it was one of those times. At first I was disappointed and about to bring it back. I know it's not a A.C unit but with ice water I thought at least it would be a little cooler. Not knowing really how it works I thought all was the way it should be. Here's what to look for, if the water is barely trickling into the trough on top when in the max position, the water supply line is pinched. I found this totally by accident, manually drop the pump for the water box, you should see two black lines, one is for a water level sensor, the other is the supply line. Looks like they tie wrap them together at the factory, and it pinches the supply line. Removed the tie wrap and we had a much cooler room in about 10 minutes. One trick to consider, the water box is divided into two sections. Fill the smaller one with blocked ice wedges the bigger side with a lot loose ice and some water.. For four hours plus, we had a very cool room, if not just a little cold. This works great|Positive
cooler seems good in theory, has good airflow, but is designed very poorly, I will be returning mine, when I took it out of the box the control panel was pushed thru its slot, I was able to fix that, after taking off the back the water tray was cracked, and good luck trying to put it back on, that takes quite a bit of effort to get everything lined up correctly. Also the way the grill box attaches to the mail unit is very flimsy, tiny screws held by just plastic will not last., For $500 i would expect more|Negative
It fit good so wind doesnt affect it. The material is treated making it moisture resistant. Light weight and easy to handle.|Positive
Everything was nice except it makes noise while fan is on.|Positive
not as powerful as I expected|Negative
I am working in a warehouse in Sacramento area. No a/c no swamp coolers. Temps outside 107. In front of this machine its 85. In the morning when its cool, I use it as a whole house fan. Good power. And not ugly either. I would highly recommend this. It does tend to spit some. Caused the oscillating motor to burn out after 3 weeks of continuous use. But warranty is covering it. I would put fixed fins on it to give wider coverage. Then you wouldn't have to worry about the oscillation.|Positive
Excellent delivery and a good product-only item to be mentioned is that the removable panel needs a hand hold to be able to remove it without taking the top off|Positive
Easy to use.|Positive
Working great! Installation was easy. Exceeded my expectations, wasn't sure what size I needed ended up going with a little bigger motor-very happy with it.|Positive
Nice and cool air.|Positive
The Evaporative Cooler needed no assembly. The direction for operation are clear and easy to follow. It has been wonderful in the Seattle super heat this summer. My large living room windows are on the west and when the sun is shining one can feel the heat coming off the glass. The cooler does a wonderful job of cooling my living room/kitchen combo. In fact my granddaughters think it gets too cold. The fan can be set to swing from right to left or blow in one direction. Using the fan only is adequate most nights. This was a great purchase.|Positive
The cover surpassed my expectations. It was much heavier than I anticipated. I would have preferred stronger straps to secure the cover so I purchased separate straps.|Positive
I received a NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are 100% my own. The NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler can cool up to 300 square feet. It works perfectly for cooling the living area in the evening when we are spending time as a family and helps keep our bedroom cool at night. The NewAir AF-1000R Portable Evaporative Cooler runs on electricity and water for cooling purposes, or just electricity for a fan option. It has wheels which makes it easily portable from room to room and is lightweight in my opinion. This is definitely something I could not and will not live in Arizona without ever again! It is definitely a must have - especially during a heat advisory where my air conditioning isn't keeping up with the work!|Positive
The part was exactly what I was expecting. Made of quality brass. Thanks|Positive
Its worked for three days now...no problems yet.|Positive
Great fit good value|Positive
So far so good.Hoping to make a difference when it’s hot so ac doesn’t run al the time .|Positive
It fit perfectly, drawstring was a little tricky but works if you play with it. I was hoping the fabric would have been little thicker but it worked.|Positive
It cools the 20' X 20' living room in no time. The right product that I'm looking for. The price is kinda high for me. Been using since I bought it last month and so far It work really good. The fan motor is absolutely safe from water mist due to the architectural design of the fun as well as the assembly itself. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO USE MINERAL WATER TO AVOID SEVERE CALCIUM DEPOSIT. It's 25 cents to 35 cents a gallon from the bending machine located around. The coldest water that you will put it in, the colder the air. It blows high volume of cold air. Take note; The fan is still rotating for a few minutes right after shutting down.|Positive
Because the thermostat control dial for our suite is actually in the suite next door, we're at their mercy. The office next door tries to be accomadating but they are not always there, so we have to suffer. This cooler has provided the much needed relief we need with minimum attention.|Positive
The value of the product was poorly made, plastic was bendy, so I am worried about breaking pieces of the unit itself. It's user friendly, didnt take much to figure it out but did I just pay $267 for a fan? Cause that is what it feels like. Tomorrow, I am going to see what the room temp is without the unit to see if I need to just buy a fan or maybe a less expensive unit at another store. But this one is more than likely, going back to the store.|Negative
Too Noisy ! Ran Hot !! I bought this motor for my new Swamp cooler and it immediately ran excessively HOT and was overly NOISY - you could hear the motor hum through the ducting in the house. Once I put in my OLD American Made Motor, the OLD motor ran cool and was COMPLETELY QUIET. I returned the motor.... My old American Made motor uses a phase shift capacitor, while the new Dial motors do NOT have this capacitor - a different design which alas seems to cause all sorts of problems. So try and find a good American made motor.... many Air-Con supply stores will have one for you.|Negative
Switch is good but not available in stores must order on line|Positive
This is the second time I have gone to your store only to have an imbecile give me the wrong size. I will never go to your store to buy that item again and will consider any other store before yours. My house was 1oo degrees and I needed a quick fix and ended up wasting my time and money and going somewhere else to get the right part.|Negative
We bought this for our bedroom at night which doesn’t have HVAC like the rest of our house and for all the loud noise it makes, it just doesn’t have the strength behind it to blow any air at all, even when pointed straight at us. The air felt nice enough, just in ultra-minimal amounts!|Negative
Nice quality product. Easy installation. Worked as advertised.|Positive
We bought this unit to cool the garage during the hot summer. It is doing a FABULOUS job!|Positive
works well.|Positive
My only concern is that the slats are rather fragile. Had to order this one as several of the connection slots broke. Am keeping the old slats to use as replacement if one breaks again. It does a very good job otherwise.|Positive
Worked very well. Service by department manager was excellent.|Positive
I have mainly used this evaporative cooler in my bedroom. I live in a 2 story townhouse and the central evaporator cooler does not cool the upstairs very well, and this portable cooler has been extremely helpful in cooling down my bedroom so I can sleep comfortably. It's not whisper quiet, but I'm a fan person so I like that it's not. A couple of times I had to bring it downstairs when the central cooler was on the fritz, and as a 63 year old woman it was easy to carry up and down the stairs. It didn't cool my large living room but I sat it close to me and I stayed cool while watching TV. Now, I live in El Paso, Texas and it was the middle of summer so I didn't hold it against the portable cooler that it couldn't cool the whole living room. All in all I'm happy with my purchase and may even purchase another one come next summer. Thank you Ashley S.|Positive
Just like the other one I had. Good quality.|Positive
This cover is nice and heavy. It sheds water and snow. Very nice product. I would highly recommend.|Positive
Slips right onto the grill and stops cold air from coming in. Be sure to use a weather proof cover on the outside to further stop cold air flow and protect the pads over winter. Drain the unit, first, then cover.|Positive
Well built cooler. Nice and quiet. Very happy|Positive
Works great. Does have wheels and is easy to move.|Positive
I only felt comfortable when I stood in front of cooler. Two weeks later it started leaking ALOT of water.|Negative
I really love this product I even bought 2 more.|Positive
Works great in my home office, a little noisy but not bad!|Positive
Its horrible and i would like to bring it back for another|Negative
Fit well seems to do the job|Positive
I was bought last month, it was run well, powerful, easy to used. But I had to return because it was higher than my bed, couldn't adjust the vent up or down. Sorry to let it go, after a few days use.|Positive
people very friendly|Positive
Product was as described. Nice finish; everything was there: tubing, mounting hooks and chains.|Positive
We live in the country and have this on our front porch so we can sit outside even during the hottest days of summer. It is nice to have a remote so we don't have to continually get up to change from high to low speed when we get a little chilly. I would definitely recommend it. I think that it would cool a home inside very nicely. I grew up with evaporative coolers so I know quite a bit about them in our New Mexico weather and heat.|Positive
Excellent tool for removing small pulleys easily.|Positive
It really worked well as far as cooling the room....but suddenly I was waking up every morning with insect bites.... couldn't figure where they were coming from....guess where?|Negative
The cooler works just fine. But I was shocked when it arrived, it's black not red. Much better color. We fill the tank with ice water and it keeps our downstairs comfortable. We have had it for a couple months and especially like that it oscilates to cover the area better. We recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep the heat down. Remember, it isn't an air conditioner.|Positive
Has kept the rain out.|Positive
Well made and fits perfect!|Positive
Fairly easy to setup and use. It helps some, but only cools off a few degrees.|Negative
Nothing else out there cools as large an area as this unit. Best evap cooler we could find and happy we purchased it.|Positive
Just what I needed|Positive
Good product for what it was designed to do. It is not an air conditioner but it will help cool a small room efficiently.|Positive
Parts broken|Negative
This item is a waste of money. Two weeks after purchase it started leaking onto the floor. The leak was massive and wet the floor to the point that some of the floor tiltiles had to be replaced.|Negative
It came in the box and it was good Just plug it in|Positive
Cooler works very well. It didn't seem to really cool at first, but it was installed in the hottest part of the day. After nightfall it really cooled down and maintained a livable coolness.|Positive
I have been through many evaporative coolers over the years. I believe this one is just right. It really sends out enough cool air. It is very well made. And unlike almost every other I've tried, it does not leak. Even when moving it. For every reason, I recommend this cooler.|Positive
Easy to use, works great! Oscillating feature moves air in entire room.|Positive
Of course, you purchase an item online with a generic description of the product. Read reviews and consumer reports, finalize your thoughts and make a decision. Only to get the product into your home and it does nothing it had promised. I will be taking this item back to the store. This issue is not with Home Depot. I am just very disappointed in the product.|Negative
they were exactly what I ordered|Positive
Fit like a dream. Easy to install.|Positive
"I installed this unit into a slider window which doesn't seem like most people do. I primed, painted and jammed a 3/4"" board on top of the unit into window frame to block gap above the unit. The air blowing out of MCP44 is consistently 70 degrees which is ok. It uses between 250 and 350 watts of 120 volt electric depending on fan speed with the pump on. The unit doesn't cool more than a room or two away regardless of where you have a window cracked to direct cool air flow. Be prepared to adjust / bend the float so it actually cuts water supply off once pan is full. I removed the pads prior to installation and placed sun shade material to act as a filter. If you want to try that make sure the material has a low rate of sun blockage to not choke the cooler of air. I would suggest adding the purge pump that cycles pan water every 8 hours. Also add a utility / leader hose to water drain to keep water away from house and foundation. I would also suggest going with the 1/4"" copper hose versus the polyurethane as it drips water consistently. At this point I would suggest trying another brand like the bonaire or a unit rated for more square feet and higher air output (CFM). If my opinion changes after the summer I will update this review."|Negative
Fit like a glove,made well.|Positive
We decided to do a permanent install through our washer utility room (see pics), glad we did though there were some difficulties. This unit has great flow and cooling capacity for its small size, a little noisy on the high setting but being in the utility room not a problem. During spring or fall days it will allow cold outside air in so we just close the utility door and no problem (would have been for a problem with window install). However the plastic frame is a bit flimsy and bowed and made installing the rear pad section extremely difficult. This does use real Mastercool pads which are very effective. One other complaint was if the pads are shifted it will drip water outside of the frame, a little reshifting seemed to help. If not for those two issues I would have given it a top rating. Also for the good everything is plastic, so no frame corrosion to ever worry about, no squirrel cage to rot out either. Overall a well designed unit, only was skimmed on the frame plastics. Uses a direct drive 3 speed fan using less power than the typical belt drive units.|Positive
Not sure if it will hold up to the weather or how long it will last. My canvas one lasted 5 years will be surprised if this one will|Positive
This Hessaire is amazing. Originally purchased for the garage, but i thought i would give it a try at the back door to my 1500 sq ft house. I got it all hooked up opened back windows and on a 100 degree day it kept the house at 79 degrees on the low setting after running it on high for 1.5 hours. Hopefully my $300 a month summer electric bill will be much much lower.|Positive
Better than I expected.|Positive
Easy to use|Positive
Works perfectly easy installation should work for years|Positive
It heats up the room in order to cool it off. That really seems counter intuitive, doesn't it?|Negative
Purchased it to cool a 10x10 office cubicle area - had a digital thermometer sitting on my desk to monitor it: it had no effect on the temperature, basically making it a 'fan', so I returned it. The Home Depot return process was smooth and painless.|Negative
I was skeptical the first night because it was cool but not that cool. Human error lol I didn't let the pump run long enough to wet the pad thing and didn't have it's back towards an open window. Now I have corrected and I'm cold lol.. I live in utah where the climate is extremely dry.. I had to turn off my swamp cooler because this little guy cools off 3 rooms.|Positive
The 40 in. x 40 in. x 31 in. evaporator covers works well. It is exactly what I have been looking for. The double netted vents are ideal for cross ventilation. The 2 draw strings are of larger nylon materials and help to secure the cover to my evaporator. The fabric is strong and is well sewn. The open corner worked well with the electric and condensate lines.|Positive
I was looking for a new unit to replace a 32 year old one that had finally started to rust away. This unit was an exact fit, so it was easy to install. I had it up and running in an afternoon.|Positive
Works great. Very happy!! Did order the next size bigger for square footage.|Positive
I bought this portable Tower Fan With Evaporative Cooling for my daughter's bedroom and it was the best! Very easy to use and clean woorks like and ac for me and I am paying less in electric bill :) so glad I purchased this if you put it in the silent mode you won't even notice it is on my little ones love this so much.|Positive
Attached to the vent (standard size roof vent) just fine. Looks to be keeping the garage about 10 degrees warmer this winter.|Positive
I was able to put in on with no problem and it has stopped leaking water inside my house during blizzard storms. Very happy with this product.|Positive
the plastic is definitely not as durable as something like a port a cool, but the 3 side panels blow away anything portacool has easily. After my first port a cool gave up the ghost, I saw these for less than half the price of their comparable model and said what the heck. Very happy with it, it runs 24/7 for my dogs and they love it as well. It's a real workhorse.|Positive
Met my expectations very well-it even made a very pleasent gift. Hey, thanks!|Positive
The motor Works great! Great delivery time. It was a great price and just what we needed to make our evaporative cooling unit work again.|Positive
I leave in Tucson and I don't think I would be able to use it during the hot summer day to cool the room. I think that more heat comes in the room rather than cools it. Might actually work if I manage my airflow in a right direction and right amount. At night when the air outside cools off I can get better cooling. That is my first Evaporative cooler, so I cannot rate it in comparison with other models.|Positive
Fit great and is all that it says in the description|Positive
Fit well and was a breeze to put on. Looks like it was made to last but only time will tell. So far looks and fits good.|Positive
Pretty easy to install and has made a huge difference in the house temperature.|Positive
What a great experience ! Thank you for providing me with the great service. I never thought I would find a new cooler cover. It is perfect and I wish I could put Home Depot on it!! Thanks Lovette Fox|Positive
The cooler had lots of dents in the side.|Negative
This product encapsulated my roof vent turbines perfectly. My turbines have a 14” throat on the vertical stack and are internally braced. One of three did blow off in a wind but after replacing it and tightening the drawstrings on all of them, they’re staying put. Good product at half the price.|Positive
"I have had this unit for about 2 months now, May and June in Southeast Texas. So far I use this in a 26'X16' building. I live in a high humidity area. When that is the case the fan is great. Moves a lot of air. When the humidity is low, using the pump, there is a 5 to 10 degree cooling effect. You do have to remember to have an air inlet and outlet so air circulates with fresh. The manual fill door should be of a tougher design. I have not used it with the hose connection yet. I like the ""Swing"" feature, moving the aire from side to side."|Positive
Works.|Positive
As a home owner, we have a single rigid media pad unit (AeroCool Pro) on our home. It is VASTLY better than a standard 3-sided evap cooler. It's lasted 15 yrs. now, with very minimal rust and corrosion evident. As a property owner, when it came time to replace a tenant's standard 3-sided evap. cooler (which hasn't lasted anywhere near as long and was completely rusted out), when I discovered a 3-sided unit and this one were only about $125 difference, I decided, if we COULD mount if to the side of the building, we WOULD install it. Needless to say, our tenants are completely happy. And, therefore, so are we. Please note, this unit is a standard residential unit and, thus, does not have a 2nd pump (purge) option, which our AeroCool Pro (The AeroCool Trophy series is the same as this unit) does. But this model does have a higher version, which is the same as our AeroCool Pro. If you can afford it, buy that one. The reason for less than 5 stars, is because there were some dings and paint damage to the unit upon delivery.|Positive
"I bought this product recently and I am so happy that i did. I was looking for an alternative to portable air conditioning. This thing is absolutely amazing. The fan has 4 speeds and the oscillating feature is great to spread air around the room. On high its still not too loud but loud enough for me to have that ""drone"" sound to sleep by. For the evaporative cooler part it has a very large water capacity 5 gallon tank, meaning you dont have to fill it so often. For my upstairs which is about 600 square feet total it did an amazing job of cooling down the rooms up there. It has water level indicator too so you know what the level is. Great remote control feature too so I do not have to get up and turn it down or off, I can do it from bed. I like that it has an air purifications system too and that it runs on a regular wall socket (120v/110 watts) so no electrical modifications to run it. I like that it has casters too so its easily moved around and it is all light enough to pick up and carry from room to room if you want to. Thanks also for including the remote battery! I love it! I used to have a New Air portable ac and I loved it so I am glad that I got this! Thanks so much for a quality product! I would highly recommend this to everyone who is looking for an evaporative cooler!"|Positive
I live in Phoenix, I bought this, on a day where humidity is only 16%, it only cooled air 12 degrees|Negative
Absolute garbage. One lasted 3 months until fall, then seized up. Replaced it this spring with another one, it lasted less than 10 days of 6hrs a day usage, then burned up. Smelled like it tried to catch fire. If you have to buy one, good luck. Keep the receipt so you can exchange it when it fails.|Negative
It met all of our expectations, we should have purchased one a long time ago.|Positive
This cooler, with a water connection does Great job lowering the temp in the Garage to make it a workable space and living space|Positive
After receiving the unit on time. Assemble was quick and clean, easy as that. For my application this unit produces more than enough air flow. I am happy with the unit so far.|Positive
It was easy to assemble just take it out the box and put the four wheels on it from bottom . Works great|Positive
The description of this swamp cooler states it will cool a room by 20-30 degrees. I was never able to get it to cool a 12 × 15 bedroom down by more than 5 degrees. Where I live the temperature usually stays in the low to mid 70s during the summer, but my kids' bedroom gets up to about 82 in the afternoon. I needed some thing to cool it off before nighttime. I tried different things with this swamp cooler but it just didn't work out. I figured I would just get a fan for $60 because I would get the same result for less money, and with a lot less noise.|Negative
The 2 units worked just fine and kept some upper floor bedrooms cooled down.|Positive
Me and my wife live in Wisconsin on a budget. We decided to buy this for our small bedroom in our apartment. With this on full blast full of frozen ice pack, extra ice and water we still need another fan to keep the room livable. Livable meaning we sweat through out the night and toss and turn.|Negative
It is running perfectly and I am very happy with this Honeywell product|Positive
average fan|Negative
This cooler is one of the best for its aplacation . Pricing is fear and when I ordered it it showed up before the arrival date. If give five stars. Note to anyone that buys one of this units is to take the time to coat the belly pan with under coat spray this will exstand the life of you're unit.|Positive
Love the size and red color. It works like a cool fan instead of A/C. I also found a leak due to the inside hose becoming mispositioned. Overall, it really helped during 3 digit temps. My Jack Russell Terrier, Moses really appreciated it too. Still worth the money.|Positive
The pulley was bent on arrival so now it causes everything to vibrate very disappointed with the quality|Negative
Works great to cool things down in the 100+ Texas heat|Positive
I'm very disappointed. I think I got a defective one. This motor would not last 5 seconds before overheating and turning off. I must return it.|Negative
Exact replacement should work great not installed yet!|Positive
This cooler is well made and works great!|Positive
I was VERY impressed with my purchase, the three speed fan was high powered and cooled very nicely but after only two weeks the water pump has gone out. It took three attempts to reach someone for warranty. They assure me they are sending a new pump out and say they are having issues with this models pump. Unfortunately I bought a second one before the first one broke, so fingers crossed it was just a one time thing and our second unit doesn't have any issues.|Negative
The evaporative cooler was dented on one side when we took it out of the box. It looked like freight damage through the box. The outside of the box did not indicate the dent in the unit. my son loaded it up and took it back to the store. The store had no other replacement coolers. This is the middle of some over 100 degree days here. The store clerk told my son he could keep the unit to stay cool and return it later when other coolers were back in stock for exchange. The damage to the evaporative cooler did not prevent it from working, so we have used it for now.|Negative
We could tell a difference as soon as we plugged it in. It cools a large room well. For your money this is a great buy. Likes: Water indicator (mine has not stuck, like a previous review has posted) the option to have it run as a fan or with the water as a cooler the oscillating effect, even though you can't see it oscillating the timer (since it is portable this and has a water tank, the time is great then you don't have to worry about it running out of water in the middle of the night) Dislike: doesn't roll on carpet too well and a little tricky to move, handles on the sides or some gripping point would be great|Positive
Did exactly what it says it will do.|Positive
Great product, works as expected.|Positive
"Loved the handle. Much easier to use than the standard round as my handle is at the bottom and doesn't make it difficult to get the ""torque"" to turn off and on. And yes, be wary of loose handles. Tried several for feel. Works great. No leaks. And yes, given my angle of faucet bib and configuration, I did need to use two washers to get it placed right for installation of my double garden hose attachment."|Positive
Found that the foam fillers strips were short for my aerocool unit, so I ended up using the old ones.|Positive
It's perfect for small areas, you can store it easily any where, doesn't take much space, you need to fill it up water every 8-9 hours|Positive
I bought the cooler 2 weeks ago after removing my old original cooler from 86. The duct work was torn off the pan and the old roof jack was rusted out. Finding a pan that converts a square opening to a round duct i had to purchase at a evap supply company for about 50 bucks. It was much nicer than making my own but way more expensive. I reattached the old flex duct to the new pan and screwed it into the frame with tar covering the screw holes and flanges. But the dial 18x18 roof jack from HD and thats where my fun began. I had people come by to mount this cooler and couldnt get it to connect properly to the roof jack. After reading a few reviews on here i should have bent the rear flange down 50 - 75%. After bending the tab i still didnt know if the flanges at the bottom of the cooler need to go on the outside or inside of the roof jack which still isnt explained in any of the insturctions. Finally mounted the cooler installed the old leg kit from my previous cooler and now i still have to mount the motor, water, etc. Overall the cooler is really well built however installing it wasnt as easy as some of the other reviews.|Positive
The cooler works well in small areas. So cold that you may need to leave the room to warm up a little. Keep the ice coming!!!!|Positive
Bought 2 other brands and took them back before getting this one. Bought it to cool down our garage to keeps our dogs cool in the sweltering Corona, Ca. heat. Works like a charm.|Positive
The cooler was better than expected. But Home Depot don't stock repair and service parts for this unit. ( pads and covers )|Positive
Unit arrived and after unpacking I pluged it in and added water and no cooling. I played with for sometime and even read the instructions. Still could not get it to start cooling. My wife said let's just return it. Then I decided to take it appart so I removed the back of the unit and after about 5 minuted I noticed the pump was not in the cavity where it would be at the lowest point in the bottom. I relocated the pump to where I thought it should be and wow it started working as adversized. So if in shipping the box is turned upside down the pump will move out of where it should be and your cooler will not work. Not sure if my units pump was not secured or if that's how the factory ships them. When working the cooler works very nice however it does use lots of water and I guess that's normal.|Positive
I used the cooler as a temporary solution to an air conditioning failure in the building where I work. It was easy to set up. Because it wasn’t a permanent solution, I didn’t connect the unit to a hose—which would have made it even easier to operate.|Positive
this is my second cooler of the same brand, the first one lasted 25 years. To replace the old cooler with the new cooler was a very easy one as there was very little modification to do. just moving the water supply from one side to the other. Just took a couple hours to switch out. This cooler cools just as fast as the old one usually about an hour to cool my 1600 square foot home. Plus its a lot cheaper than air conditioning. I use a two speed motor so that I have a high and low speed to cool the house. Also it puts humidity in the house and gets rid of static electricity in the carpet in this dry climate..|Positive
Did not meet our expectations|Negative
we bought this from the Air & water store and so far has been what we expected. it's a fan and it cools when we want and purifies the air when we select the ion button. our first night trying it is froze me out and i had to put on a sweatshirt and pants and it was some 75+ degrees outside. definatly keeps it cooler.. i also like the design of the unit. it's very modern and is not an eyesore. it also doesn't take up alot of space which is a total benefit. the only thing that is a draw back is the amount of space it cools and the radius it turns. would like to have it do more like 180degree radius but with the price this was a good investment. we will recommend it to our family and friends...|Positive
Great product and had to replace the old one with the same model after 10 years of use|Positive
Didn't work well at all, returned it! Too much trouble!|Negative
Great product cooled my home quickly. This replaced a 14,000BTU portable AC unit that couldn't even cool my living room. Just keep in mind that the 3 XeL50 panels will smell like wet cardboard till its fully broken in. This normally takes two day and your home will smell like a fish market, but once that done the unit has out performed any portable ac unit I have tried.|Positive
This was an excellent product and a direct replacement for the OEM pump. Installation was very easy and the product slipped right into place of the original.|Positive
This evap cooler works great. It's a window mount unit instead of a roof mount, which makes is much easier to install. The first part of the installation is pulling the fan box out and screwing it in. The plastic is a little cheap and the fit and finish are fair at best. The next step is to get the window ready for the installation. I have a crank out window, so I had to remove the window and frame, since the unit would not fit with the window frame in place. Once in, I built a small frame to raise the unit up a little (the unit would be nearly on the ground if I didn't). I had to run a water line to the unit (I used PVC pipe from a hose bib in the front of the house. I also made a drain system out of PVC pipe, to run the water away from the house and to the garden). Placing the unit in the window was pretty straight forward (recommend two people). We put a table under the unit to support it from below. We attached the water source and the drain line. Ran the electric line to the outlet in the house (just a regular 110v plug). We cut a piece of plexiglas to cover the space above the cooler, then caulked it in place. Finally, we put some foam on the sides of the unit to seal it in. The unit works great. Lots of air flow, the membrane does a great job soaking up the water and when the air is pulled through, it cools better than a regular evap cooler. I do question the longevity of the unit, the high cost of a replacement membrane and how expensive the cover is (we'll just remove it and store the unit in the winter). I hope the cheap feeling plastic lasts a while.|Positive
It gives us the e so the exact cooling we want and need. Is Compact, easy to operate, low noise level, maintenance free.|Positive
I have a Mastercool and could not find a cover for it anywhere except for this one. It fits perfectly, although I nearly had a heart attack when it came in the mail because the graphic on the packaging is wrong. We have strong winds here, so I'll see how long it lasts.|Positive
Grill crooked. Out of two screws holding power connection inside unit, only one was in right. The Four screws that hold the front panel on, one was stripped. The side panels are all hard to get in and out. Pump was in the way of the float.|Negative
nice motor work great and don't need to be oiled|Positive
It is a good product, nice and thick fabric. However, the mustard stain of the fabric comes off on your hands as you cover your turbine. What will happen when it rains? Will I have a yellow mustard stain on my roof?|Positive
Did not really work despot CO being a place where, reputedly, it should.|Negative
Our complaint is not about the performance of the cage itself but that the company, Champion, gave us no hint that they had reshaped the opening from the cage into the house compared to the Champion cage which we were replacing rather than coating its rusted floor. It took well over $400 to have the installer improvise the cage so that it would fit! We couldn't return the cage since we'd already removed it from its box and discarded the old cage before we realized the problem. Our guess is that he installer's improvisation was as good as could possibly have been done but is certainly not an ideal solution and given that the cage had the same measurements as our old cage should have had a notation that the opening into the house had altered! I can only hope that what has been done can stand the test of time. I am also not happy that, since Home Depot offers the product, H. D. would have had an installer available who knew and could accommodate the problem!!!!!|Negative
It was exactly what I needed. The neighbor who put it on for me commented on the quality and ease to install. Would highly recommend.|Positive
Does not really cover the square footage it claims to cover. The casters are cheap and not worth a darn. I like it because it is portable. Thank You.|Negative
We purchased this evap cooler to help provide some comfort to our upstairs bedroom during the hot Colorado summers. Our AC doesn't seem to cool the upstairs enough and this was a perfect supplement! It is able to cool our bedroom loft and is so easy to use. Fill up the reservoir with cold water and turn on the fan, instant comfort! We used it constantly from June through October. Unfortunately, the fan seemed to have stopped working on us from the constant use, I'm talking 24 hours a day, the fan was running (that's how hot is was in our house!). Luma Customer Service was fantastic in making the repairs to the fan and sending it back to us in a quick and timely manner! It was so easy and the representative was understanding. I would highly recommend this evap cooler as well as the customer service!|Positive
Great price and easier than I thought it would be to put in|Positive
The fit and ease of installation was excellent.|Positive
I purchased this portable cooler about five years ago. It works great in small spaces but I am having difficulty finding the honeycomb cooling media. I purchased this from Home Depot so they should carry the replacement parts. This would have received five stars if the stores would stock the filters.|Negative
The motor has been running day and night with no problems whatsoever. Very good motor.|Positive
Upon unpacking the unit, I found the right side (duct facing away) panel had been driven down into It's slot and had to pry it out to access the float/fill line connection.|Positive
Quality product. Easy to install.|Positive
This cooler is well built and works very well in my 10 x 24 foot workshop.|Positive
I have this thermostat installed in my shop and it works very well and is perfect for this time of year in Phoenix (before the humidity goes up). It's a simple T-stat, setting temperature could not be easier, arrow up or arrow down. Other settings are nearly as easy to set. You can't program in temperature rise and fall, so as soon as the room temperature rises above the pre-set, the cooler turns on and as soon as it reaches the pre-set temperature it shuts down. If you have the pad pre-wet setting to zero it will cycle on and off frequently when temperatures are hovering around your programmed pre-set such as in the mornings and at night. After playing with the settings I left the pre-wet time at 4 minutes. This gives more time between starts, similar too a programmed temperature rise. If I want the cooler to stay on full time I set the temp to an unobtainable low temp. This thermostat is great in its simplicity. It seems to be well built so I am not concerned about it's lifespan. I would buy it again.|Positive
I love that I could unpack it, fill it with water, plug it in and turn it on. When it’s over a 110 degrees it stil brings it down to mid 90’s. Our humidity is about 30% or so, with a couple of fans it’s been my main cooling for 500 sq. ft trailer. I move it from room to room. It’s great!|Positive
It has surpassed the expectations, for a hot summer day... I can say the cat likes it too, quiet enough to sleep when on, summer day sleeping has never been better|Positive
Worked in my kuulaire. I had to cut it down but works great. Order more|Positive
Perfectly fit in the evap cooler. Other years we have tried to cut down big ones to fit and it was a pain. This year I looked it up at Home Depot, since that is where we got the cooler, and found that you could order the correct size pads. Will order again when time to change them out.|Positive
I am extremely satisfied with the product. It is keeping my house approx. 15 to 17 degrees cooler inside than the outside temperature. It is quiet and was very easy to install. I would recommend this product to everyone, but I would say to purchase the bigger unit. This unit is rated for 800 SF.|Positive
Great fit. Heavy duty.|Positive
Quit pumping water after 1 day of use, would not recommend this pump at all.|Negative
Great air..|Positive
Does Not Benifit In Any Way. Try Not To Buy Warning|Negative
We live in a brick buliding that faces the sun. In the summer it get misrable hot. This little guy defiantly takes the edge off. Keeping windows open helps with flow. I haven't had to use our expensive-to-run air conditioning yet just this little cooler. It's not a/c but in dry climates it really helps.|Positive
Just place your pump in the basket and you are good to go. Like all pump baskets, if you live in a hard water area, it will eventually clog, but it prevents larger deposits entering the pump and destroying the impeller. A simple and quick install.|Positive
It is so easy to put in it only took me 5 min. to put on.|Positive
I had 2 of them ..It was a wasted of money i returned the item ..|Negative
Came quickly. What I was expecting. Easy enough to install.|Positive
Cooler arrived today 5 days after Home Depot promised when I ordered it. I'm in a very dry climate but as I'm sitting here hoping it might cool off 100 square feet, the temperature on the unit (with cold water out of the fridge) has gone up from 82 to 88 degrees while it's a decent 80 degrees outside (& yes, there's lots of ventilation) very less than impressed so far- likely just an expensive fan. Ugh! I hope the manufacturer reads these reviiews. And, not sure why but Home Depot won't let me not recommend this product - it's going back most likely|Negative
Water cooler worked for 1 day, next day water cooler stop working, tried to reset button nothing happened. I returned it back to Home Depot.|Negative
Don't buy , get 3 regular fans for this price . Just a high priced fan|Negative
Installed very easily, slightly overpriced but when you feel your ais conditioner is secure it's great!|Positive
For years I've been impressed with Mastercool and Mastercool parts. So I bought these pads at Home Depot with confidence for my 17 year old MC43 Mastercool. When I opened the box I was surprised to see instructions. The instructions explained that the pads may be too short for some coolers and there was styrofoam pieces included to boost the height. Well the styrofoam was not enough to secure the pad cover (water distribution) firmly on the pads, so water sprayed out the back side and was sucked in by the blower wheel. I found a thicker piece of styrofoam to do the job. When I replace these pads, I will remember this, Mastercool|Negative
float valve was just what I needed/ sales personal at store very helpful & kind. Thank You All !!!|Positive
I purchased this item for my teenager son who is always complaining that he is hot, he uses this item while he is playing his TV GAMES, he likes it and he tells me that the cold air last about 2 hours.|Positive
I live in Tucson, Arizona. It was 115 degrees outside yesterday and 95 in my 450sf garage where the cooler is. I'd say the power to lower the temperature by 20 degrees in an uninsulated room is pretty good. And back when our temperatures were really low (hadn't broke 100) the unit brought the temperature down to 77. I get tired of reading bad reviews from people who don't understand how an evaporative cooler works. If you take warm water and blow a fan across it you get warm air. If you want cold air you have to keep the water cold (as in, keep adding ice). This cooler has a good size opening to add bag ice but realistically it takes a lot of ice to keep the water cold. Otherwise if you want cold air, pay the money and buy an Air conditioner sized to actually fit the room. Evaporating water raises humidity. (Duh, that's why people in dry climates use humidifiers). If humidity is already an issue where you live you don't want an evaporative cooler. In Tucson humidity is only a problem during Monsoon season when the temperature is 115. Yes that means it's muggy in my garage right now but two weeks ago it was great. Truly portable air conditioners are expensive and rated poorly by folks who do that sort of thing for a living. And a window unit is a lot of work to install where there isn't a window. If you're looking to be really comfortable when it's really hot out no evaporative cooler is going to satisfy you. But if any evaporative cooler will do the job, this one will. For what I'm asking it to do it works really well and you can't beat the price. [Why the red one's cheaper than the black or white one I have no clue].|Positive
Poor quality and overpriced.|Negative
Bought it to help cool our garden center employees and customers. Real pleasant to have a cool breeze on those 90+ degree summer days. Does the job well. Considering buying a second one.|Positive
Not sure if I would recommend since I have had it less than a month and it is really only cooling my 600 square foot space about 3 degrees. I fill it with water and have a window/screen door open behind it and another one opened at the other side of the room, but it doesn't seem to help much. I will probably keep trying it for another few weeks and then may return it, as it really seems like an overpriced fan. AND, it is ugly in a room and huge.|Negative
Good product and fast shipping|Positive
Not as effective as I had hoped.|Negative
Nice and light, and blows cool enough for our guys in a large warehouse to keep from sweating down into their socks. (Of course they are in a space less than 2,000 sq. ft. in the 19,000 sq. ft. warehouse. I don't mean that it is keeping the entire warehouse cool.) The new unit fired right up with no problems. I see construction quality is much more durable than the typical old steel roof-top units. This will be a lot easier to keep clean too.|Positive
It works well for a dusty city like here in el paso tx, made in good plastic quality|Positive
I have had 2 Master Cool Evaporative coolers in two different homes and planning to purchase another for my new home. They are quiet, thank God they are quiet!! Sometimes got really chilly inside and needed to turn it down - that's a plus! easily maintained. You can use ceiling updrafts that pushes the air into your attic and also cools it down rather than open windows. If you have metal ducting throughout your home the Master Cool can be hooked up to the metal ducting and run through the house just like central air, coming out the open vents in your floors or walls in each room. Considering the price of a new central air and the cost of running one. The Master Cool is the better buy! Dropped my power bill to 1/3 of the cost it was! And they last! At the time, I was living in the high desert of So CA. Now in the High Desert of ID.|Positive
This cooler is awesome !! Uses the same media panels as the Porta Cool coolers, but one third the price! Puts out a lot of air. I have the smaller version of this cooler at home, and my dogs love it in the summer months ! Well worth the $$ ! Thank you !|Positive
Exact fit, seems to run quieter than the original motor|Positive
This cooler isn't enough for my 4800sf shop, unless you're standing in front of it. But I mainly bought it for my connected office and studio which is about 1200+sf. I really like the multi-speed fan and especially the available hose connection. It keeps the rooms 8°-20° cooler than the ambient temperature, depending on the humidity. I've had this unit for about a month and it works for me.|Positive
Good quality products|Positive
Fits perfect, good winter protection|Positive
it a cooler pad works ok|Positive
I was very skeptical of replacing my deteriorating unit with this unit. It was a hard decision to either replace or go with a central. Although the central is a better cooling system, the monthly bill is outrageous. With this unit, it cools my house enough (not as good a central) to be conformable.|Positive
One of the wheels don’t fit in the bottom of the swamp cooler, but I’m making it work since it is SO hot in SoCal. The cooler feels great. The door on the side (where you fill up water) is a little small I wish the company made it bigger. Other than that I don’t regret purchasing this|Positive
These pads work much better then the after market one's I purchased a few years ago. Very happy so far|Positive
The two large pieces of media included were adequate for my Mastercool II and seem to be good quality, but I won't test them until spring. The foam spacers, however were not adequate. My cooler requires a 3/4 inch foam spacer on each side. This kit had only one 3/4 inch of foam and two 1/2 inch pieces and actually the 3/4 inch piece was shy of 3/4 so I had to improvise to complete the installation.|Negative
The fan is powerful and the out-put air is cooler then room temperature. We were looking for a fan to use indoors and this fan was promoted as an indoor fan. However, we found that it put out too much water in the air for indoor use. It was easy to move around, until full of water.|Negative
Yes it did. It fits like a glove. I’m so happy it worked out.|Positive
I love this product very much . My summer is now complete, I can sleep through out the night, very quiet and it's just a great product all the way around . Thank you Be sAid and Home Depot.|Positive
Happy with its efficiency, and shape. It came with everything needed to include a pump, and float kit, just needing a motor and leg kit. I did have to find a roof jack that would fit it, but all in all a nice unit.|Positive
What a waste of money the thing leaks water all over the floor does not cool even a small room if you are looking for a portable cooler DO NOT BUY THIS ONE|Negative
It really didn’t cool the room much and I had a very small room, 10 x 10. Had to constantly put ice to feel any kind of coldness and the ice pack did they give you it’s not enough. It was returned.|Negative
Easy and quick powerful|Positive
very efficient cooler|Positive
I needed the cooler pads so my cooler will be ready to start in the Spring. The order went easy with delivery to the store. I have been using Aspen Snow Cool pads for years because they work the best.|Positive
This replaces my original Dial controller E12100A. It's located right underneath the air inlet to the house. The new controller acts much more like a thermostat, turning on and off, annoyingly so. It still cools, but when the temp hits the high limit, it clicks on, and may run 2-4 minutes then shuts off when its cool, repeat every 5 minutes. The cycle is much different than the old controller, so the cooler runs, shuts off, repeat every 5-10 minutes. You can crank the stat down to make it run constantly but this one acts finicky. We calibrated the temp twice, so it's accurate.|Negative
"Replaced an older Roof mounted Evaporative cooler with this one, due to age. This one is a bit larger and does an excellent job in keeping things cool in our large 4 level home. We also installed the same at our business location mounting it through the flat roof system, adding ducting to each of the rooms. Even at the shop location which has minimal attic insulation the cooler feeds all the areas very well. We also installed the digital controller at the business. The controller turns the cooler on or off based on temperature which is a great addition. Considering getting the controller for the home as well, but haven't decided where to install the controller as the current switch is in the hall under the air and don't want it to turn off prematurely. The one thing we were disappointed with was the availability of the parts needed to install it CORRECTLY. Unfortunately it was Memorial weekend when we tried to install it. Couldn't just buy the base and a small enough pipe flashing at the store. Option was for a whole kit for the base and only a 3"" or larger pipe flashing, so had to wait until our supplier opened to get the pipe flashing. Comfortable in both locations now."|Positive
I recently bought this for my 12X21 shop to cool down while welding and doing other jobs in there during the summer months and after about two weeks of use I can honestly say overall it works and does cool and move air but at a 600 dollar price tag.....I was expecting a little bit more. 1. my shop is approx. 250 square feet and this being rated for 500, I expected it to really do a great job but its a little less than amazing or great. Don't think I'm completely bashing this machine, feels great if you're standing right in from of it but if you aren't in the line of the vents its hardly noticeable. 2. I live in El Paso Texas where its typically very low humidity and pretty good for swamp coolers but after about two hours there is a very noticeable difference in humidity in the shop. I have an 4X6 window I crack open to relieve some of the humidity in there, and also have the roll up door open. I really don't have too much of a problem with it being humid but just know it does build up with it being run for an extended period. 3. Out of the box I filled it, plugged it in and automatically the left side of the cooler was leaking a good amount of water. I used the valve to adjust the water flow from the pump and it was still leaking even when it was almost completely shut off. I checked it out and was not able to figure out why it kept leaking. I adjusted the pads and with no prevail it kept leaking. Next best thing, I took a piece of tin and shaped a ledge to have the water run back into the reservoir pan instead of all over my shop floor. Like I said earlier...for 600 bucks I should not be having to modify the cooler out of the box. 4. It is a good size, not too big not too small just right, and the cord length at 104 is great if you need to move it around and the casters make it easy. 5. I was happy that this is still made here in the U.S. and especially in Texas. I have read other reviews and some people have had similar problems with them as I have and I have no problem spending a few extra green backs to support an American/Texas company but also as I stated earlier, for that 600 dollar price tag I was expecting a bit more, even if I am being slightly picky. Overall I'm happy enough with its cooling capabilities that I see no reason to return it as it does the job I need it to. But if any of these little things will trigger you to be completely unhappy with buying this then you should weigh the odds of these annoyances VS your needs. Hope this helped you out!|Negative
Worked great until the low speed start function died. Wont start after only 1 year, 10 months. The motor will run on low speed if I start it on high speed, then switch to low speed, and the squirrel cage turns very easily so I also know that the problem is in the motor. Only used 5 months per year on low speed only. These JUNK motors will cost more in the long run. Warranty is only 1 year. Pass on this one. PRO: Worked good til premature failure CON: Low quality, low durability|Negative
I have owned my home for over 20 years, and the previous evaporative coolers I have bought lasted me about 4-5 years. This is the first and last Brisa cooler I will buy. The cooler unit is only about 6 months old and the bearings already need replaced. Compared to other brands of units I have owned, this is by far the least reliable and most poorly designed.|Negative
This pump is highly reliable and quite. Routinely check the draw area for foreign objects, keep your water level high as not to allow the pump to run dry, and once the season is over pull pump from the water storage. With proper care, this pump can last at least 4 to 7 seasons.|Positive
it is great!!!! Thank you for having these on stock|Positive
I used this for regulating a siphon in a water bowl for deer. I got it about 2 weeks ago and it worked out great. Very well made and heavy duty. Here it is in action: https://youtu.be/p6_iaeYvYGA|Positive

Shipped quickly. ..very durable product...installation eazy....perfect fit...AAA+..Thank you|Positive
I have not gotten to use the product yet as its still cool out, but it seems well made.|Positive
Not only the product but the brand! Living in Colorado, the cooler works better than my previous stand alone AC. The cooler arrived with a broken barb connector fitting for the pump to hose. I called Hessaire located in AL after they were closed and left a brief voice mail. I received a return call the next morning from Hessaire, described the problem and they shipped a brand new pump to me which arrived 2 days later. Replacing the pump was very easy, and overall maintenance will be very simple. I will be looking for a larger home unit from Hessaire|Positive
Fantastic! Our home was a sauna, now it's like a cool basement, love it. Easily quickly and adequately cools 1200 square feet with no problem. Takes about 1/2 hour to come down 5-8 degrees and holds a good cool temp for hours after that. I can't believe we've lived without this for so long.|Positive
These are for the Hessaire cooler so they fit perfectly but I think they are also Way Too Expensive! (Not sure why) Especially, since they should be replaced every season but you do what you have to do to stay cool.|Negative
Very hard to put on cover. The canvas is sewn on all sides, so how are you suppose to put it on when the chains used to anchor the cooler are on the side. Had to buy snaps myself and remove the stiches to allow for chains. Very poor design.|Negative
Once you do your research to find the right size at an affordable price. You will find that this product is what you will come back to. I've heard that the only bad thing is the smell my be an issue for a couple of days. Since our Swamp cooler has a purge system, we didn't notice any smell. If there was, it wasn't worth spending another $50-$100 more for another brand. I did have to add a small filler to make it a tight fit, but they give you all the filler pieces. I still think the price for rigid media is too expensive to begin with, but after realizing the last one lasted 6-7 years, I can live with the cost. I give it a thumbs up! Quick delivery, easy to install, fits perfect and priced better than all the other companies out there.|Positive
I bought one of these for $235 I use it in my Class C RV it's Place between the driver and passenger seats and I use a plastic divider so air is sucked from the outside and forced through the RV outside temperature 103 degrees inside temperature 75 degrees I bought a few others from other companies this is truly the very best one I have a small 450 watt generator that will run it for 24 hours on one gallon of gas my roof mounted air conditioner is lucky to cool it to 80 degrees would like to point out that I am in it a very low humidity area I give this a five star|Positive
IT IS A EASY TO USE PRODUCT. IT HAS ONE PROBLEM. THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST 3 TO 4 STRAPS IN THE PACKAGE. 2 IS NOT ENOUGH.|Positive
install easy but only lasted 90 days. fan burned up and fried control panel. not worth the money.|Negative
Good product shipped to me quickly.|Positive
for the price I would go with a different cooler.|Negative
Really love the motor, very quiet and durable. The ONLY con (and loss of a star) is that it does not come with a power cord. Thankfully I had a spare and it wired up easily. Still, it would be nice if the fact was more clearly stated.|Positive
"These pads are fine. The side spacers are about 3/4"" too narrow to fill the extra space if you need to use the wide configuration. I cut the box into additional spacers and they worked fine"|Negative
The coolers came as expected, but when they arrived they were stacked on top of each other. Even though there were labels saying Do Not Stack. Plus the rear panel was caved in. Needed to install quickly, so we straighten the panel. Seems to be okay!|Negative
I have tried numerous roof vent covers and they all failed miserably, until this one, it fit perfect and it went on tight no looseness, could not rank it high enough, I bought 2 of them, love it|Positive
The drawstring was a bit awkward to use. Overall the cover is just what we wanted.|Positive
The cooler we purchased was lightweight and its neutral color is nice looking. My son installed it and it seemed to be installed easily.. I am iimpressed at how quetly it runs. My home seems to cool off more quickly than the last cooler I purchased. I don't need to leave it on as long as I did with my last cooler. Kudos to you.|Positive
Works well, but the instructions regarding wiring it were not up to the task. Had to get a buddy of mine who is an electrician to hook it up.|Positive
exactly what I needed heavy canvas material should last many many years|Positive
Really am enjoying it!|Positive
We bought this, installed it, and waited for our house to cool....after a day noticed it was basically just blowing air. We opened the back to take a look at it, and noticed the water pump was barely pumping water, and there was nothing to disperse water to the pads. We returned the unit. Found a HD associate who printed the papers from the company about the unit. We then noticed our unit was missing the water dispersing tray. Since this is a new item from this company and they need to improve the pump, we will not be going with a replacement of the same unit, but rather the other unit HD carries.|Negative
Leaking and not even 2 months old.going to return.|Negative
"I purchased this cover to protect my on ground Air Conditioner unit during the Winter months of inactivity. During each Winter, about 2-3"" of leaves, sticks, and twigs would fall into the fan area atop my unit forming a compact mulch at the bottom. The cover works perfect! Well constructed!"|Positive
Good quality belt. but the store does not keep the sizes in order to make it easy to buy.|Positive
Fit like a glove! Very sturdy construction with a convenient Velcro sealing flap to facilitate installation. Highly recommended.|Positive
We use these coolers for greenhouses. This is the first cooler that doesn't take up a football field of space. It is easy to install in spite of the instructions and performs better than the larger unit it replaced. I have two minor complaints. The pump fills with air when the unit is turned off and is prone to cavitation when it is started again - easily fixed, and the top of the cover is to tight making it nearly impossible to replace the cover without a ladder. Minor compared to how well the unit performs.|Positive
works great in the south! in Georgia, bought this for an office with no way to ventilate a regular ac unit, doesn't use a full tank of water in an 8 hour day, even in 90s temps outside with a huge 12x12 sky light in the office it keeps the temp in the mid 70s in this 2 level office space, nicknamed it R2D2, everyone loves it and raves about how much cooler it is in office. just fill it up in the morn and you are good to go for the day. great product!!! bought it a month ago, it has really impressed me with its performance, much more than I expected.|Positive
It cools one room in my mobile home. It is lots better then the last one I owned.|Positive
It works very well & is easy to move where needed.|Positive
This works very well in the dry heat and also great to use just as a fan when it's humid. Good value, not too loud and glad it oscillates. Very happy with this purchase!|Positive
Disappointed that the drain plug is rubber and just pulls out pushes in with no threads. It will probably leak after a few removals.|Positive
No the water pump didn't work or was not there and I couldn't reach their customer service by phone. The fan was great but no cooling without the water pump.|Negative
Purchased about a month ago. This morning, the fan will only operate on the low setting. The hose connection was useless, as water blows out of the front of the fan. Too much water pressure maybe for the cheap connectors (even on a trickle). That means it can't be left to run unattended for more than four hours. Nice, compact design, and nice idea. I like the moisture media. It's configured to hold more water than other brands, so it's compact and effective. The unit was working for my application. I just need to drop 10 degrees or so for a small greenhouse. It's just too flimsy. Shame. Maybe they'll send me a new cheap switch.|Negative
Cools area sufficiently. Blower is noisy. Instructions say to drain unit weekly. Is a pain to drain. Drain plug is in rear - no clearance to attach a hose, Do not drain indoors. I siphon as much water as possible out before I drain it. Take it outdoors to drain. Like I said: a bit of a hassle.|Negative
We live in Ripon, CA and are experiencing a heat wave, up to 109. This is our 4th evaporative cooler. This is BY FAR the best one we've owned! Not only can it handle the hottest days, it's INCREDIBLY well built! If the bearings freeze, (happens after a few years) these can be replaced! GREAT airflow and QUIETER than we expected! Remote is small and we're worried about losing it, but it is a huge plus. You can operate it manually, as well. That's something Home Depot could not confirm or deny when I called. So very pleased with this unit and consider it money well spent. Definitely will recover the money spent in savings from central A/C. We've run it for about a month, so far.|Positive
worked good for me|Positive
We will be returning. It is to large and bulky. Too loud in our workshop. Need something smaller. I’m sure it would be better for a workshop that is larger than ours.|Negative
I had purchased a cooler from Ace hardware a few years ago but was not happy with the price. However seeing that availability was very low during the summer heat wave it was the only offer in town at the time. My son steered me to this swamp cooler. I had misgivings because of all the plastic but decided to give it a chance. Glad I did, the amount of air it pushes out is fantastic and it definitely cools the air. I have not had a lot of swamp coolers but this one was a gem for us. Five Stars....|Positive
It will not cool. Looking into how to return it.|Negative
Cooler is superb. Love the fact that i can it in the living room and at night i take it to bedroom. It is too heavy, not too noise, the best part that it really cools the room at least 10 yo 15 degrees colder.|Positive
They had the wrong sizes in the bag. They are a lettle light for the price|Negative
I was pleased with the fast service of the product. The first one did not work the drain plug was missing, water went right thru to the floor there also what looked like a small hole in one of the tubes. Called the same day and told your salesman the problem, was so sorry about the problem and said we will ship you a new one today and e-mail me a return tag to ship it back. Got the new one the next day and it works great. Your customer service is outstanding and very rare. Have put your web page on my favorites for future buys and I pass the word to everyone I know. Thanks again for such GREAT SERVICE!|Positive
Bought this for a small office and it works great. Wish it were a little quieter on the high setting, but I can make calls on the low setting with no audio issues.|Positive
Well so far so good with this evap cooler. It is easier to move than the old metal one. The remote didn't work out of the box though. Mostly happy so far.|Positive
We installed this last summer and our electric bill went from over $300 a month to between $70 and $80 a month. The only thing I don't like is it gets stinky a couple of months into use and needs to be cleaned. It isn't easy to disassemble and clean, but the savings on our electric bill makes up for the inconvenience of cleaning every 2 months. For some reason the don't make covers for this model so we had to purchase a tarp and some bungee cords to prepare it for the winter. I would purchase this again without any hesitation.|Positive
This is the second time I've purchased this evaporative cooler cover. The first one lasted over 10 years in the Arizona sun and that was FULL-TIME use. I no longer use the evaporative cooler (I use central air instead) so the first cover was on the cooler 12 months a year.|Positive
The corner post fit perfectly. Unfortunately the 2 parts I ordered came in two shipments. That required me to purchase the the float at another hardware store. Now I’m sitting on an extra part ☹️|Positive
This is the best one I have installed,so far I've installed 3. Nice unit and just plugs in to an outlet|Positive
love this one because you can add ice to the water chamber|Positive
I have read mixed reviews on this cooler so far, but I think it is outstanding. I live in Northern New Mexico and it is very dry and we have had record high temperatures this season. It keeps my 2000 square foot house cool when set on high setting. We just crack a window in the back room and it works great. We tried a portable AC and it did not work at all, but this is a great buy considering it was $50 less than the portable AC we purchased. It seems to be very durable and was easy to install. It does take at least two people for install because the unit is fairly heavy. One downside is that it does not come with the vertical duct conversion kit, but it can be ordered free of charge from Champion. Also, you have to supplly your own water hook up kit. In 90 degree heat it is keeping my house a cool 68 degrees. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COOLER!!!! GREAT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!|Positive
I went with a larger model that what was recommended. My house is 1900 sq.ft. I got the 2400 sq.ft. My house has stayed at 73-78 degrees so far. I just got my electric bill and it went up $15.00. I can’t wait to see next month when my Solar is installed I sent in my rebate from Edison. They are giving up to $300.00 back.|Positive
I have a large evaporative cooler and the tie downs were a great length and worked well in securing my evaporative cooler cover. Since all the evaporative cooler covers I've seen are gold/tan in color it would have been nice to have the tie downs in the same color so as to blend with the evap cooler cover fabric. I think that would have made the overall appearance better.|Positive
Works great. Does use a lot of water but we rigged up a way to easily fill at kitchen sink. Might try a smaller one for the bedroom next. Keeps house 20 degrees lower than outside on hot dry days.|Positive
Recieved as expected very satisfied with my purchase.|Positive
Mainly at night in Bedroom,, with the Summer heat I also move it to different rooms. I also purchased one for my Daddy, he loves it!!!! We have used them this winter for the moisture,,like them better than a humidifier!! Great service !!!|Positive
The Master Cool saves me so much on electricity costs and so much more effective when the humidity starts to rise. Best decision ever made to have this installed. This is my 2nd unit as the previous one rotted out after 25 years of usage.|Positive
Good customer service product got before scheduling date dependable store|Positive
Replaced old swamp cooler with this model. Happy with it so far!|Positive
Very pleased with this unit. Have a 1500 sq ft mobile home, and can feel a drastic cooldown even in the farthest room. Would recommend that you also get the install kit (SKU 440353, and add a needle shutoff valve SKU 130826 if this is a first install). Unit is very quiet in operation. After seeing how well this unit performs my sister is also purchasing this unit for her home.|Positive
it was the right size and worked for out needs|Positive
I just finished installing one of these on my roof, just in time for the Tucson monsoons! The quality and engineering are very good. I think it's gonna be fine. BUT The media system they use smells like urine when you start it up. I've read that this eventually goes away, it's the glue they use to manufacture the media. And that you can speed the break in by 'conditioning' it with a process of running the pump, dumping the water, and adding a half cup or so of Downy fabric softener. Rinse and repeat, after about 10 cycles the Downy overpowers the stinky glue and it's okay. Wish the manufacturer or Home Depot would have said something about this. AND If I had it to do over, I'd have bought the larger Mastercool. The smaller does okay but doesn't get the house as cool as I'd like.|Positive
Overall a decent value for the money. The only complaint I have is that it does not have a protective cover for winter storage as many other evaporative coolers do.|Positive
This thing works like a champ. My negative would be that the fittings leak. We had to buy new ones to get them to stop leaking on floor. Our garage is about 20 degrees cooler with this thing going making it tolerable to work in when it is 118 outside. We also used it out on our patio when we had out of town guests not used to the heat and it really made the patio so much cooler. It is loud though, so it had to be pushed to end of patio so we could hear the other person talking.|Positive
Extremely easy set-up, great water level indicator, 3 speed is awesome, pads seem to be of good quality and directions were very basic and easy. So far, (about 3 weeks) cooler has worked very well on back patio of our Arizona home. Going to be using it in garage when we work there. If it does well outside, I'm hoping it will be great in garage. The only thing I would like to see is a hose adapter on both sides or front and back to make it easy to situate without hose intrusions or kinks.|Positive
PUMP QUIT AFTER 1 HOUR OF USE FULL OF WATER. WENT TO MANUFACTURES WEBSITE AND BIG AND BOLD PUMPS GO BAD BECAUSE OF RUNNING OUT OF WATER! SENT THEM A EMAIL AND THEY NEVER GOT BACK TO ME! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT|Negative
They are working great....my kids said they made quite a difference in keeping their rooms cooled and helping with the kitty cat fur in the air. One unit came with a bad remote control...I am waiting to hear about a replacement. Otherwise...great product and great value!!|Positive
It works only if the temperature stays below 100 not a good buy $300 to much for so little|Negative
Powerful. It works great!|Positive
Works pretty dang good. Even in the crazy AZ heat and monsoon.|Positive
After several hours of allowing it to run, the air was plenty wet making the rest of the house humid but it didn't cool the room much it at all. I rarely ask for a refund, but this product simply doesn't do what it advertises. I would not recommend purchasing this product.|Negative
Better than expected. High volume and cooling capacity. We are buying a second one for the other end of our factory.|Positive
I had a roof mount cooler before but this is much easier to service. Also nice to place in window & then remove for winter months. Grabs so much air is unbelievable when on high speed!! Pump went South around four years old but bought a landscape pump for a replacement & flowed more water & only a third of the price they ask for the OEM. Even at 100 degrees outside, will keep my home at 73 degrees or less, depending how soon you turn it on. Would gladly buy again!!|Positive
Great quality & easyTo install!|Positive
Took a bit to install. But it’s keeping our house cool on this 90 degree day. I wasn’t a fan of how much water was being pumped out so added a slower drip emitter to the tube going through the overflow pipe and it’s now perfect. A gallon an hour. Just enough to collect and use to water a few plants|Positive
Just bought one for our shop to keep it cooler. Works great!|Positive
It looks big and strong, yet very portable. Tried using it once outside in the summer (my house's in Arlington, TX) and it didn't cool very well (almost useless). I haven't tried using it inside the house yet.|Negative
This cooler has a good value for the money. The assembly instructions could be a little better. When I first took the unit out of the box, I thought the castors were missing because they were not in the box as expected. I took the rear panels off and rear filters out to see if the castors were inside the cooler, but they weren't. Instead, I found a bunch of packaging material and cardboard inside of it that could have gotten sucked through the pump and possibly damaged the pump but I was able to easily clean it out before using it. I then laid the cooler on its back to see if I could attach some other castors to it that I had laying around and found a hidden compartment on the bottom side of the cooler. Ta-da, the correct castors were inside that compartment. I have been using the cooler inside of 3000 sq-ft shop for about a month now and it works very well. I would recommend this product to anyone.|Positive
I HAVE ONLY HAD IS COOLER ABOUT 3 WEEKS. THE WATER PUMPS BEARINGS HAVE WENT OUT.ALSO THE FAN MOTER BROKE WITH IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS. I'M VERY UNHAPPY ...|Negative
this evaporative cooler has a smaller window inlet so it will fit nearly any opening...quiet on low fan and does a great job for our home.|Positive
Easy to install. Had more issues getting the water supply to stop dripping at the bib than installing cooler. Cooled house within 30 min. 88 degrees presently 14 percent humidity outside|Positive
This product continues to be of consistent quality and greatly improves the swamp coolers efficiency and life span!|Positive
Fits as described. You will get the yellow die on you if you touch the canvas while installing. The cinch cord isn't amazing. Recommend some straps as well.|Positive
Pumps work great, for about 2-3 months, then stops working.....|Negative
It's more expensive than the others but it still doesn't work. It's hard to adjust and still relies on that looped metal piece to attach the float arm to the valve which no matter how much you pay, always seems faulty since it's incapable of holding the arm on tight enough. It makes the other adjustable knob completely useless since it's all being held together by that stupid metal loop. It will either not float up enough, causing the valve to not shut completely & continual high pitched leak. This is the best you can do, it's either spraying water all over the place on the inside of your cooler or leaking over the top of the reservoir and over the sides- no matter how much you adjust it. I'm continually disappointed by each and every single float valve we have purchased & have yet to find one that doesn't make me very frustrated and angry!|Negative
Great performance. Lowered indoor temps anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees. I live in an area with low humidity so that helps. Fairly quiet, really like the oscillating feature and ability to set the timer during the night. Worked so well on my original purchase that I bought another one. Recommend high|Positive
Overall, it does what it's supposed to do. I would like the inside part of the value to have a set of flat or hex surface for a wrench to hold while installing, but that's the only negative.|Positive
It would be nice to have a lower speed setting. It does blow.|Positive
Pad was the right size, installation was simple. The Aspen pad works much better than the woven plastic pads of the same size.|Positive
This unit works great. Really like it this weekend when I was painting outside in really warm weather. Came in about every hour to cool off, and with water running, you would actually get goose bumps.|Positive
Very good|Positive
Easy to assemble. Works great!|Positive
Great quality and good fit. Easy to install.|Positive
the Master Cool has cooled our home much faster than our old swamp cooler. And, it came with a thermostat: added bonus!|Positive
Brought temp from 98 to 82 on my patio!|Positive
Very easy to put together just need a philliPh screw driver. Cools extremely well and is not noisey at all... Good product so far...|Positive
I have to buy them every year but they are supposed to last 4 years.|Negative
This unit uses very little energy. Completely portable and changes air temp at least 10 degrees. Casters make it extremely portable. I would recommend this unit to individuals with limited funds and/or space. This is definitely one of the nicer models and does what it is intended to do but please if you are not familiar with operation and think you are getting an air conditioner you are not.|Positive
I live in Fresno, CA. Where the temperature ranges from 90 to 105 degrees. I have the Honeywell swamp cooler on my back patio and it cools great. My two dogs and I sit outside and enjoy the hot part of the afternoon. The remote control makes it easy to use while sitting down. Fill with water to get a cool breeze put ice in the water to get a cooler breeze. Place ice in the ice compartment for an even cooler breeze. So far the cooler works great.|Positive
Very sturdy!|Positive
Works amazing. Quiet when running and cools the house upstairs and downstairs. Looks good on the outside of house, not big, bulky. The louvers make it easy to point the air where you want it or don't want it. Very happy we purchased this unit.|Positive
Kept the house very comfortable during the last heat wave.|Positive
Excellent rating. I have tried other replacements before when HD didn’t carry the Bonaire factory replacement pads. The ones i bought failed to perform in the way the cooler should work. With the originals factor pads the cooler cools much better then using after market pads. Pad install easy.|Positive
Unit assembly was 3 star. Two of the screws were laying withing the plastic shrink wrap, and a couple other screws weren't screwed in all the way. I dont know if Champion assembles or if homedepot does. Also, I dont know if shipping causes this to happen. Once I got unit ready and replaced the screws, unit works as it should. Would I purchase again, yes cause it does what it's supposed to. I just recommended anyone who buys one, inspect your hardware before u operate it for the first time|Negative
It came quick, it's nice,we enjoy it.Thanks|Positive
I replaced a previously used unit and it is exactly what I needed for the job.|Positive
Great product, design and cooling capability are exact what I needed. Very pleased with this purchase.|Positive
They worked well. The construction didn't seem quite as good as the originals, but pretty close. They do stink really bad at first. I even put them outside and soaked them in water for a week before installing them. They still had a horrible odor the couple of days.|Positive
Easy set up & works great! Store pick up was excellent & staff/manager was first class service.|Positive
good air source but the evaporator pads dry up and do not get wet evenly so it just blows hot air unless you wet it constantly with a water hose or water container|Negative
Hasn't been installed long enough to really know|Positive
Relatively light and not too hard to install. Cools off house very well.|Positive
work better than expected!!!|Positive
"Bought this cooler to replace a BonAir cooler who's pump motor was dying and too loud. Had intended to buy the 700CFM model, but they were all out and there was only ONE 500CFM unit left, so I grabbed it. MUCH sturdier unit compared to the BonAir. And a little more compact, despite it's dimensions. This unit has a much better air flow throughput than the one it's replacing. It puts out more air on LOW than the old unit did on HI. And I like the oscillating louvers that you can let sweep the room, or stop it with the remote control when it's pointed right at you for that ""Ahhhhhhh......"" moment. It holds five gallons of water, which lasts quite a while apparently. If it does run out of water and you're not there, it sounds a brief alarm and turns off the water pump leaving the fan running. As I said, it moves a good deal of air, even on LOW. And the sound level isn't too bad. You can easily listen to TV with it sitting next to you. Turning up the fan speed increases the sound level, but it doesn't seem to increase the amount of air flow as much as the sound would indicate. Low speed works in our room. The fan is an efficient ""squirrel cage"" design so it's fairly quiet. Rolls easily even with water in it. And it has an unusual feature: An Ice Chamber. On top of the unit is a plastic lid/door where you find the Water Control knob. (You want it FULL ON anyway) The water from the pump flows through this area so as to distribute the water to flow down over the cooling pad/filter. You can dump ice cubes into this area to cool the water before it goes to the cooling pad for greater cooling effect. Does seem to work, but the ice melts fast. You'll need a lot of ice on hand if you want to keep it full. But the normal cooling operation seems to work fine by itself. Definitely cools our little room. The ONLY thing I can gripe about is the fact that there is NO external indicator of any kind that tells you what the water level is. I found that odd. Still, I'd recommend this unit if you're looking to cool a small to medium size room. Will it cool as well as A/C? No. But then, no Evap Cooler can. This does what it does well."|Positive
Didn’t cool as expected.|Negative
Does a great job cooling down my patio.|Positive
"After years of service my old Champion Aspen Media Cooler finally gave up the ghost suddenly. We had decided long ago this would be the replacement. It was an excellent choice! 89° out side today and it was 62° inside. We are in the high desert where the humidity stays near 10% most of the time. This cooler efficiently cools a 1782 Sq Ft home with ease. I installed a 3/4 HP motor with a 4""x 1/2"" bore Shieve. I adjusted it to the amp rating of the motor and so far 3 days later the volume of air is obvious! It continues to blow out sand and grit out of the ducts. I guess you can call that a bad thing if you didn't know what was happening. That debris has always been in the vents. The old cooler did not have enough volume of air to move it. Now this cooler continues to blow out debris. It will eventually stop. That is the only draw back. The cooler was installed with a champion leg kit. it was a simple to install if your mechanically adept."|Positive
Great buy! Would highly recommend.|Positive
assembly fine.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................|Negative
Cooler looks good and works great. Have been using evap coolers for over 50 years. Changed out the aspen pads as aspen pads fall apart and leave tons of aspen junk in the water clogging the water pump and screens and are terrible to remove and replace each season. Blue-cool pads are much less maintenance and easy to install and a whole lot cleaner and filter the outside air as it passes thru.|Positive
The first unit had a bad fan. They exchanged it right away and new one works great. So nice have not been forced to go over level low.|Positive
He seems to like it. He lives in a mobile home and it gets pretty hot and it seems to work well. Home Depot delivered it very fast.|Positive
Cooler works great, but factory quality control is lousy. Front bezel (part where the air is directionally controlled) is held on with 4 screws. Came loose during installation because only 1 screw actually went through a hole in the main section. Other 3 screws just caught the edge of the sheet metal. After I drilled 3 holes for the other screws and properly attached the bezel, the cooler worked fine.|Negative
This did not work very good!|Negative
900 sq ft garage in Arizona. Did not cool it, but the air was cool when it blew past you. Also, it works against the a/c unit because there is a air handler in the garage and it puts too much moisture in the air. Probably wouldn't buy again.|Negative
it did what i bought it for cool my garage as it really gets hot here in Mohave Valley,AZ|Positive
The float arm is long enough to insure positive closure even at higher water pressures. Easily adjustable and quick installation.|Positive
Very happy with this unit. Easy installation and cools quitely.|Positive
This cover is more durable than my old one and easier to cover cooler. It is better than expected. I expect it to last longer than the last one also. Thanks|Positive
"Should have replaced my old pads years ago. I have very hard water and calcium deposits had severely restricted airflow. These pads took a little patience to install because of the balancing act keeping the separate CELdek pieces in place along with Styrofoam filler pieces around the bottom and sides. After a few days of ""new pad smell"", everything is running like new. Was impressed with fast delivery time and free shipping."|Positive
My experience ordering online and dealing with staff was good. However, the cooler was damaged and very poorly built. I was truly surprised that they would have even considered boxing the cooler up when it was not even riveted straight. It took a lot of work to straighten it out and make it square the way it was intended to have been...... Never again! That is the problem with ordering online....you cannot view the product before purchasing.|Negative
We live in a motor home park and the elect is kind of pricey. This cooler has cut our elect bill way down and it does keep us kool. I found when it arrived the hose was bent and would not run water. Very easy to correct. Joe B|Positive
Works great! Nice and quiet! Like it better if it had a constant water feed so there were no water refill interruptions. Recommend to all who need an affordable evaporative cooler for small to medium size room area|Positive
I just bought it today. It does blow cooler air as advertised ut the fan is not meeting my expectations. I put ice water in it but air flow is weak. Don't bother getting this product.|Negative
After years of using the old style cooler we decided to try something new. This cooler is great. We live in the Central Valley of California where it is hot all summer and this thing has kept the house at a nice temperature. It was a little bent up when I unpacked it, but nothing that couldn't be easily straightened out. Glad we made the switch.|Positive
I HAVE IT IN MY BEDROOM AND JUST BEING ON THE FAN SETTING IT COOLS OFF MY ROOM GREAT. I CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT WILL DO WHEN I USE THE COOLING FEATURE.|Positive
This portable ac really blows, its quiet and effective where most evaporated coolers do not work in New Mexico.|Positive
Very please with quality and ease of installment. Am hoping it holds up well over the winter season|Positive
The unit works well. I have a room that tends to get heat in the afternoons, the unit did a great job of cooling the room off.|Positive
Not very powerful. But it did cool my small bedroom somewhat better than an ordinary fan. Instructions were laughably poor, but the manufacturer does have a help line.|Negative
Keeps my swamp cooler blowing cold breezy air|Positive
Really good beyond my expectations I recommended to every one|Positive
This item is not worth buying - I rent a large room and it didn’t make a dent as far as cooling - I’m so sorry I purchased it.|Negative
The only thing that works great it the fan it blows hard. It does not cool anything! Don't waste ur money|Negative
Great fitment in our UltraCool (Champion) AUA70 cooler, with seemingly less startup odor than another brand. Two of the included thin pieces of media fit up into the water distribution manifold to prevent water from spraying out of the cooler grating and onto the concrete. Will definitely buy again|Positive
We use it in our garage. Does a good job even with the garage door open; in the hot Texas summers even with high humidity it helps keep you a little bit more comfortable.|Positive
the rollers are inside the unit which requires you to take a side panel off to get to them is all the assembly you have to do when it arrives but there were no instructions to this....works great|Positive
Greatly pleased with the evap cooler! Works ever so much better than the other one we had! Truly exceeds my expectations. The cooled air reaches all rooms in our home.|Positive
It fit really nice and it looks very heavy duty cover|Positive
Enjoying the portable Evap Cooler|Positive
While I like the unit’s outside design and appearance over the old style box units, it definitely needed some attention to get it working properly. First the pump wasn’t working. Upon inspection I found the small fan on the top of the pump was not seated in the right position and it was jammed against the pump lid that wouldn’t close because of it. Then the float valve needed major adjustment and was loosely attached. The 6 inch drain tube was something that I wasn’t expecting. I had to buy a 6 foot piece of tubing and attach it to the drain tube that would reach the ground so it wouldn’t splash or spray against the house. There is four screws that hold the filter cover on the unit are simple to remove but I wouldn’t expect them to last very long in the plastic. I would like to see a longer lasting alternative that you can remove quickly. Once everything was up and running it was very quiet and worked as efficiently as our old bulky box unit. The power company rebate didn’t hurt either.|Positive
This cover was easy to put onto the cooler, but is a bit too large. I would prefer it to fit more snugly like my old cover, so the wind will not get underneath it. The drawstring is very small. I hope it will be strong enough to last many years. The canvas seems very durable.|Positive
It worked fine as a fan but did not cool the room at all...|Negative
I ordered and received the pads for my swamp cooler in a very timely manner and they fit perfectly! Very easy to install.|Positive
Although it hasn't gone through its first season, so far it is exactly what I wanted.|Positive
Good investment to my house|Positive
Easy to install, decently priced and runs great. Life saver in the summer heat|Positive
Hardly put out any cool air. It used too much water and the water gauge was not showing accurate amounts of water in the fill container.Awkward unit|Negative
Works great in a large automotive shop. The tech next to me ran out and bought on as well. I also have a smaller cyclone 120 at home for my garage and a small shop. I’m not sure why it gets such poor reviews. Sure it’s a little pricy but you get what you pay for. Super low maintenance, durable.|Positive
I purchased this cooler for use on my back patio during the hot Arizona summers. I chose this make and model because the air volume (5300 CFM) was twice the competitors at half the price. I read all of the reviews, both pro and cons and took the risk. The cooler is formed plastic, not the heavy fiber and polymers used by the name brand units. The fan mountings and pump are secure. The review I read of this model states that it does not have a hose hookup. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it does have one and a float valve. I get about 2.5 hours out of a tank of water, without the hose connection. The wheels were heavier duty than I expected. The air volume produced is exceptional. My patio is 16x13 and walled on three sides. The first time I used it some of my guests put on sweaters and or walked into the yard to warm up. I can set it at my rear glass door and it will cool my whole house. This is not a cooler you would want on rough terrain or doing a lot of moving around. On a flat relatively level surface with minimal moving around, it works as good if not better than advertised and should last. I have already recommended this unit to all of my friends.|Positive
Price for the product. Poorly quality control when manufactured, the down-drift hood to the vent was bend and additional screw was added to hold it in place. Since there is not a major defect, I still install it to my roof.|Negative
Great and easy replacement!|Positive
The pads are excellent|Positive
"This product was very easy to install. It is simply a chemically treated bag with a draw string on it. I think it looks a lot better than the garbage bag/duct tape combo that some of my neighbors have. It is a pretty bright yellow/gold, but that doesn't bother me. The only ""bad"" that I could say is that the bag isn't super tight fitting. The drawstring does hold it on though, so I'm not worried about it blowing away. I'm hoping that the small $10 investment will be a product that lasts for many seasons."|Positive
great Window Evaporative Cooler ,,, easy install ,,,|Positive
Wonderful. Working great...really kicks out the cool air.|Positive
Very easy to install, and sturdy. Wish it came with a few more screws|Positive
Love my new cooler work outside in phx it’s great gonna get the bigger one as well for next summer|Positive
The build quality is great, I got over 5 years with the last ones. Cleaning can be difficult. There is a very noticeable difference in my unheated attic with these covers. Even at near to below zero temperatures, it's still warm, about 55F, and its made in Utah.|Positive
It's a very nice design but rather on the large size.|Positive
The only reason I rated this product a 4 is that the documentation and installation instructions are a little sparse. It would have only taken a hour to fill in gaps. I emailed the company for more information, but they didn't respond. However, the product works great! It hasn't been as hot since I bought it, but it is supposed to climb back up next weekend. That will be the true test. Have this in a 1000 sq ft metal building that I use as a woodworking shop. I live in Southern California, and the roof temp reaches 140 deg in the summer. The cooler has kept the shop cool enough to work in when on medium setting. It is also relatively quiet, I have a 2600 CFM exhaust fan for the building, and it makes much more noise.|Positive
Make sure you remove the plastic and cardboard before you leave the store to inspect the cooler for dents. I have bought two and made the mistake of lifting them on the roof with the rap only to find them beat up with dents. To hard to return at that point. Inspect the cooler!|Negative
ABSOLUTELY PERFECTO!!!! HARD TO FIND TOO THANKS,HD|Positive
Awesome product, I live in the desert and this cooler brings down the temp up to 20 degrees , now I can be in the garage Now I can change oil outside the garage without covering while it’s 115. Too bad I didn’t get this sooner.|Positive
This product is a Master Cool replacement filter for multiple models of Master Cool Coolers. Followed the instructions to assemble the multiple pieces and it worked perfectly.|Positive
make sure you totally unwrap this unit before paying for it! They drop these often apparently and sell the damaged unit anyway. I bought one and when I got it to my truck I opened the plastic to find the grille was destroyed and the metal was badly damaged. I went back for another to find they were almost ALL DAMAGED!|Negative
Really loud, creates a lot of humidity and condensation while in use. This purchase is a disappointment. We have had this just a couple weeks. We had it in a room with a number of bookshelves and all the pages of the books are warped.|Negative
Great for cooling down 1000 square ft. Easy to install into window, and easy hook up. The best part it came with motor.|Positive
"Not expected cooling efficiency. I figure it cooled to only about 74F, when it finally kicked in. Bought in July 2016. Now, the machine is leaking water from somewhere and has damaged the floor tiles. The cooling efficiency has picked up some, but not enough quality to say ""hey, this is what you need"" especially now that it leaks."|Negative
Exceeded expectations|Positive
Very easy to install and they worked miracles on my high temperature house. The temperature in the front of my house was 96°-100° during the day with the old pads. After I installed the new pads the temperature is down to 80° during the day and 74° at night. What a difference new pads made. The old ones were filled with calcium and lime deposits from our hard water. It is definitely worth the money and time to change them when they get old. :)|Positive
Good coverage when cooling,easy to move room to room! I am happy with it , thanks!|Positive
Put this unit in a 20' x 5' space. Didn't notice any difference. Fan has very low power in Evap mode. Returned to store.|Negative
The pads fit perfectly, everything shown was delivered and packaging was not damaged.|Positive
The cooler only will get a 3 to 5 degrees temperature drop at best conditions - 98 degrees in with 95 to 94 degree out. I got it to cool my dogs in my sun room. Can I return it?|Negative
"Really effective in our low (25% average) humidity. Very quiet and plenty of airflow on low. Water tank gauge is great. ""Swing"" feature is a nice bonus if you are working outside like I do."|Positive
This like having an ocean breeze on remote control. This is a brilliantly designed swamp cooler and it works perfectly for the purpose it was designed for. It's best used for cooling a room by turning the fan on to the lowest setting with water flow set to maximum (add ice to the flow area on top). You will get the most out of a swamp cooler of this size if you have an existing central air system and you have sections / rooms in your home that you want to cool down without cranking the central air. This will save you a great deal of money on AC if you balance this properly. If you need to cool a house with a swamp cooler then you need to buy one of the giant monsters, put it in a window under a tree or some other natural shade if possible and you will cool a house.|Positive
Product was broken, dented, installed it anyway. Poor quality control knob. Louvers broken. Bad handling or packaging.|Negative
The canvas will last longer than a lightweight material we previously used for this cooler. We're ready for winter.|Positive
This product is a great value. It cools a average size house for less than $500.00 ware as the metal cooler that cools the same size house cost over $600.00, and the body won't last a life time.|Positive
I have experienced evaporative coolers before and have had great results but this one just doesn't work the same. It comes with a reusable ice block to add into the water but it just never seems to actually blow cool air. Even when I add in actual ice to the water. It is just a glorified fan. I am considering returning it.|Negative
Product arrived ahead of schedule. Meets my needs very well.|Positive
These pads are a perfect inexpensive replacement with a perfect fit.|Positive
Came quickly, as described, fit well. Made in USA|Positive
Probably could have been cheaper without all the extra pieces I didn't need. Description made it sound like it was one piece. Turned out to be the two pieces I needed and a bunch of smaller pieces I didn't.|Positive
The air is not as cold as I would like it to be, and it doesn’t cover enough space with cold air.|Negative
Easy to set up and get running. Instructions for operating pushbuttons were very unclear and I am an electrician.|Negative
This product was very simple to install done in less than a few hours, it cools the house great! The only complaint I have about it is when you put the fan on Hi it is really loud and vibrates the window alot. Good news is you don't ever really need to use the fan on Hi, low is perfect and cools quick. It was also awesome to get a rebate! You do have to open a window it will create suction in your house.|Positive
I have been using this product for years. I live in Orange County so my problem is I have to go all the way to Riverside or Fontana to purchase this item. This time at the time of the replacement cooler the float was a real problem to install. It finally works but if I hit the water line it still moves and that is not good. Also it took a long to time to adjust float to keep the right water level. I really need help on what to grease the gears with it says grease but what grease?|Positive
This unit has made our life living the Arizona desert during the summer comfortable and COOL ! I have lived here for 12 years and have always dreaded the coming of summer. we have a larger unit on my roof but it never cooled the house enough so I thought if I purchased the window unit the two together would cool the house better and we would be more comfortable. We live in a two story 1800 square home, after installing this unit in the window downstairs in a matter of minutes we could feel the cool air and within about 30 minutes my home was cool, comfortable and that was without using my main unit on the roof. I purchased this unit over 2 months ago, we have had temperatures over 110 degrees outside and we have only used the window unit. I have no electric grid were I live and rely totally on Solar and wind for power, this unit uses less power and cools my my home much better than my other unit.|Positive
The thermostat and controller seem to work as described.|Negative
very nice and very gooooooooooooooooooood :)|Positive
I placed this unit on the outdoor patio of my bar. The customers are very happy with the amount of air circulation and definite temperature difference. The rollers are big and sturdy to easily maneuver the unit in and out on a daily basis. Definitely worth buying for personal use.|Positive
It's not an air conditioner, but it moves the air in my shop, and makes it feel a little cooler than the 109 degrees we've had lately. When it arrived, one of the hinges on the water fill door was broken, but with my shop and model-making tools, I made it work. Could have been packed better.|Positive
Product works as advertised works great on back patio in this Texas Heat .Only issue I had was shipping wasn't as advertised ended up getting it about a week and a half late.|Positive
Works great easy to I stall|Positive
The unit cooled my 16'x18' patio in south Louisiana by 7 or 8 deg. in 90 to 100 degree weather consistently. Tried a Evaporator Cooler before that only cooled my patio 3 degrees.|Positive
works well, a little loud but very pleased with my purchase|Positive
Good Product with the ability to switch water pump separately from fan speed.|Positive
I could only get my bedroom temp down to 85 using this machine I live in Colorado.|Negative
This is being used in a greenhouse and has worked well.|Positive
First one had bad blower, second one had leaking water tank. Hoping the third one will work properly, check with me in a couple of days|Negative
I was surprised by the size of this unit when it was delivered but luckily it is fairly light weight and comes with wheels so it is easy to move around. For some reason, the kitchen has no A/C vents and faces the sun in the afternoon which makes cooking dinner not fun during the hotter days. I used to position two fans for a cross breeze while cooking but now I simply fill my unit up with cold tap water and set it in the kitchen, open the windows and am able to cook dinner in comfort with the unit blowing cool air around the kitchen. After I'm finished in the kitchen, I turn the unit around to face the family room & get that area cooled down for the evening. Our home A/C sucks up too much power during the summer & over here, we get charged heavily if we use too much power, so I am hoping that the 150 watt energy usage will help keep our summer bill low. It is easy to set up, but I do wish the water level indicator was a bit easier to read and that there was some audible or auto shut off when the water level gets too low. This unit is pretty loud but I'll put up with the noise over being too hot anyday.|Positive
Easy to assemble and use|Positive
Good for a 20 degree temp drop at front (100 F to 80 F). Powerful fan, so much so that I wish the lowest speed was lower still. I have it connected to a 1/4”, continuous feed, waterline because the water tank does last very long. Everything works well. Hope it lasts several seasons.|Positive
Loved it! I was able to open my EVAP Cooler lines and now is working|Positive
The cooler works fine, but seems bigger than I expected - the dimensions are in the product description so anyone can measure the size themselves before ordering. It has two built in handles for easy rolling,|Positive
cooler was easy to put together with included parts and motor install was simple, works great|Positive
This machine is hugeee but luckily portable with its wheels. Works pretty well to cool down the living room area, which isn't that large ~600sq ft, but wow this thing is loud. We live in northern part of NorCal where it does get pretty hot and dry, so using the cooler instead of an air conditioner was something that was new to us. But after extensive researching, we decided to go with the cooler, and we're pretty happy with it. It does make the air more humid due to the water addition, which I don't mind but some folks may not enjoy. Overall, I would recommend. And again, this thing is LOUD, so don't put it near where you want to watch tv.|Positive
Good Product. Easy to Install. Only issue I have found is that they only last about 3 years.|Positive
Awesome swamp cooler,cools the whole house..Recommend to anybody in a dry climate area.Installed in wall and was a bit of work but well worth it.|Positive
Product works perfectly! Thank you!|Positive
We purchased two evaporative coolers for our home, a Honeywell model designed for 325 sq ft for our living room and this one for a small office room. The Luma came with two freezer packs, which was a nice touch instead of using ice to cool the water in the tank. It's also an attractive looking unit - and much more compact for a small room. The tower fits well in tight spaces. The Luma is much noisier than our Honeywell and the air it circulates doesn't get nearly as cool as our Honeywell does. Granted, it is a smaller unit, but is has an annoying motor rattle that just grates on you after a while. Also, the water holding tank on the Luma is awkward to fill and there's a good chance you'll slosh if you're not careful when you slide the tank back in place. I'm not sure about what it'll entail to clean the tank since it doesn't slide out fully. Not thrilled with this model - I'll definitely go with another Honeywell for our next purchase.|Negative
Just purchased this Evap. cooler and am very pleased with its performance. I have read many of the comments about this product and am amused at all the negativity. It is not an Air Conditioner, it is a Evap. cooler, thus it is not expected to work as such. I fill the tank half full with Ice and top off with water and it will blow very cold for at least 2 hours. We have a heat wave here at 110-113 degrees and it works great in a 15x15 room.|Positive
evaporative surface is simply too small for the amount of air the fan moves at any speed, so cooling is limited. It works, and it is better than nothing, the air is slightly cooler and the breeze feels good, but not on par with a good small window unit with 3 large pads. Good for up to 90 degrees or so in very low humidity.|Negative
Bought this to cool an upstairs room and it has exceeded my expectations. Works exceptionally well in the dry air of Salt Lake City and uses very little electricity (uses only 67 watts at max settings). Cooled a 400 sq ft room from 90+ degrees to <80 degrees in 15 minutes. Reasonably quiet, excellent water capacity. Seems well designed and constructed.|Positive
"Great unit, works right out of the box, no problems cooling advertised area in a place with the PROPER humidity levels. Evaporative coolers DO NOT WORK in climates with higher than 50% average humidity, but i see all these sites plagued with bad reviews from people in places like San Diego, who tried to use these units in a ""dry"" or ""less humid"" room. If its 80% outside, then its probably close to that inside. Stop being cheap and buy the right air conditioner for your needs and area, and educate yourself before throwing hundreds of dollars at a device and then complaining that it wouldnt bend the laws of physics for you. That being said, IF you CAN use one of these (50% or less avg humidity, most effective around 15%) then units like this are a GREAT buy. Lowest initial cost and lowest operating cost of nearly any cooling solution out there!"|Positive
Works very well. Easy to install.|Positive
It's really good overall I just wish the air came out colder.|Positive
Today was our first day over 90 degrees. The AF-310 works like a charm. It may not be an air conditioner, but it DOES cool down my apartment. I still wish that the water tank slid out, but I'm very glad I bought it. My long hair kitty likes it, too.|Positive
Works well, doesn't seem to have to work as hard as the air conditioner did and does a much better job. Great for our dry climate. Too bad we had to drive to Cheyenne because our store never has what we need, but that store did a great job with cust.service! Thanks Cheyenne Home Depot!|Positive
it was broken the 2nd year I used it, motor wouldn't turn|Negative
for the price, this was a good investment for the west coast anyway. It keeps the temperature in even a large room cool and my only complaint would be that it is quite loud.|Positive
Well made. Cut out wind wound completely. Tested in 60mph winds for 2 days.|Positive
The pump worked good no problems|Positive
Works very well|Positive
Will have to buy another one as this one only lasted about 6 mos.|Negative
Not what I was expecting from a unit made in the USA.... after only getting to use it for 2 hours the water pump and the water level gauge stopped working. I returned it for a refund !|Negative
Using the swamp cooler in an Orchid Greenhouse in NE Ga. Works well considering our normal humidity. Takes the edge off of the heat. Orchids seem to be doing better since we installed it. Good quality and very easy to set up. Manufacturer Rep was very helpful in making decision on which one to purchase|Positive
Almost replaces actual ac,it's that good or should I say cool.,Very Satisfied,..|Positive
Great unit, very easy to install and start using right away|Positive
Great cooler works great know matter the weather condition.|Positive
After product was installed, we put in the water pump in and it was faulty. We exchanged it,(the pump), and the unit works great.|Positive
it didn't work like it promised the airflow sucked and it wasn't cold even sitting right next to it.|Negative
works like a charm|Positive
This is definitely the way to go. The other sheaves made out of aluminum are too soft and eventually ruin the belt.|Positive
The cover was easy to install and did an excellent job closing the cooler off when not needed this helps to reduce the inside temperature and reduce the load on the air conditioning unit when the owner is on vacation|Positive
Perhaps still too early to review, as it does the job of covering (and protecting) our AC, but surprisingly as the package was opened it emitted a strong chemical odor and gave off a heavy coating of yellow dust on the work clothes and coat when installed. Stay tuned.|Positive
Works really well when Ice cubes are added. Fits perfectly in the small room I'm in.|Positive
set-up was easy and i was able to put it to use immediately. it worked as advertised|Positive
The pads are paper thin, & the mesh covering the pads was poorly on the pads, will never buy again, they are a waste of money|Negative
These pads are just fine for replacement of the factory provided pads, they fit perfectly, and perform just like the factory pads. I wish a better material was used for this purpose since these types of pads have debris that falls off of them and into the reservoir and seem to be generally messy. Perhaps some type of tightly woven plastic material in place of the straw that is used in these pads would work as well without the mess.|Positive
I'm loving my Frigidaire Evaporative Air Cooler and Tower Fan. It wasn't heavy to remove from the box. I love the different settings and speeds, and it comes with a remote control, with the battery included! The water tank is big and I don't have to fill it that often. I use it in my living room and bedroom. Since, I've started using this fan in my bedroom, I haven't had any nose bleeds. My allergies are much better and my mouth and nose don't get dry at all. I have already recommended the Frigidaire Evaporative Air Cooler and Tower Fan, to my friends and family.|Positive
it is a very good unit but the amp draw is way off it is 6.5 not 3.2 as it says steve las vegas nv|Negative
These work fine. If i could get a better one I would, but this is about as good as I can find. Home Depot pricing is good.|Positive
The tracking system didn't work but someone called the day before it was delivered.The cooler has a dent in it. The cooler pads had urine on them and they had to be replaced after running the unit a few days. The stench of urine was terrible and it made my wife almost throw up!!!I would like to get reimbursed for having to buy new cooler pads, the cost was $34.78!!!The cooler works fine, much better than the old one.|Positive
Worked out well. It's a bit bigger than we needed, but as close as we could find across any of the products. Seems well made and we bought some straps to secure it.|Positive
"Used it only a few times before the ""Low Water"" error came on permanently. Horrible quality, and so many reviewers are getting the same error. Friend also bought one and it started squeaking after about 3 uses. This is a defective design. Champion should replace them at no charge."|Negative
Once I turned on the air cooler, it was a blast of cool air. really works!|Positive
WELL DESIGNED PRODUCT--AN UP GRADE FROM THE ONE I PREVIOS LY HAVE.....|Positive
THE PROBLEM WITH THESE PUMP THEY DO NOT LAST VERY LONG, YOU BE LUCK IF THEY LAST A YEAR WHEN USING IT ALL THE TIME.|Negative
Do not buy this piece of garbage, its just a fan with very difficult portability, cannot drag this on a carpet without breaking your back. It does not take the room temperature down, its OK if you sit directly in front of it. Noisy, you bet, like way too loud to even have on while watching TV. Extremely disappointed, and the packing slip, return information clearly states, cannot be returned because of dissatisfaction, just if defective|Negative
great value for the money---I live in West Phoenix, AZ and had experience with vap coolers, both portable and roof top, this product beats them all... hands down...|Positive
I love it...not saying much about the cooling because it depends upon evaporation, and who knows what the real humidity is in there., but it does a fine job as it is. She (the cat) sleeps in front of it, I don't have to water it often, and it has a really neat, easy to use timer to shut it off at night so I don't have to. Delivery service was excellent, and overall...Well worth the money to me.|Positive
The cooler is great while blowing on us but doesn't keep the room cool but muggy. On a higher speed the pump doesnt seem to keep the filters wet enough.|Negative
Just bought mine on 7/10/12 @ 7pm. By 7/11 @ 9pm, the pump stopped working. When it worked, it worked well, but to have it not work any longer after 24 hrs was a bit irritating . Called the manufacturer as instructed in the manual; explained the issue. They advised me to return it to Home Depot for a replacement as it would take 7-10 days for a replacement pump to be shipped.|Negative
Nice unit just too small for what I needed Only negative is hose connector requires an adapter|Negative
The product itself would be great in the right setting, unfortunately my apartment was not it. In that small of a space it would not would not cool and would only add humidity to the air. I will continue to deal with Home Depot and Artic Cool as both companies stood behind their merchandise and helped me to get a product that better suited my needs.|Negative
The right size,the perfect material.AND,it vwas delivered on time and in geat condition.|Positive
There were several problems with the pads and packaging. The package itself was battered when it arrived with clips falling out the bottom. The clips seemed to have been just tossed in the box, not in a bag so it made it easier for the clips to fall out the battered box, luckily we had extra clips. We actually received to sets of pads instead of one (will be returning the extra to Home Depot). The second set was in pieces. The biggest problem with these pads is that they STINK (sort of like the smell your emergency brakes make if you drive with it on for too long) for the first couple weeks you use them, probably longer. The smell was so strong the first week that it gave me headaches if it was on too long. Other that these problems, the pads seem to cool the house well, so for that I am happy but will spend the $20 more for the factory pads the next time.|Negative
Product came early. Had everything except motor and took 10 minutes to set up and get ready.|Positive
I like the new coolers. One was damaged in freight transit. But nothing to bad.|Positive
Once I removed a large metal bar that was rattling around inside blocking the fan it worked fine|Positive
this was the exact replacement for out polar cool .|Positive
Easy setup, easy instructions, keeps the bedroom cool. Best of all my wife isn't complaining about the heat and we can keep the AC at a higher temperature, saving me money. This cooler will pay for its self easily.|Positive
One thing you need to keep in mind is that this is not an air conditioner. It's not going to cool down your small space like an actual air conditioning unit will. You need to add water and ice for a cooler feeling but all in all it just feels like a hard blowing fan. It's pretty loud too. I bought based on reviews compared to other machines. If it's 95 degrees or hotter then this won't help much. Or at least it doesn't in my case. I live in southern Cali with very little humidity. Maybe this product is better suited for more humid areas. I'd give it 5 stars if it were just a fan. It works well as a fan except it's too loud|Positive
I had been looking at the cooler one step below this one. Home Depot had a good sale price and I purchased the 63 pint model. I am using the cooler in a 12'X24' room. This room also has a high ceiling. I wish I had bought the machine earlier in the season. Has no problem cooling this room. Works well, it is very well made. It does make noise. I don't know how you can move lots of air without making noise. It is heavy when full of water. Put it where you want it before you fill it. Very happy with my purchase. DanT|Positive
First of all, it came really fast, which is always a plus. I didn't unpack it, but there were no complaints from my husband, so I assume it was pretty easily done. It is rather large, it comes up to my waist, but I already had an idea of how large it would be thanks to the specifications. It does take a lot of water to fill up, but I view that as a good thing, since you have less time in between fill ups or you can fill 1/2-1 gallon every time you start it up depending on how often/long you use it. The best thing about it is it's very quiet! I was concerned I would not be able to hear anything with this thing going but it's the same amount of noise as a large fan (since that's basically what it is) and you can hear the water dripping down the sides which is very relaxing (especially if you keep it on low, which is all you need most the time). Overall, works well, does a good job of cooling the area (very noticeable difference if going from a room with it to a room without), especially if you are within the path of the air. Makes those 90° days seem much less!|Positive
Fit like a glove|Positive
For the price point this unit is great. Adequate ventilation and placement are important to the overall effectiveness of the unit. We are using this in a small shop and it’s helped out quite a bit.|Positive
Shipping was fast. Even though the included instructions were in Japanese it was easy to set up and use. Kind of noisy but works well to keep our home cool on the hottest of summer days. The sturdy castors make it easy to move around.|Positive
Over all the unit is good, although it is quite noisy even with running it on low.|Positive
Way smaller then I thought|Negative
works great, price was fair|Positive
Purchased and used for about 3 months. Emptied, cleaned and stored for 2 years. Plugged in when Colorado's heat wave of 102-105 is going on, and the pump is done. Tried to repair and that did not work. Called Champion (listed on the manual) They said it has a 1 year warranty. Obviously it's past 1 year, but you can purchase another one for $25.00. If you call, ask to speak to a guy, no offense (being a girl), but the lady knew none of the questions I asked and kept putting me on hold to ask someone else! (Hello, just let me talk to the one who knows the operations of the thing!).. She then proceeded to tell me that If i wanted to purchase it somewhere else (because I told her that I didnt want to buy another one that will only work for 2-3 months). She said to go to Home Depot and ask for one. She didnt have a CFM it's 115v Subm pump. They werent much help. I'm going to find one on Amazon. In the meantime, i cut the tubing in the back at the pump, and put the back of the unit in my shower and soak it. Then put it on. It then works for a couple hours.|Negative
Easy to install. Didn't need a new one I just wanted a white face plate....lol|Positive
So, Out of the box the product must have missed a QC check. The pads installed in the unit had the smell of glue or oil?So i started it off with a flush of the unit. After that, I noticed that the pump ran incredibly slow taking several minutes to cover the pads at all. After running for about 20 minutes (the pads now fully saturated by the pump alone) They now had left a film in the water, this film caused micro bubbles to form, the outward pressure pulled that water, causing the whole unit to spit water all over my shop and items. My losses due to the QC oversight exceeded the cost of the unit... So I had to take the pads out and flush them with a lot of water, and the rest of the unit. After flushing both the unit and pads heavily AGAIN, the pads now saturate in 20 seconds and are ready for use in less then a minute.|Negative
Easy install, works great and is relatively quiet. Good value. My houseis super cool now.|Positive
we love it|Positive
Nice cover, made of very durable canvas and a great fit.|Positive
These work for about 2 years and then die. Not bad at $20 per year.|Positive
AC cover was easy to install. Perfect fit.|Positive
Motor or bearings in new unit are a little louder than my last a/c unit. It does cool though.|Negative
This cooler is a little larger than the old one and seems to work better as well. Runs quite and keeps the house cool.|Positive
"This cooler is very light, 75 pounds without the Media Guard, (that's the back half of the cooler housing that holds the cooling pads). Got it installed myself, lifting it into a window six feet high was no problem. After I got it secured in the window the Media Guard would not go on. I finally figured out that I had to get on a ladder push the Water Distribution Tray under the upper lip of the Media Guard starting on the right side of the tray and working my way back to the hinged end of the tray. I live in the desert, dirt blows constantly. This is going to make it more difficult to clean monthly or to just check on the pumps and water level periodically. I also purchased the inner grill cover. It does not keep the cold night air out. I put a 1/8"" thick piece of padding inside the cover to seal it, you think it would of come with a seal. It pushes air using a fan which is a lot quieter and more efficient than the pulley/drum configuration of most coolers. It was 104 out here a couple of days running last week; on the low setting it kept the house between 65 & 78 depending on the rooms distance from the cooler. In summery the cooler is compact, light, quiet and cools as advertised. But, the fact that the back of the unit doesn't easily mate with the front half and you can't work on it without removing the back half is going to make it a pain to maintain (something to keep in mind before buying). There is a small black plastic tray that holds the controller in the front body of the cooler and it was broken during shipping. I called the people at Essick Air and they were really pleasant. I received the replacement part in a week. Great customer service."|Positive
"Over all the unit is great. not to heavy for 2 people to get on the roof. The metal is a little weak. bent a little getting it on the roof. The ""pre-punch"" hole for the electric hole was not done well. Had to cut through it myself, bent the side pretty good. It does bend back easily. Runs real smooth and Quiet."|Positive
Picked up this motor and install was quick and easy. I did not hear any 60 Hz hum and it is working great here in Arizona!|Positive
I've had the cooler for a month. It works well and runs very smooth. The remote is nice. Adding water to the tank is a bit inconvenient - down low in the back. My space is too large for this size cooler to totally cool so I just move it up close to blow on me.|Positive
This cover is the best choice for me, it fit my swamp cooler correctly and has just survived two weeks of tumultuous weather.|Positive
Easy to use and cranks out some cool! Perfect for SW Colorado dry summer conditions.|Positive
Love the tie down straps! They are made well. Sad the ship to store order was lost and had to reorder. Great product! Left a message for Home Depot Cust Service|Positive
This cooler did not work for me. I called the company and they asked if I understood it needed to work in dry climates. I live in the desert! I guess the water pump did not work. No way to really tell, but it never cooled down or blew cool air. Basically operated just like a fan - a very expensive fan. Very loud fan on settings Medium and High, too loud to watch TV. I returned it.|Negative
We live in Arizona where the heat can be brutal at times and have used a window A/C for years. We were looking to save a little $ on our electric bill and decided to try the Bonaire Durango Evap.Cooler. It was easy to install and works like a champ, keeps our house very cool and comfortable. We will now only use our a/couple when we have monsoons. Very happy with the unit and money we will be saving|Positive
The new float was exactly right.|Positive
Perfect ready for use, just need the motor, I did not use the recommended 1/3, I put a 1/2, Money.!!!!!|Positive
Not big enough. Had to fill water so much. Should of spent the extra and got bigger unit.|Negative
This grill is adequate and gets the job done. There’s nothing fancy about it. Constructed of PVC like plastic. Comes fully assembled along with mounting screws. For the price I wish it were enameled aluminum but it’s not. This is the only one carried by THD in my market so...|Positive
I purchased this cooler for my garage since it gets so hot in the summer. I am very happy with it. Full tank will last a couple hours so I just keep the hose hooked up to it. For the money it is a perfect unit. It also has a button that moves the air side to side without the unit moving itself.|Positive
Product arrived on schedule. It was as described and was installed same day.|Positive
What a great way to cool down the house, My friends helped me install this unit a week ago, and tested it out when we finished, I was very impressed with how quickly it cooled the place down, it was very quiet too, the remote feature is very convenient as well. It stays up over 100 everyday in the summer so it will make it much more tolerable.|Positive
It cools within minutes. Had it for a few weeks, having to put water in it is not as constant as a thought.|Positive
Cooler is very noisy not much difference when going from low to high and dose not cool very well using in a one bedroom apt not satisfied at all :-(|Negative
The unit installed easily in a front room window and operates as advertised but the operational cost is high. The unit draws 5.26 amps AC at full operation with a power factor of .63. A similar and somewhat larger unit from a different manufacturer uses 2.61 amps at full operation and has a power factor of .99 and moves more air in CFM. I feel the efficiency of the AC motor is woefully low and will mean the unit will cost much more to run over it's lifetime.The very low power factor on the unit's motor is inexcusable what with todays computer aided design for AC motors. For that reason I do not recommend this unit for purchase.|Negative
This set of MasterCool pads for our evaporative cooler are working great! They fit our unit, as advertised.|Positive
allows the wind and cold to come through.|Negative
"This 40"" X 40"" X 31"" Evaporative cooler down draft cover is an excellent product for the money was able to withstand the harsh So. Calif. sun all summer without showing any sign of the fabric deterioration of the fabric, Reenforced double stitching on all seams and around the cover and a adjustable cord to keep it secured from flying off, Water resistant fabric."|Positive
Product fit as described. Price was decent. I do wish it came with a water disperse to media to go across the top.|Positive
I always go to Home Depot to get this replacement for my cooler. I know they will have it I have never had to return or replace mid summer.That's why I keep coming back.|Positive
This unit is outstanding! The performance and cooling power this evaporate cooler amazed me! Great for keeping my employees cool in the heat of summer. Highly recommended!!|Positive
This cooler was easy to set up, it works well and is quiet. I am glad I purchased this product from Home Depot. It was a quick delivery and no shipping charge.|Positive
I've only had the unit for 30 days and it seems to operate as advertised. I'm not sure that it actually cools 1600 square feet. Smaller areas would be better.|Positive
It went on easy enough,but the first one I bought leaked all over, I traded it in (with no hassles) and this one works great. no leaks. I would buy this again.|Positive
product met specifications|Positive
"Excellent cooler. My old cooler would take about 10 degrees off outside temperature on ""High Cool."" This cooler takes 15 degrees off at ""Low Cool."" Haven't even needed the high setting at all in a very hot summer. Thank you."|Positive
Purchased with a little doubt in mind that considering the low price it might not work as well as the other higher priced items. But surprisingly I feel it functions just as well as the others. Would definitely recommend to others.|Positive
Was as expected. Fit perfect.|Positive
This thing is a joke. 550 square feet? This won't even cool 50 square feet. If you put ice water in it and point it directly at yourself, you will get some relief from the heat. But don't expect it to cool down even a small room. Unpacking it is cumbersome because they cram the pedestal inside the unit. You gotta figure out how to take the back off without damaging the water hose inside to get it out. Then, good luck getting it to go back together properly. Seriously NOT worth the money. Spend a little more and get something that works.|Negative
Easy to install and fit perfectly .Shipping was free to store.|Positive
Insufficient to supply mastercool cooler.|Negative
Wanted the very best float so I wouldn't have issues and this one will not shut off after 2 months use. very poor quality|Negative
Im in Miami, people says is not going to work in a humidity area, is not like that, the air is very fresh and feels near of an AC not very cold but very very fresh, i love it, the cons is the material is weak plastic, came with some areas broken|Positive
although you stock several types of floats I find that purchasing a lesser priced one works just as well for this project since the water in san Bernardino is so poor quality you wind up replacing float yearly so why spend twice the price when its lifetime is limited no matter what the quality of product. One thing I would like to add is that living in southern calif the heat is always high & keeping a light inventory of inexpensive swamp cooler parts through the year would greatly ad value to my opinion of the DEPOT!!! ben terry|Positive
So I was pretty sure this would work based on the majority of reviews, but of course couldn't be sure until I tried it out. Works great - we live in a small single-wide mobile home (12' x 46'...yeah I know but it's home, has been for 30+ years and I love it here, lol), anyway our roof-mount evap cooler can't be used right now due to a bolt that broke, so we ordered a replacement evap cooler, and our regular contractor we used said he'd install, so we picked it up and now he can't be found. OMG I work at home and have my fur babies inside with me so roasting is out of the question and on a few hot weekends it has been 86-88 inside and absolutely stifling! So I first ordered a little portable evap cooler by Frigidaire since I love our refrigerator by same mfg., and had high hopes. But it didn't cool a square foot I don't think - I guess it's like buying a little clip-on desk fan with the anticipation of circulating air in the whole house - just cannot happen. So back it went. I'd been looking at this Hessaire too, and wish I'd decided on it originally, but then I wouldn't have appreciated it as much as I do. The first day it had the living room at 78 and the kitchen (where my desk is, lol) at 79 or 80 I think, which is a huge improvement from 86!! I think on the 3rd day of using, in the afternoon I noticed it didn't seem to be cooling as much as it had been, so I decided to drain out the water and hose off the media pad the next morning. So I did that and it's working great again! Something I wanted to share is that after you remove the back panel/media pad, you can then see inside where all the connections are; the wiring, pump, motor, etc. - kinda cool. So I thought why not just tip it toward the back, inside of the tub, to drain, and also what about spraying it out with shower head? SO thankfully I called manufacturer. She said use the drain plug to guard against any kind of splashing getting on the electronics. Aha! I hadn't thought of that, and she said I could use the shower head as long as I used it very gently and did not splash. So I turned shower head on really low so it was gently spraying out, and guided it ONLY in the water receptacle bottom and there was not enough pressure for water to splash anywhere. After it drained I then carefully tipped back and side-to-side to allow all remaining water to go out the drain plug opening. Worked perfectly and I put the drain plug back in. After bringing it back out to kitchen (near open window), I actually re-filled it before putting the back of it back on which was nice...put it back together and viola!, works great again. The water had been very murky when I opened it up the first time too, so what I suggest, and what I will do in the future, is any time you get a new media pad (or upon delivery of this brand new unit I should have), is to hose off the back panel/media pad (you have to remove it first and do it outside or in the tub). I think just whatever is on it during manufacturing, and the dust that accumulated while using for the first few days needed to be addressed. Now I will do this at least every 2 weeks or every week if needed. It took less than 10 minutes and now that I know how to do it I won't be so scared to touch it! lol Some have mentioned issues about the door to re-fill the unit. I have no problems with it, but don't push it in after closing it - just gently close it and it will close without having to be pushed in (husband did that and then it was hard to get open, so just sharing...). Our home has 552 square feet total, and with unit being in kitchen (far east end) facing in toward rest of house, the only place it doesn't get to very well is the very back bedroom, which is fine. The bathroom (just before bedroom) door is open and that window is open so it's guided through to there since you I can feel the air in the hallway. And this is on low, so maybe on high it will go a little more in the bedroom, but that's not my main concern as I have a great fan in there. I'm so happy I got this. I was going to consider the next step up in Hessaire models if this one did not work as well, but I'm happy I don't have to do that. If you live in a little larger space you could get multiple units and place throughout. They will work, just do as instruction manual says and put near open window/door, and open some other windows to evenly distribute air throughout area, and send moist cooled air back outside, which keeps humidity down. Since we have always had a roof-top evap cooler, I know what to expect and what not to expect out of these, so if it's humid outside it's not going to work as well on cooler setting. I just switch to fan in late afternoon if it starts to get humid. The model that is a step-up from this one has a remote control, humidity control, and covers 700 square feet, but it costs about $150 more too, so for us this smaller one is perfect. If we were to ever go on a long day trip we'd hook up the hose to it through the window so we wouldn't have to worry about having neighbor fill it up. If using on high for entire day you'd fill probably twice. On low you'd fill once. Just keep your eye on water level. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS!!!! AAA+++ :)|Positive
compared favorably to a larger much more expensive unit, and pumps a huge amount of water. it is an nexpensive solution to swamp cooler repair.|Positive
We bought this as a replacement for a unit that died after only 2 years. Impressive performance so far. A little smaller than the unit it replaced, it still works well.|Positive
This evaporative cooler does what it is advertised to do. We had a warm day yesterday with a high of 77 degrees. When I turned it on last night the inside temperature was 74 degrees so I turned on the cooling setting and the fan to 2nd speed. This morning the temperature in my house was 68 degrees but in my bedroom it was 61 degrees. I like it cool and that seven degrees makes a lot of difference in my sleeping. The only improvement I would make is a more readable water level indicator as that is hard to read in a darkened room.|Positive
Did not cool our daughter's bedroom at all. Just produced air but no different than a tower fan. Returned and bought a window ac instead.|Negative
The best kind in cooler pumps|Positive
"We wanted to do 2 things this summer 1 lower our power bill and add more moister in the house. This cooler has done both It uses a bit of water especially because of the hard water here in Boulder city, We also installed a purge pump that pumps about 5 gallons of water out every 6 hours of cooler running time. It is a DIAL 1540 115V Purge Pump. I ran the discharge line over into my garden so no waste there either. There was also a rebate from the city of $230 on this unit. So check with your power company. The cooler works great except when we get high humidity out then you have to switch back to normal ac. Only 4 days this year so far. I also installed a thermostat with the unit that keeps the temperature correct it is a Lux WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat..You can order them through Home Depot but I got mine on Ebay. The wifes only problem with the cooler is she says it's to cold in the house. The unit is fairly quiet for the amount of air it puts out 4300 cfm and we did install it through the wall. We just cut it through as it fits between the studs on a 16"" center. Also dropped the plug down under the cooler from the light switch next to the unit. I would recommend this unit if you live in a dry area.."|Positive
Lightweight and easy to use. Rolls to any location. Easy to operate controls.|Positive
Fit correctly, seemed to run the cement mixer (heavy duty one) without any problems. Have yet to give it the acid test, but so far so good.|Positive
it was easy to install and was working very good|Positive
These are great for a small off-grid solar powered house. Has a small 8HP motor. I've installed three of these units permanently in the walls of houseshouses ranging from 400sq ft to 800sq ft|Positive
Very good product, It's a replacement for my old unit. That lasted thirteen years, I installed it stationary thru my wall for my garage. It's great and best of all It's made in the USA. Stay Cool|Positive
Purchased this unit 11 days ago and today it has started to leak. I've tried every adjustment, cleaning filters, water reservoirs, new positions, different floor surface but it still continues to leak. The troubleshooting section of the manual doesn't even include leaking as an issue. Will have to wait and see if I get any response from the trouble ticket I created on the Arctic Cove website.|Negative
Not sure if this item was defective but only droplets would pump out of it. I replaced it with a larger unit and it worked just fine.|Negative
What can I say about a 52” swamp cooler belt other than it works as it should. The price was right.|Positive
Product was damaged, got refund.|Negative
VERY WELL DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ADEQUATE FOR MY NEEDS.|Positive
this cover fit well, and is sturdy and well made, thank you|Positive
Boy does this put out the air. The high CFM rating on this really makes a difference in our open living room/kitchen/dining room area. When humidity is low (under 40%) this machine cools that area down wonderfully. When it is over 40% it is useless, but that is to be expected with a swamp cooler.|Positive
This works well in my shop. I have huge port-a-cools, but you can't maneuver them like this smaller unit.|Positive
Good for hard water on the grates but cleaning the tank weekly is a good idea.|Positive
I recommend this product, but there are qualifications. You need to be mechanically inclined and have some patience. At least with mine, just out of the box it is complete junk. First, the float unit was adjusted incorrectly, so that the tank overflowed. On top of that, the float can not be adjusted so that the tank actually fills properly. There is a slot that the float arm goes down through, and the arm will hit the slot before the tank gets filled. The float has to be adjusted so that the valve shuts off before the float arm hits the end of the slot, so the tank cannot be filled to the normal level. When you get done fixing this, the little gauge that shows the water level will only go to about 3/4 full. Second, the water pump is held to the bottom of the tank with suction cups. The pump had come loose during shipping and was laying on it's side. When the tank level problem has been fixed, the pump will suck air. Obviously, this was a simple fix after I realized what the problem was. Third, the water spreaders on the side panels are defective somehow, and only feed water to about half of the pad, toward the edges. I haven't repaired this yet, as it looks like I will have to remove the top of the cooler housing, so I'm letting it go until another day. In conclusion, the shame of all this is that this cooler is very reasonably priced for the performance. If it were assembled properly, they could easily charge enough to pay the cost. It would be even more of a bargain for the slightly higher price.|Negative
Although the original pad in my Bonaire unit gave me great service for 6 years. The first replacement I ordered came in a box that looked like it had been run over. The customer service rep. apologized and reordered one. I asked that it be over boxed(original box put in a larger box). She noted that in my order. The replacement came in original box with all 4 corners crushed. In disgust I left the orange store and went across the street to the blue store and bought a new cooler.|Negative
We live in Arizona and summer temperature reach well over 100. 118 was the highest so far this year. We used the evaporative cooler in our garage and even at night when temperatures had dropped the cooler did not cool the garage down enough to make it comfortable. This product may work better for different climates but it is not worth it if you live in southern Arizona.|Negative
Like the size and removable tank. Water port is not made well-- small and plastic latch. Will fill by removing the top from the tank. Has worked well so far. Latch design should have come off the tank instead of the top. Latches can flop down when picking up top and catch on tank when you pull lit up. Not a big problem but need to be careful.|Positive
Fan I had on my desk was loud and blew my hair around and distracted me. More importantly, though, blowing hot air at me did not help. This unit has made my space cool and pleasant.|Positive
This is our second purchase of this model. Use it to keep us cool when we our on the patio. Makes our high desert home more tolerable in summer.|Positive
It arrived, took out of box. Read instructions, filled with 5 gal of water. Turned it on and it didn’t work. Water pump broken.|Negative
"This is my third champion cool , 2nd of this model. Great production. Frustration: IF MOUNTING VERTICALLY YOU NEED TO PRE ORDER ""Convertible grill allows vertical or horizontal installation (call 800-643-8341 for free kit)"" THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED AND IF YOU GO TO THE STORE CUSTOMER SERVER / COOLER EXPERT WILL NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AND OR HOW TO HELP YOU."|Positive
This canvas cover turned out to be a nice surprise. Instead of tying the corners together like other products I've used in the past this one had a nice velcro seam. It keeps out the weather better. Use the suggested straps and you have the most secure cover setup I have ever had. This canvas version also holds better than those other lighter weight greenish versions that desintegrate after one winter of storage. After two years in a row of that I wanted a canvas version.|Positive
blows hot air|Negative
Moderate cooling. Not great but better than a fan. Arrived with hoses detached and had to be disassembled and fixed.|Negative
I bought it for a small bedroom. It never cooled off the room. Worked like a regular fan.|Negative
This is the second one I've had, and the material deteriorates from the elements a little faster than I'd like. It fits, but it's not easy to put the unit.|Negative
It worked as advertised.|Positive
Works as it should! Took about 15 minutes to install and about 15 minutes to clean up the mess from cutting hole in ceiling!|Positive
I am using in a RV. It is doing a fair job at keeping my RV cool. Don't know how well it will work when it gets hot. I live in Arizona where it can get to 120 or above.|Positive
Easy to setup and use. Cools reasonably well, but humidity goes up, making the room feel muggy. Rather noisy on High speed. Satisfied but not greatly impressed.|Negative
Exactly what I needed. Compared online, this was the best price and a good quality product.|Positive
Drop in replacement for my other 7500. Works great! Starts up every time! Don't be fooled by the blue color, It's actually orange just like the original pumps in the coolermasters and Dial Coolers.|Positive
works very well may be overkill|Positive
This is a great product|Positive
"Simple clips to hold a motor in it's ""resilient mount"" and they did the job swimmingly."|Negative
seems more a fan then anything. perhaps it might work in very small spaces.|Negative
Keeps the cold air during cold season, great product, perfect fit|Positive
Very satisfied with this product and service provided. Will purchase from this vendor again. Pickup at Home Depot was easy.|Positive
We have been customers of Home Depot for many years, although this is the first time we have ordered anything online. The service, delivery, pick up and phone communication was exemplary. However, the unit was noisy at the highest level and did not deliver the cooling we expected.|Negative
Leaked water everywhere onto the floor and did not cool off my place even though the climate is dry LA heat. It was a hassle to return as they didn't have the right SKU in the system.|Negative
The electrical parts fit together well an d were easy to assemble.|Positive
Easy to hook up. Works perfectly.|Positive
Very loud fan, even on low speed. Some reviews made it sound like that was not a problem but it is way to noisy for in the house. It does not move as much air as would be expected for a 3100 cfm rating and the noise it makes. We only wanted to cool two rooms and opening a window in each did not result in much air movement across the two rooms. You can feel the coolness standing in front of the fan but it does not flow very far from the unit. The water filling door is very small and makes it hard to pour water into the unit without spilling a little. We are going to keep the unit and try moving it around the house to see if we can improve its performance by finding a better location, so it moves air across the two rooms we want to cool. For the noise it makes and the low air flow I think a window mounted unit would have been a better choice, even for just the two rooms.|Negative
"This cooler is a better value than anything offered on Amazon. The price was fantastic and it has a few options that make it easier to use. Like being able to set the fan on a timer, when you are done with the cooling part, to dry the pad and hopefully keep it from getting funky. Also the filling spout is large enough to allow me to drop in my larger 2"" ice cubes if you want to cool the water. The greatest thing I experienced was the delivery. I ordered online July 2nd at 7:31 pm. It arrived July 3rd at 11:51 am. Scheduled delivery date was July 10-12, so this may have been an anomaly, but it made my day!!!"|Positive
Worked just fine..|Positive
The unit works and cools great. The only issue is when the pump is running and on high, water is also pushed out. May be an issue if used inside. Would recommend to buy.|Positive
This cover seems a bit thin but was well designed from what I could tell. I had no issues tieing it down and there's tons of rope left over so nobody will be having issues with it reaching anywhere. It was a pretty good fit (being bigger rather than smaller). We'll see if it holds up...|Positive
Fan great but can't tell how good cooling will be since we're in high dew point season. Great price also|Positive
The pump is working great and the swamp cooler is back to cooling my home.|Positive
Quiet powerful fan. Cooled some in No Va but in high humidity not a huge drop in temperature. Liked better than New Air because it was easier to get the water compartment in and out. P|Positive
I have a 10 year old good condition AC. In San bernardino this thing keeps my house at 77 on a 100 degree day. When in the 90s and 80s it actually makes it cold, I have seen the thermostat drop to 65 when in the mid 80s. Don't worry about water consumption I already got my bill and I was within tier 1 still and I have a lawn to water as well that this thing drains to. Only complaint is there should be a super low setting, low is still a wee bit loud and makes it too cold at night. 1400 square foot house here.|Positive
very nice device, specially when it's hundred degrees outside--thank you|Positive
My motor was not big enough for my commercial evaporative cooler. Not sure why only a 1/2 was installed for my work building, but that's what we previously had. Now you can truly feel the difference and sometimes I find myself getting really cold in my office. The motor looks pretty solid and stable for years to come.|Positive
I like these pads much better than the set that came with the cooler. These pads seem to let more air flow through, they don't have that terrible smell that normally comes with new aspen pads when you first put them in. The netting is exceptional at keeping the aspen in the pad and not floating in the water. They are very affordable! I bought 5 sets so I can change them every month since we have hard water where I live. They have been in for two weeks now and doing a fantastic job. Maybe I won't have to change them as often as I thought. I loved the ease of ordering them online before the season started and picking them up at the store. I like their performance better than the blue pads I used last season.|Positive
The original pads lasted 5yrs, we'll see how long these last. The pads for my old cooler cost half as much, but they weren't as efficient and only lasted 2yrs. The biggest hassle replacing the pads was getting the cover off and back on. changing the pads themselves was a peice of cake.|Positive
Works better than I thought . Great product!|Positive
Loved it. This is the perfect size for inside my house. I use it to add humidity when it is really dry during the hot months of summer and it helps cool at the same time. Good Product.|Positive
I was surprise by how powerful it is. I'm learning how to best use it, but im very pleased with it|Positive
Sure, it can't cool your whole home but this is the 3rd summer in which we have not used our central air. We are in So. Cal. and live in a 2 story home & it's too expensive to cool it. We now have 4 evap coolers, one for each of 3 bedrooms & one in our family room. I can run these as much as I want and not have to borrow to pay my electric bill. Figure I save on avg. of $100 each month of the summer. Yes, this unit gives off an oder at the beginning but it was gone in a couple of days. Love the digial controls! Highly recommend it!|Positive
Have been trying to get my parent to update for years and it finally worked. This product does the same size as there old one but about 3/4 to 1/2 the size. It is quite and works great in there house.|Positive
My brand new cooler was damaged upon pick up at store. I was discounted 48.00 as credited back to my cc. I was disappointed as I didn't like the idea of purchasing a new cooler to then look like the old ugly one on My roof. After cooler installed only 7 days up on roof running we heard a loud noise. I had to call out the handyman to find the stock belt that runs through pulley was defective in two spots. So I had to pay the handyman to go buy a new belt. So not too happy to start. However cooler seems to be running ok so far. Hope this experience gets better and remains so.|Negative
This is a good switch! It switches smoothly and operates just as described. Made solidly and I like that it is made for a regular wall switch mount rather than a double gang box. I did find one a little cheaper but it was online and I would have had to wait. For $0.40 extra, I can make the trip!|Positive
Really loud, cheap looking and feeling. Really does not cool with the ice oack in. Returning it.|Negative
The photos of the shows grommets to secure the bottom edge, the picture had 8 we only had 4. Which mean the bottom wil allow wind to come Dow the opening into the house.|Negative
Has never worked got new pump still not working why do In have to make repairs on a new unit? Customer service less than helpful. I want to return it but it's heavy and HD is 80 miles away so it's a complete hassle.Maybe it's great if it works but mine doesn't so I'd stay away from this piece of junk cause if it's this much work New can you imagine after a few years|Negative
This cooler works great but putting ice in it was a little difficult with bigger chunks. It need a bigger opening. Doesn't cool as much as I hoped for after the ice melts. Other than that it works great. I should buy another one so I don't have to haul this one back and fourth to the cabin and the house.|Positive
The product was as expected. There was minor damage to the packaging and pads.|Positive
Motor installed in swamp cooler for at 2,150 sf house. Works great.|Positive
Not sure if this is bonafide Bonaire pump, i spend my morning putting this pump in only to find out it doesn't pump strong enough. very weak pump. Now I'll have to order another pump but this time from Bonaire|Negative
Answer foe those 3 questions I see, there is no stand to hold it outside, you need to buy chains to hook it from the side of the roof or you need to build your own stand. I had 2 different sizes of swamp coolers, so be careful with dimensions then won't fit on your window|Positive
Very pleased with the quality and the ease of installation. The sales people were so helpful and friendly!|Positive
Cooled room instantly, last s good 8hrs before having to refill reservoir.|Positive
The instructions suck, the fan motor is loud even in low speed, the float valve is useless.Installation is a challenge to the patience.It took me 3 hours to install including a trip to buy a new float valve. it cools fine.Too loud for a living room area. I have installed in my backyard porch.|Negative
This will work but it wont last like the heavy duty brown cavas type,that you used to carry . this is real thin and flimsy may last a year.|Negative
I find that these pumps are made to fail. They last a year and are gone.|Negative
It was to install, works great and definitely a fair price.|Positive
It helps to cool a small room up to 300 Square feet, it will be loud for this size room. Problem is continuing to put ice to make it nice and cool but it is far better than nothing. I have purchased larger units that was not as good and triple the price.|Positive
I am from the east coast so when I moved to Arizona for school I was definatley in for a shock. I knew it could get hot but I was totally unprepared for Arizona heat. To make matters worse the way my room was situated in my apartment I would have to keep the ac on 65C just to cool my room properly. Needless to say the SRP bills would be through the roof. I was getting desperate since I couldn't sleep at night, developed allergies, had previously controlled asthma go out of control and heat induced migraines started to become more and more frequent. I started searching for a portable AC unit and found this one. After reading over a hundred reviews and otherwise researching I decided to purchase it. After all I could return it if it didn't work. I set it up immediately (was please that the only thing I had to do was take it out the box and plug it up-no assembly required). This product is simple to use...no 300 page manual here. I had it up and running in less than 10 minutes and that including taking it out of all the packaging it came in. I filled it with water and ice as instructed and let it run. I immediately felt a difference. That night I honestly slept all the way through the night for the first time since arriving in Arizona 6 months ago. I could breath, was not congested the next morning with itchy water eyes. This thing does everything it claims. Even my room was cooler. This model works so well that my roommate (who has the same issues I do only worse) sat in front of it for 15 min while it was running and was able to go back to her room and sleep the entire night problem free. Needless to say we immediately ordered her one. One note though- this is NOT an air conditioning unit. You wont get the same results as if you were running an actual ac unit. This is an air cooling unit..it will cool air but only so much. If your looking to make a room 60 degrees when its 105 degrees outside, this isn't the product for you. But if you have a room that's warmer than normal (mine was consistently above 80 on a good day) and just need it lower (mine is at 75 now) this could work for you.|Positive
It works ok thought it would do better|Positive
I have changed pads and added zinc anode but didn’t notice a change in the odor.|Negative
Cools our 300 sq. ft. room very well, from 82 to 72 on low in about an hour. The water tank size is sufficient to last through the afternoon.|Positive
the motor froze up for no reason, putting the water in it was a chore|Negative
New motor working well.Cooler working well.|Positive
Worked as expected|Positive
I love these coolers. mine is a 3 speed. have had several brands of these. Have learned the pump will last a lot longer if you use soft water or tablets for descale purposes if your water is very hard, which it is here in AZ. Am using one in the garage for a colony of cats I caretake.|Positive
Fit good went on easy|Positive
Quick and easy to install for a person with intermediate handy skills.|Positive
I am an HVAC engineer and the biggest problems with this unit is the motor and fan blade are poor quality parts from China. Within a week, the unit started running louder and louder. It was making a high pitched noise and got so loud that it kept us awake at night, when the unit was on the other side of the house. It cooled really well though. Master Cool should put a better quality motor and get a better machined fan blade that isn't jagged edged plastic, then this product would be great. Ended up returning this unit.|Negative
Upgraded this past June 2018 to this model-4700 cfm side draft window mount 2 speed-high/low. Here it is mid of sept 2018 and and high speed/flow has stopped working . So now only a low speed is working, and low volume of air is coming out. I would not recommend buying this product.|Negative
It worked out great. Much better than what came with cooler!|Positive
The cover is heavy-duty, and looks like it will hold up well, in harsh weather. It has a sewn-in cord, along the bottom edge, so you can cinch it up, helping to prevent it from blowing away. My only complaint is that nowhere on the home depot web page, advertising this cover, is this built-in cord mentioned. Due to this omission, I purchased the optional hold down straps, which in my case, might not have been necessary.|Positive
It was difficult to pull the drawstring tight in order to tie the covers on the ventilator.|Positive
Well built. A little dented otherwise I would give 5 stars.|Positive
I love all of the features and would recommend to a family member or friend.|Positive
To be fair, it looked like a great device. However, it was much larger than I expected, and I returned it for refund.|Positive
Works just right , easy to install, easy to oil great product|Positive
Instructions are a little lacking. I installed it in a wall and it is a little tight to get the cover back on after servicing the inside. It keeps my 1200 sqft three story house cool in the summer unless it's really hot outside. I've only used it a few times last summer, but it seemed to work really well. It wastes a lot of water. The larger units are more efficient with water. I diverted the siphon so only a portion of the water is wasted. I'll just clean the media more frequently. The water bill did jump before I diverted the water siphon. I would buy it again. PS the initial swampy smell goes away quickly.|Positive
not satisfied with this purchase/it DIDNT COOL as my husband expected it to. I will return itemthank you|Negative
Work great very high quality|Positive
It does exactly what it is supposed to and keeps my washing machine dry.|Positive
Excellent product quality and price point. A solid value. I recommend the product and would re-purchase without hesitation. Thank you!|Positive
A good strong product....Could have been longer in height as to tuck under the downdraft cooler. Maybe will stay on with our strong winds. Chemical smell is strong but needed for weather proofing? Thanks Brian for your product.....|Positive
Just love the new cooler, installed it in a few hours, was worried about the noise levels from some of the reviews I read, but very happy to say it's very quite and cools very well where I'm located in North Fork Ca.|Positive
Very dissapointed. I measured the air tempature in the room and at the fan and it didn't change. It never got cooler. I live in Arizona so it should have worked well in the desert. It just increased the humidity in the room.|Negative
I really like this product, its not bulky, cools the house quickly. I had a friend install it, it seemed easy enough, and it arrived quickly Thanks|Positive
accurate replacement for my unit. I found just the right one based on the size of my cooler|Positive
great, very pleased. wish I could buy another. thank you|Positive
Great fit|Positive
As noted in other reviews. this unit has a very loud fan. On the other hand IT WORKS. This unit cools my kitchen and dining area, plus my living room. It appears that it produces a 16 to 18 degree temperature reduction from outside air temperature. That means if it's 95 outside, it's high 70s inside. For higher temperatures, I supplement with a small A/C unit in the kitchen. The best practice has been to cool things down into the 60s in the early morning. The temperature will rise during the day, but starting off that cool means that unless the temperature is over 100 things will stay comfortable all day. Not recommended if you're going to spend extended periods in the rooms being cooled due to the high noise levels, and very strong breeze. I have a room with A/C that I spend most of my time in. But the kitchen is kind of a necessity for cooking and baking which I can now do in early evening rather than after midnight. Please note: I live in high desert so we have very low humidity, which is the ideal operating environment for an evaporative cooler.|Positive
Perfect fit for Mastercool model 7112. Needs to have Velcro side slit to allow wrapping around conduit to disconnect switch on side of cooler. Otherwise the conduit creates a bulge on side of cover. Bottom string could be longer. However, the cover is large enough to accommodate covering a disconnect switch on the side of the Mastercool unit.|Positive
The product was an excellent fit.|Positive
"The pads that were purchased at Home Depot are of high quality. They have kept our home cooler than other years,plus we have not experienced the ""horrid"" smell that comes from turning off and on the A/C. Great product."|Positive
did not fit|Positive
This was a noisy machine and worked like a high speed fan. Did not do the job for the room I was trying to cool, which receives direct sunlight for about 5 hours a day. On the flip side, it was super easy to install and operate.|Negative
I used this cooler all season and I must say that it exceeded my expectations. It kept my 1000 sq, ft. home very comfortable all summer, and the only time that I ran it on high was the first day, just to make sure it worked on all speeds. I bypassed the water bleed to conserve water and had minimal scale buildup. I can highly recommend this unit.|Positive
We have used a swamp cooler for 30 years in CALIF. Now living in SW Idaho, we are stuck with all electric heating/cooling unit that would cost $7-8K to replace. Being on a fixed income, we needed to save money. This slim-line unit uses 1/4 of the electricity and saves us $300 per month during the sultry summer months. It's light weight and much easier to install than the bulky units. Two screw on the bottom, and one bracket beneath the unit on the inside of the window tacks onto the sill. The three speed setting is awesome! Our home has vaulted ceilings and is 1,600 sq feet. By leaving bedroom windows cracked approximately 6 inches, it draws the cool air down the hallways, and keep the interior between 72 and 74 degrees all day long. We turn it on BEFORE 11 am when the sun hits hard on the roof...and we keep the living room ceiling fan on to distribute the breeze. We purchased the PURGE PUMP which dumps the circulated water via a drain hose every six hours to keep a clean fresh smell and bacteria to a bare minimum. A 1/4 cup of bleach added once a month insures no bacteria or stale smell. All swamp coolers are fairly noisy, but this one is far quieter than the bulky ones from the past. If placing the unit in a room where the TV Volume is an important factor (simply turn it onto LOW)....our unit is in the kitchen which opens via an archway into the living room.....therefore, the TV volume is not an issue.... We used foil coated Styrofoam insulation (easy to cut and keeps bugs out) to place in void spaces around the openings in the window, and THEN we hid the foil face with the accordion side pleats included in the box....the sticky tape provided works fine as long as the STRETCH factor to fit the void space does not need to expand too far...if so, simply tack into place with tiny screws or carpet tacks into the wooden window trim and tiny screws into the actual portion of the unit that enters the house. We're thrilled to have an attractive unit on the outside of the house, as opposed to the METAL MONSTERS of the past. Our electrician came to hook up our hot tub, walked into a cool house when it was 104 outside and ended up buying a unit for his home. It has paid for itself in the first 6 weeks of use; as opposed to giving the $500. to the electric company!|Positive
Good product for the price. I'm happy!|Positive
While this unit was not the same as the one we had before, it was pretty easy to install.|Positive
does not work when i am trying to cool a 8x12' shed. made room hot and humid, and yes i ventilated the room|Negative
Pretty straightforward and simple to use. Does well in my 3 car garage. Much easier to store than others because of it's depth.|Positive
This swamp cooler works okay. The float valve was defective and as of today 6-12-12 (3 weeks!) I'm still waiting for a replacement from Champion! Terrible customer service!|Negative
Arrived quickly. Thanks!|Positive
My roomy is happy. Keeps the 100 + degree days live able and noticeably cooler than without. He notices improvements even without ice.|Positive
Has strong smell that lasts more than a week. powerful but the ice melts too fast therefore machine is used as aregular fan.|Negative
This swamp cooler has been absoultey amazing for the summer heat! It really helps cool our studio down and is a great energy efficient alternative to purchasing an AC.|Positive
It's nice but too big for my liking because I wanted to travel with it. If I can get a sizeable one,, that would excellent. Thanks, hope to hear from you.|Positive
One the initial break in period is over, the new media made a nice difference. When I first turned on the cooler I thought something was on fire. Then I read this was normal to have an odor. Be ready to open the windows and airy he house out, they stunk badly. It took a few days for the odor to completely disappear, and I cycled the cooler to let the water drain multiple times. This is normal from what I've read.|Positive
Home Depot doesn’t stock this item so it has to be shipped. When I received it I had to do some minor set up. Once I got it going it started shooting water out from the front. I called manufacturer and did some trouble shooting in which nothing got resolved. They told me to take it back to Home Depo|Negative
These belts always work very well and last a couple of seasons. The only ones I buy.|Positive
This motor was easy to install and operates very quietly. I gave this motor 4-stars because its only been operating for a few days, not sure about longevity which is very important to me. I guess the major plus was its in stock and available when I needed it. I will update later for the longevity aspect of this review.|Positive
Excellent product! Sized exactly right with quality construction! Arrived at store in just a few days after ordering. I highly recommend this cover!|Positive
In a low humidity, high temperature climate, it works great. It allows me to work on the garage when I couldn't before.|Positive
"This works better than AC, because I get to stay cool all the time. I turn it on in April and run it until October in California. It will normally drop the temperature 20-30 degrees according to my Samsung. With AC it's too expensive so I used to only use it in June and July conservatively. Now I get to be comfy so much longer on those hot and warm days. The ""scorching"" days of 108+, it works pretty good still, cooling down to about 75-80 if it's dry out in all rooms. I'd still recommend a window AC or whole house AC to compliment it, for the days where it's too humid in the summer, I got about 15 of those days in the Central Valley last year where I still used AC and a week in Socal. On the $ side of things, I do not even see the cooler on my electric or water bill! And I have it running almost 24/7 for 5 months, I've had this item for 2 years now and it's the best purchase I've ever made. Water cooler did go out on it, I replaced with a much heavier duty one from Amazon. It is normal for water coolers to go out on swamps though, kind of like expected maintenance on a car. I've had the original pads in the whole time with no issue, with high mineral water. RECOMMEND: Putting a bottle of vinegar in the water every two weeks, it will get rid of any bacteria/smells. Clean once a month with a tough sponge to get rid of mineral build up."|Positive
well packaged. no real assembly necessary. in no time my orchids were saying ahhhh!|Positive
This is my second one. The first one my only complaint is the oscillating feature broke after a few months We use this to increase humidity in our orchid greenhouse. It works well as it is an enclosed space. I know for Home use you would leave it near a ventilated area but for the purpose we use it for we need to increase humidity. It brings up humidity about 30 percent It is very hot and dry in summer so this helps a lot.|Positive
Piece of junk. Does not work. I even dipped the filter in water and stuck it in the freezer for an hour. Still did not work. I would remove from your store. I would give it 0 stars if I could. BUYER BEWARE.HD Customer Service was great though with the return.|Negative
Love it!!!!! Keeps us cool in this California HEAT!!!|Positive
The air it blowed wasn’t cool at all. I understand it isn’t an air conditioner, but it made the room hotter. Regret making this purchase.|Negative
I was surprised to find out that this item is actually not programmable at all. This is simply another digital cooler thermostat. Save your money and by the Dial digital thermostat for around $40 that does the same thing.|Negative
very good design works well quiet good air flow great price|Positive
I went down to Home Depot to pick it up, nobody checked it out, I got it home and found out that it was Damaged, so Had to make the trip back to Missoula again, NOT A HAPPY CAMPER. I just got a Refund.|Negative
In my opinion this unit is too noisy. That is my only complain. It cannot be set in a bedroom because the noise is too high. The cool level is OK. I was not expecting it to perform like an AC, but I think it does OK. With regards to the features, I already knew there is no sleep mode, timer, etc. But it would be nice for the manufacturer to think on adding those features in their next product's version.|Negative
Working very well so far....I'm using it indoors and as long as I keep enough windows open it keeps the upstairs of my house nice and cool!It gets very humid if you only leave one window open. A floor fan in the bedroom doorways helps pull the cold into them.So far, so good!|Positive
Warning: Replacement fan motors are hard to find. No off-the-shelf motors.|Negative
It does the job! Perfect size for a average size bedroom. Easy to use and set up.|Positive
We live in AZ so we are trying to cut down on the cooling cost. This fan is great to keep air circulating. We sleep with fan going and I use to have nose bleeds or wakeup with my nose having problems. Since we have had this fan I haven't had those problems. I would recommend this fan to those who want more out of a fan than just air circulation. I plan to buy another for upstairs.|Positive
Does not work as it says.|Negative
Had no idea this was an option until it showed up later in the feed. But what a great addition, makes it so easy to close up for winter and cooler summer nights..|Positive
Just what I ordered.|Positive
Box had no manual. And no manual online. Remote did not work. Unit leaked water. I couldnt return it fast enough. Poor quality|Negative
Very good for our house; we may buy another one to cover our entire house 1400 sq ft. Problem is only filling the water tank, as we move from livingroom to our bedroom. High Desert CA with very low humidity..|Positive
This will do what I need it to. Side panels are not ridged and tend to be twisted making them difficult to insert.|Positive
The fan on this is great doesn't take up much space great. The cooling aspect is bad, but great fan|Positive
The price was just right but for my building I needed another one but could not get the sale price anymore .|Positive
I use this for my Florida room it is sunny in there because I have alot of plants it is better than solely ceiling fans. It would better to have a air conditioning unit be there is not anyway to put one in. I use ice to make it cooler.|Positive
Easy to install working well|Positive
I purchased 2 units and both were defective. One had the power board die within one week of purchase. The other was broken right out of the box - the pump wouldn't pull water and it was basically an overpriced fan that would beep error messages because the pump didn't work.|Negative
It out performs the original Unit it came with nice and cool on my master cool mmb14|Positive
rcomend to others|Positive
I live in Colorado and bought this 5 years ago in lieu of installing A/C. It works fantastic and does not affect my utility bill at all (unlike A/C). The MasterCool has been an awesome product and is still going strong! If a pump should need to be replaced, it is an inexpensive and easy swap. I have only had to replace one so far. Will be replacing the media this season, but again...cheap and easy! I recommend purchasing the exterior cover, as this keeps debris out of the media in the off season. Love this thing!|Positive
This is really a sturdy, well made unit. We live in the high desert in CA and have outdoor pets. Excellent, even in 110 degree outdoor temps. Although described a two speed unit, it has three speeds...even better. We hooked up to an outdoor hose, and have had no issues. Recommend|Positive
When this evaporative cooler arrived we were a bit skeptical of how effectively it would cool compared to a window a/c or floor to window a/c unit. At half the price of what we had been looking into in the a/c range we simply didn't know what to expect. After reading many reviews we were convinced the dry inland Southern California temperatures would be a great test for an evaporative cooling solution. We also liked that this particular unit seemed as though it would be much lighter than a/c units, by comparison, and had a tall slender footprint for output and wide aerial cooling. There was less than 60 seconds of 'assembly' out of the box- honestly, reading the instructions and warnings took longer. I was really happy with how simple the filling process was for the tank, and how easy the unit was to situate in many areas of the room. We first tried the oscillating fan function, and were very impressed with how QUIET the fan function was. There was a decent amount of immediate air flow and we could easily sense the breeze from this unit even 15 feet away on a couch. Oh High the fan function is quite powerful and offers a good range of height in wind distribution thanks to the tower style. Now the manufacturer suggests optimal cooling of up to 250 sq ft, but we initially used this in a living room space with high ceilings, considerably larger. The evap cooling function worked effectively on a dry heat day of 83F, but worked most similar to an air conditioner would in our master bedroom, which is closer to 250 sq ft. In my opinions the dryer and hotter it is the bigger your impact will be. 75F to 80F external temp seems to be the sweet spot for that 'ahhh' room cooling with this evap cooler. We love the remote function, and in general this is just a very convenient and effective way to cool off efficiently for people who are primarily inhabiting a single room at a time and want to temperature control their environment.|Positive
Growing up in West Texas, I know how good swamp coolers are, I never thought someone could come up with a portable one that works so well. The air purifier is an added bonus that has all my friends envious!|Positive
Solved our problem with our cooler , works great for our application. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to balance their room|Positive
When Home Depot says expedited shipping they sure mean it. My unit arrived less than 2 business days after I ordered it! The deal was too good to pass on. I highly recommend this unit for outdoor use; not sure about indoor. We have a good size patio area and this unit definitely cools it well. The first day it arrived it was 105 degrees and the next 2 days were 107 so it got broken in fast. Very pleased with this purchase.|Positive
With our low humidity (10 percent) it goes through its water reservoir quickly.|Positive
"We got this cooler to replace our portable A/C unit. We have an 1100 sq.ft. house and the old unit was only rated for 400 sq.ft. This unit is rated at 1600 sq.ft., but looking at the region chart they provide it looks like it's probably more like 1200 - 1300 sq.ft. for our region. Needless to say, the days of the family hanging out in our underwear in the living room with the A/C are over! This unit is more than adequate. Installation was a piece of cake. The installation instructions say that the window opening needs to be at least 22"". My window opening was only 21.5"", so I was assuming I was going to need to remove the sliding part of the window (our windows slide open right-to-left), but I was able to fit the unit through the window just fine. I actually had to slide the window closed about 1"". I think the 22"" is for the actual grill of the unit, which is wider than the tunnel (I guess that's what you would call it) where the fan is. It does stick out into the room a bit further than it probably needs to. There's plenty of room for the fan if the tunnel were to be a little shorter, but they are probably trying to make sure it will fit in all types of window openings. The only think I didn't like was that there is a drain line that you need to run out the overflow in order to make sure that the unit is continually getting fresh water. You need to do this because as the water evaporates, it leaves behind all the minerals and that will gum up the unit over time. This drain dumps A LOT of water. I had a 5gal bucket sitting under the unit and had to empty it at least once an hour when the pump was running. They sell a ""purge pump"" kit so that it will dump & refill the water once every 6 hours, which means using about 2.5 gal ever 6 hours instead of 5gal every hour. Don't waste your money on that kit. It costs $60 and really all it is is a $20 sump pump from the hardware store and a piece of tubing. I also read reviews that said the purge pump only came on if the unit were running for 6 hours *continually*. Turning it off reset the timer, so you could potentially NEVER have it turn on. I skipped the pump business all together and instead bough a separate ""evaporative cooler overflow drain"" kit from the hardware store for $5 and a $5 garden hose on/off valve and drilled a new hole and installed it next to the existing overflow valve (I cut the new overflow valve so it would be as close to flush with the bottom of the reservoir). Now, once a day in the evening, I manually drain all the water into a bucket and dump it in the lawn. Now, instead of 1 gal every hour, I only use 2.5 - 3 gal each day."|Positive
Easy to install, packaging a little damaged in shipping and thus product but still working well. Be prepared to have bad smell at first drain water and better|Positive
Perfect fit and extremely high quality|Positive
I purchased the 470 CFM 4-speed portable evaporative cooler to cool an upstairs room which becomes extremely hot during the summer months and find it to perform excellently cooling the room to be comfortable. I live in an arid area consequently it is perfect.|Positive
"The fan works great, but you have to be sitting directly in front of it when ""cool"" is on (water pump to cool the air) to feel the air flow."|Positive
Very quiet unit. Easy to move around and cools very well. I'm using it during the Texas summer in an open garage man cave. Works great.|Positive
This motor is a piece of crap. High speed and low speed are intermittent and even on high it runs high intermittently and reverts to low. I'm bringing it back for a refund.|Negative
I just replaced 2 champion swamp coolers that I've had for 10 and 15 years. They simply rusted away which was expected. I always recommended champion swamp coolers to everyone. Both of the new units have very poor pumps in them and I'm very disapointed. If it were not such a huge amount of work to remove them, I would return them. I pulled the pumps out of the old ones to get my unit working again, but I realy would like to make my feelings known because I cannot find any place to complain to. So, you may want to upgrade the pump right off, because otherwise you will be blowing hot air and wasting your money.|Negative
Works good for a bedroom. Works best with cold water and ice. Really loud , can't hear the TV at all.|Positive
The cooler did not work|Negative
The vent cover does exactly what it is manufactured to do, dIrect the airflow of the swamp cooler.|Negative
Pillow fit snugly. Easy to install would buy again.|Positive
The products are made out of good material and easy to put on. I wish they had a plastic locking piece on there that you could just pull the drawstrings with instead of having to tie them.|Positive
If you are buying a swamp cooler, you already know that they only work with low humidity. That aside, Champion Coolers have been making this same cooler for decades, and they always self destruct after a reasonable service life. Rust is their enemy. Why not use a plastic pan that won't rust out and require tarring every season? Can't you make the water gutters that wet the pads out of something that wont rust out? (think stainless steel or fiberglass/pvc). The squirrel cage housing could also use better rust protection.|Positive
This unit works beautifully in the high mountain desert of New Mexico! In New Mexico there are several weeks each year when the humidity is very low, the temperatures in the 90s and the evaporative cooling effect this unit unit provides for half of our home (about 800 square feet) keeps us cool!|Positive
Loving it! It does exactly what we hoped it would do. It's compact so it's easily moved from room to room and cools extremely well, even on low.|Positive
Tank you for having the parts needed to complete this job .|Positive
excellent|Positive
No comment .......................................................|Negative
I had to cut the pad for the correct size since Homedepot didn’t carry the replacement pad for the cooler I purchase last summer from their store.|Positive
We live at slightly over 7,000 feet and have been using a similar evaporative cooler in our master bedroom since 1999 (still works). While shopping at Home Depot today we found this cooler on sale for $318 (was originally advertised for $354). Our living room faces to the west so it gets very warm in the late afternoon (around 83F). We built a stand for this cooler and placed it in the kitchen window without any problems. Everything you need for installation is included except the copper water tubing and faucet/valve. Even though the cooler comes with two (2) wall chains we have learned over the years to build your own cooler stand in addition to using the support chains. This provides a more stable platform for the cooler. After about 3 hours of building the stand, installing the cooler and closing up open gaps we have a very nice cooling system on the west side of our house. Works great! As I am writing this at 1630 hours, the living room temperature is a cool 73F and dropping. Note: because of our highly alkaline well water we have found that using a zinc anode and water conditioner blocks really helps. We highly recommend Champion products and this evaporative cooler.|Positive
Works great , and quiet for its size. Tray drain isn't the best, but works. Water level not accurate. When showing half full, it is out of water. Very satisfied using in the house or on the patio. (100 plus weather) Customer complaints started out good, but They dropped me before problem resolved.|Positive
Perfect fit and arrived in good amount of time|Positive
Modern and sleek!|Positive
These pads were too thin. I had to put two pads per cooler panel to make them thick enough.|Negative
I ranked this Luma 500 CFM Evaporative cooler poor due to its poor cooling ability. If you are trying to get some kind of relief from 85 to 110 degree heat then my suggestion is do not buy this unit. Buy a portable A/C unit. If you are looking for a good fan that has some good features, can blow a lot of air and looks nice then this may be the unit for you . The cooling feature of this unit is whats not good. Even when you put ice water, the ice packs provided and ice cubes in the water tray it still only barely blows semi cool air in high temps and it is not cold enough to cool 85 to 110 degree temps. If you keep your windows closed during the day while high temps are being reached and then turn it on the unit creates a lot of humidity and mugginess in the house while barely cooling at all, so you end up having to open a window to try and get the humidity out while letting in hot air at the same time.|Negative
I followed clear directions. Dropped the temp. 15 degrees in my sunroom.|Positive
Excellent. Friends are now interested in getting one of these coolers...because they work!|Positive
Not too bad|Negative
Since I put them on, we can feel the difference inside the house a good product.|Positive
Original Equipment pads from Bonaire. Came with new installation hardware , but was missing one tab at arrival. I just reused an old clip and they fit perfect. Just happened to be cheaper through Home Depot with free shipping.|Positive
I use it while working in 4 car garage and it does the job well. The top is a working shelf. Really moves the cool air and more sturdy than others in this price range. Takes up the same amount of space as less cfm evap coolers but does twice the job. Ambient temp 88, air from cooler was 75. Nice...|Positive
Compact and nice design. Just one thing to remember: evaporative cooling (this one) works ONLY on dry climates.|Positive
Works as advertised. Happy with the choice|Positive
great capacity and powerful fan|Positive
These are very flimsy when wet. I wound up ordering the correct pads from a cooler supply company for about double the cost.|Negative
A great fix for swamp cooler valve.|Positive
There is no parts list in case something breaks. Very poor for a expensive unit|Negative
Spent twice as much buying a porta cool 130 then heard about this one and ordered it and it works way better for half the price|Positive
Very nice unit for the money. Excellent warranty. Easy to take apart to service and install.|Positive
Where I live we dont usually get over 100 degrees, but with this heat wave I am staying cool and comfortable! I have it in my living room. I leave in on for 12 hours a day and I'm sure it could go longer but I have not needed it to stay on late because we cool down outside around 7pm. I fill the top with ice and I add ice cold water to the Tank. I dont fill it too much so that I can add More COLD water as the day goes on. I love this cooler because it has wheels and I can roll it around the house and it turns easily. it has many options for speed, humidify or just cool air and also a timer if you choose to use it. I would highly recommend this product. It's an excellent value to comfort and staying cool.|Positive
The cooler arrived and was placed into service despite limited, incomplete instructions. Those in their technical support service admittedly know nothing about the product and how it operates. I have yet to figure out how to install the frozen ice pack bottles into the water tank. They, when frozen, are misshaped at the top and probably won't fit into allotted spaces. Tech support person told me just to place them into the water tank cavity. I question this as I am concerned the frozen ice pack (s) will cause the pump to malfunction. The first tech support person that I asked questions of placed me on hold and didn't return. I placed a second call to receive the information that I am reporting in this commentary. This would be a very good product for its intended purposes if the aforementioned problems were to be corrected. Thank you.|Negative
Easy to install. Replaces old-style controller.|Positive
Location Colorado This works well in our 20x15 upstairs bedroom. Low speed is quiet for this type of unit. Med is reasonable. HI is noisy and will make you turn the TV up quite a bit. No need for hi really tho. Water capacity is good. Suggest using the timer if you sleep too long the beep will not wake you up and you don't want to damage the pump. I recommend for medium sized rooms for large areas go with the Honeywell 525 or similar.|Positive
My $20 fan cools as much or better as this (swamp cooler) even when ice is placed in it. I|Negative
Bought three of these units a few weeks ago during a heat wave. When I received the units I assembled them and quickly filled them with water. 2 just dripped, 1 really leaked all over my hard wood floors thank you very much. You can tighten them, but they are made of plastic and run out of threads before they tighten enough. I am in the process of taking each one apart a glue/sealing them. I hope it works. Would NOT recommend this item. And if you do buy one I suggest that you try filling it first with the unit in a place where water leaking all over is not a problem. BAD drain plug design.|Negative
Unit has done everything mfr claimed it could do.|Positive
Awesome Fan!!! Going to purchase another to help with this Texas heat!!|Positive
"Despite the warnings that this unit does not work well in humidity, I tried it anyway. The rumors are true. It does not work to cool air at any level. Further, after five uses it has begun to turn off with a no water"" ndicator even though the water container is at least half full. I am returning it."|Negative
It's a cooler pump, installed the pump turned it on and it pumped water.|Positive
This cover is being used as winter protection for our air conditioner. The size is perfect. Keep in mind that it is a bit larger than the advertised size to compensate for shrinkage over time. The material is a heavy waxed canvas type and there is a draw string at the bottom. The draw string is a bit difficult to pull tight but that is due to the heavy nature of the canvas. I ended up using bungee cords to secure the cover. The only negative. and the reason for 4 stars, was that a yellow dust residue came off the cover onto my clothes when I was installing it. Because of the waterproofing used on the cover this dust was difficult to brush off. Other than that this is a great value and the online order process from Home Depot was flawless as usual.|Positive
Out of the blue my original cooler pump just quit, so I was THRILLED that my homer still had cooler parts still available. This was very easy to install and it worked perfectly!|Positive
First let me explain my situation... My wife and I bought our first home last year... it's an older home and we don't have central AC... all we have is a window unit on the main level that cools down the living room nicely but it came with the house and we have no idea the lifespan of it. Our house is a tri-level old style... the upstairs is just 6 stairs going up... bathroom straight ahead... room to the left and a room to the right. The rooms are not too big but in the summer as soon as you hit that landing at the top of the stairs... the wall of heat hits you like a ton of bricks. We're talking nearly 90 degrees in the room where I keep my computer. Last year I used a simple 5,000 btu window unit that I borrowed from a friend as a temporary solution. I was going back and forth researching Portable Evaporative Cooler's...reading every review price matching...trying to find something that would cool down the entire upstairs of our home. This cooler went on sale last week which brought it down to $279... that's a steal for a 3100 CFM machine so I pulled the trigger. First off... yes it's a honker... it takes up an entire doorway but thank God you can roll it around. It isn't too heavy when it's empty... I kinda wish it had a handle on the side at the top to carry it up stairs but that's no big deal. I ended up grabbing a faucet adapter for the bathroom upstairs and hooking up a small hose to fill the machine (works well) at first I hooked it up to the supply valve on the side of the unit and it works fine but... it's a hose...in the hallway... and with the machine plugged in to the wall outlet it's a little difficult to move at that point. So I've settled with just hooking up the hose and filling the machine at the front. Five minutes or so and the tank is 100% full. Now I live in Colorado and yesterday was about 84 degrees with 12% humidity outside. I opened the small window in the bathroom turned the machine to the right to cool down my office with the computer (which was nearly 80 degrees) cracked open the window at the back of the room... and with in about say 30 minutes or so the room was 71.5 degrees. I held a thermostat directly in front of the fan and it was blowing out air that was about 68 degrees. It definitely puts out cold air. It is quite loud... on low it sounds like a box fan on high. On Medium or High it's a freaking jet engine lol. ... as people have stated it does have a slight odor at first but It goes away after consistent use. I started with a full tank and left it running...after about 5 hours of running on Low I still had about a half tank full of water. On super hot and dry days I would imagine I would have to fill it every 4 hours at least... but on a day like yesterday it could probably run for at least 10 hours on low before having to be filled again. I'm still testing this thing out in different areas upstairs but the best part? I can point it straight ahead to the living room from the top of the stairs and it is capable of cooling down our entire living room which is about 750 sq ft. Went from 76 to about 70 yesterday in about 30 minutes...on low. So we don't always have to run that Window AC 24/7 in the summer now. The high today is 90 with humidity at 10%... perfect Summer type of day to test this thing out some more. All in all I am impressed with this cooler and I'm looking forward to using it this Summer. If you live in a hot dry climate and are looking for an alternative to a window AC or just don't want to run your central AC 24/7. Pick one of these up.|Positive
The Hessaire Portable Evaporative Cooler is a breath of cool air for the Patrons of the 7th Street Food Pantry in Phoenix, AZ. They line up at the back of the building waiting to receive Food Boxes. It is VERY HOT here in Phoenix and before I purchased this Cooler everyone were very miserable. I run it on HI Speed with the Swing Feature turned on. When the air is dry, I hook up the water hose to produce refreshing cool air for everyone. During humid days, I just run the Fan. Yes, on HI Speed the Fan puts out enough CFMs to reach the back of the line. Everyone loves it and have thanked me many times for getting this. I've been using this for a couple of months during dry weather and humid weather and this has more than met my expectations and has especially met the expectations of the Patrons.|Positive
"New unit has slightly larger pads, 2"" in height, otherwise it is fine. It replaces a previous 10 year old cool tool used to in my garage."|Positive
Works very well in hot weather, 90 - 95. Really like this product.|Positive
This cover fit perfectly. It is heavy duty canvas very well made. It was so easy to install, took about 10 minutes. I would recommend this to everyone! It will protect your evaporation cooler from the elements.|Positive
Was not real familiar with coolers, this is much larger than I anticipated and didn't realize it had to be placed in front of an open door or window. It does work well and rolls easily to move around just takes up quite a bit of space|Positive
Didn’t make a difference in my room. I even tried it with ice and the temperature still stayed the same. I would not recommend this product to anyone.|Negative
This product only works if it is under 90 degrees. This product is like a cheap fan that makes the house more humid.|Negative
THIS IS MY 3 RD ONE IN QUITE A FEW YEARS. THEY LAST AND FIT PERFECT.|Positive
Requires 2 people for easy install. The house is less drafty with the cover. The neutral color is great (I see a lot of those bright yellow canvas ones around, kinda ugly right?)|Positive
I purchased for my large familyroom. But I needed more area coverage. I moved to bedroom and it's perfect.|Positive
Cover fits snug which is great for our high wind area. Easy to put on and looks great.|Positive
"There are a number of issues with the Swamp Cooler itself: 1) The big Squirrel Cage Fan, pushes plenty of air, but on this setup, the 2-speed motor when on LOW, the Fan bearings issue a sound like ""whoomp-whoomp-whoomp"" on about a 1 ~ 2 second cycle. It is very irritating. The swamp cooler is mounted on the roof, in the exact same place the previous one was, which did NOT make this sound. I am very mechanically inclined, from my experience the BEARINGS on the SHAFT of the Squirrel Cage Fan assembly, are either defective, or the whole cage/fan assembly is so unbalanced that it causes the load on the bearings to load-up and unload, causing this sound. I removed the fan belt from the motor, and the motor is completely QUIET, so that's not it. The only thing left, is either the bearings on the shaft of the squirrel cage assembly, or the very large pulley is out of round and causes extra tension on the fan belt as it goes around. I've loosened and tightened the fan belt which does not help. 2) The unit is built from substantially lighter weight sheet metal, as well as very cheap construction. The screws which are in almost constant contact with both mist, spray and actual water both in the bottom tray area and also the 4 corner posts (not welded or bolted rather just cheap screws without any real lasting protective coating) are kinda a joke, as it's poorly built."|Negative
"The ""1/4 in. Evaporative Cooler Bronze Float Valve"" was an EXACT match for the original one. When I went to Home Depot an employee took me right to the bin and handed it to me. The employees are always ready and willing to help."|Positive
Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to install and fits perfectly.|Positive
I will first say I ordered this online and had delivered to store for pick-up. The process was super easy and the cooler arrived quickly. 5 stars for the process! My first unit had a pump defect, exchanged for a new one and it is AMAZING! Keeps my entire patio cool! Great in greenhouse/garage.|Positive
It never did cool off the air. By the second night it started making a bad noise in the fan. I have returned it|Negative
Great improvement by Evapolar. Happy to be a project backer once again.|Positive
It did not cool the area|Negative
Seems to be a well made product|Positive
The media is exactly the replacement I needed to keep my evaporative cooler running at optimum performance.|Positive
fits like it is supposed to, easy to install|Positive
This cooler and accessories were purchased for next years hot season----it has not been used yet. Assembled yes.|Positive
Worked good, I like the ease of filling by removing the reservoir, was hard to get out since it was partly restricted by the tubing. Did not cool as much as the other larger coolers with full size fans.|Positive
Good fit and material|Positive
Bought this after 3 people at our automotive shop purchased Port-a-Cool Cyclone 2200s. After taking a chance of purchasing this online without seeing it, I have been very impressed. I use it in a closed shop with vent system for vehicle fumes and 2 Big As* Fans (plenty of ventilation for excess hyumidity) I cool only directly in front of it (it does not cool the whole shop). The ambient temp was 91 and it was putting out 76. Very happy with this. Makes for a happier more productive technician! Can't beat the price vs competition!! One of the guys is returning the Port-a-Cool for one of these. The Hessaire works best for our application.|Positive
Nice heavy cover, should last for years.|Positive
It worked well for a small space and made a difference this summer when it was very hot in Reno.|Positive
This cooler is awesome.easy to install.Cools down my whole 3 bd house on setting 1.Buy one today!you will not be disappointed.|Positive
Champion coolers are very efficient and I expect the two I purchased to give good service and last a long time. With reasonable maintenance I don't think I will be disappointed.|Positive
It's feels great sitting right in front of it. Other than that it didn't work well in 10x12 room. Go bigger or go ac|Negative
This is a great air conditioner, it works very well. The air is very cool and it's very quiet. It won't get rusty like the regular swamp cooler either. I highly recommend it worth the extra money. Sincerely the Rocketman.|Positive
Does cool, but creates a lot of humidity.|Positive
I needed a non-standard cover for a garden cart and the material and dimensions in the description looked like a good fit. The package was delivered promptly and the cover is what I wanted. Will see in the spring how it holds up to winter weather.|Positive
We use it to cool room we are in and cool air extends to other parts of house. Use my whole house ac less because this works so well. Dont expect it to cool as much as an air conditioner.|Positive
Very sturdy and easy to install. Works well.|Positive
coveer is heavy duty and fits well with good tie down|Positive
It is working better then I expected. I did have to go inside it to hook up the water line but it was no big deal.|Positive
Having adjusted for all the conditions, nuances and specifications, it does not work. There is room ventilation, there is low humidity outside, there are clean filters, cooling mat is appropriately wet and cool to touch, but the unit blows warm air. Putting ice in the water helps a little, but if the room temp is too high, the unit does not blow cooling air. If the room temp is lower, and it is cooling outside such as in the evening, the unit works okay - blows cool air.|Negative
Worked well for our pop-up camper. Don't expect this to work when humidity or dewpoint is above levels recommended for evaporative cooling. Great value and easy to handle even with water in it. There is a hose connection and float valve, although I did not see this in the online description. Once we add A/C to the camper, this will be used in our garage to keep me cool as I work on things out there.|Positive
It worked great for 2 months then it blew up, literally popped, electrical short of some sort and it was loud enough to wake us up in the middle of the night.. I probably got a bad unit but I'm returning it for something else.|Positive
It was good|Positive
Just works great!|Positive
Best one I could find for the Price. Overall this is a quality built canvas cover. The fit is good (was unable to find my exact size) the tie rope could be better and maybe put a couple of loops on the bottom and on the opening to keep it closed better during windy conditions.|Positive
The evaporative cooler works well. Its been a life saver on real hot days. It has a lot of power|Positive
"The device has 3 speeds, not four. Like most fans, there is no true ""low"" or even medium setting. They should be labelled HIGH, TOO HIGH and HURRICANE. Aside from that annoying issue, the Honeywell 300 CFM is a great product. I am wondering about installing a resister to achieve a true low setting, however."|Positive
Like it a lot. Great for tiny room. Use often. Only downside is you have to put ice all the time|Negative
Received this works great except in the desert the tap water is not cool. Froze plastic dishes with ice and added to water. It really cooled the patio however a second one is being ordered since the patio is 12 x 15 and 10 foot ceiling and it is not entirely enclosed.|Positive
I just received this unit on 8/31/18. It seems to work ok, but I was disappointed as the top of the unit was dented and pushed in a little and the packaging cardboard protective cover on top of the unit showed signs of something being stacked on top of it which probably pushed in the top. I haven't installed it yet but we will see how it runs.|Negative
Made from good durable material. Fits nice, easy to put on. I did make one small modification by adding a round hole on the bottom of the cover to clear the drain. It makes it fit and stay on much better by adding the hole. I glued a leather ring around the hole to prevent it from tearing and becoming a larger hole. Excellent product, highly recommend it.|Positive
Wasnt nearly as effective as I thought it would be|Negative
"Do not buy this product you will regret !! From missing parts to never do the job. This ""cooler"" makes a small room 10x10 even hotter !!! You have to refill the water level every hour or so, the high speed makes a lots of noise so you will not be able to sleep and doesn't work !! It's a dripping water machine and never cools even small rooms. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL !! Did I mention AWFUL ?? It is AWFUL !!!!!! Waste of time, energy and money."|Negative
Arrived extremely quickly (three days!) well in advance of the estimated delivery date. Boxed up nicely, no shipping damage noted. Removed it, installed casters, filled with water and plugged it in and hit the fan/pump combo. Fan comes on but no pump. Took off back, nothing obviously wrong other than pump not working. So now I have a very expensive fan. Before boxing it back up, decided to pop out the control panel (easy) and immediately noticed a disconnected wire. Disconnected because it was never crimped properly (forget solder which would actually prevent this type of failure). Once the wiring was fixed, it all worked and worked quite well. Now I've gone back in and soldered all those joints which should have been done at the factory. Most people would have returned the unit to their store and either canceled the order or waited for another one which hopefully would work properly. As an evaporative cooler, it works quite well if you use it properly (dry climate, lots of airflow to and from unit). If you're using hard water in this unit (like me), you'll probably be buying replacements pumps every few years.|Negative
I just replaced a very old master cool with this unit.. They are the best. Quite, build to last, great air flow, and flow really helps me keep control of the electric bill.|Positive
works as advertised..good|Positive
I pretty much found the perfect gift for my 15 year old son. My son gets horrible bloody noses every Fall/Winter from the dry air and he hates to sleep at night without a fan on so this is a HUGE win/win for us!! We have had this in his room for a few weeks as just the fan but over the past week have filled it with water since the air is so dry. I love this because it has a 5 gallon tank unlike the tiny humidifier we had been using over the years. I highly recommend this for you home or office!|Positive
BOUGHT THIS OVERSIZE UNIT TO COOL ABOUT A THIRD OF ITS RATED CAPACITY AND IT DOES THAT JOB VERY WELL.........UNIT ARRIVED WITH A DEFECTIVE FLOAT VALVE RESULTING IN THE UNIT OVER FLOWING........NEW VALVE SENT PROMPTLY AND THE UNIT WORKS AS ADVERTISED.|Positive
The swamp cooler works just fine and for the price I find it satisfactory. The only concern I have and this was for the two I have installed this year is both times the motor mounts were bent in shipping. Also when you go to pop out the hole for power it is very difficult.|Positive
It's very noisy, and as one customer already posted, all it does is add moisture to the air. It definitely made the room more humid. If you sit or stand in front of the cooler, then you can feel the coolness, the same as you would with just a fan, but it's not effective in cooling a room. I even put ice in the well and although the ice melted quickly, it didn't make the room any cooler. The water runs over the ice, melting it and making cooler water, but it doesn't make the air coming from the fan noticeably cooler. I'm returning it and am going to use what I've been using: a big bowl of ice in front of my table fan. It works a lot better and is much quieter.|Negative
Excellent cooling capacity for the area installed. Nice looking unit that doesn't protrude to far outside the window.|Positive
Worked as it should.|Positive
I would give it 10 stars if I could|Positive
Don't throw your money away! This machine is terrible! It does not cool at all! It's like sitting in front of a fan with a water bottle and spritzing the air so it blows back on you. All it does is cause humidity!|Negative
Gteat love it would recommend to anyone|Positive
Fairly quiet and better value then other models.will update in a few months on reliability|Positive
Home Depot needs to stock parts for items they sell. Instead they want to sell you cheaper aftermarket parts that burn up quickly! Electrical connections don't match making installation more difficult! Apparently Home Depot values a quick buck over customer loyalty!|Negative
Fit very well and is very well made!And Would recommend it to others.|Positive
Good replacement for my master cooler original pump|Positive
The cooler is working well so far, we have been using it about 3 weeks. We have a 2800 SF ranch and it is difficult to cool on days in the upper 80s and above. This cooler is much more powerful than the previous one which we used for 20 years. I would definitely recommend this cooler.|Positive
There is very little airflow temp is not cold it was worthless to me I returned it It is also way over priced even if it did work well I was highly disappointed as I loved the design|Negative
I love the design and they are very lightweight which is good for me. Unfortunately our weather has been very humid lately and they seemed to struggle with cooling. I realize the humidity makes a difference in performance so I think they did the best they could.|Positive
This cooler pump make my summer very cool I recommend this product who ever need a cooler pump Thank you The home depot|Positive
Great swamp cooler, just replaced the same basic model from 15 years ago. Easy to install.|Positive
This is a replacement for a pump that had been working well until the calcium deposits clocked up the whole system. The moment we installed this pump, there was a dramatic difference in the cooling. We actually have to turn it off at night because it makes our house too cold.|Positive
The fit was perfect. There was a smell for awhile, we just drained the water a few times and it went away. Good product.|Positive
The beeping when it runs out of air can be obnoxious. Saying that it can cool any room and it's easy to clean the fliter is easy and it's good just to put in a corner and forget about it|Positive
Stopped working after a week and a half....will be pulling it out and returning it today....don't know if it was defective from the start, or couldn't handle the California heat we're having...|Negative
This was purchased for me as a gift for my brooder house. I live in a very dry climate, northeastern Nevada and this swamp cooler had done a splendid job of keeping the temps down. At least a 8-10° drop from outside. I would hesitate to use it indoors only because it's bulky and needs to pull in very dry air to work properly. I would recommend this as a enclosed patio or shop cooler.|Positive
as expected|Negative
It's loud and does not cool it as much as I thought it would.|Negative
Worked fine. A little awkward to use.|Positive
We recently moved to another house which has an evaporative cooler. I knew I had to cover it before winter and in fear and trembling went to Home Depot for a good canvass cover. The clerk was very helpful in finding the right thing and also found the simple straps to secure the cover in any wind. I brought it home, got on the roof and in a matter of a few minutes the cover went on and I secured it with the ratchet straps the clerk recommended! Great products. Thank you.|Positive
Covers were easy to install and secure. Appear to be of good quality, but time will tell.|Positive
Received in a timely manner, product was as described, works great. Very pleased.|Positive
Good price, works good|Positive
I am on a limited budget and my husband needs a cool house. This swamp cooler met all of our needs. I would recommend this product.|Positive
This evaporative cooler held promise but this particular sample malfunctioned. It was an adequate fan but the evaporative part failed by spitting forward a great deal of water and making a rattling sound, as if something was hitting the fan that should not have been doing so. I returned and bought a simple fan (made in the USA). It works. Thanks, Home Depot, for making the returns process absolutely simple and blame-free. I am still a loyal shopper.|Negative
Last year 6-15-12 I bought the master cool model ADA51. Had it installed by a licensed contractor, this year April 2013 went to start it up for spring, and discovered the wheel on the blower had come apart and was making a terrible noise. Essick Air, was quickly responsive to my request for warranty for the defective part, requiring submittal of documentation of the problem, and proof of purchase. I had excellent documentation thanks to my contractor; however the labor to replace the defective part was not covered under their warranty and I had to pay to have the defective part replaced. The cooler was purchased for my parents who are in their late 70’s, we selected the Master Cool because we thought it was a quality item and would only need routine maintenance for some years. However we incurred a substantial repair bill replacing the poorly welded squirrel cage not even 1 year after purchase needless to say I was highly disappointed and clearly made an error in assuming Master Cool was quality well made product.|Negative
This cooler failed to turn on after 4 weeks in operation. I have since replaced this very poorly built unit.|Negative
I ordered a set of these 29 inch x 21 inch aspen pads (product number 05-002-0218), had them delivered to my local Home Depot and picked them up today. To be clear, ordered 1 unit, or box, at the cost of about $25, and I received a set of three pads in that box. These are for my Brisa BW4000 evaporative air cooler, or swamp cooler. This is my first season servicing a swamp cooler, so I expected the dimensions of the aspen pads to be the actual size of my grille panels, which is 29 inches x 21 inches. The actual dimensions of each individual aspen pad, which I measured with my tape measure, were 23 inches by 30 inches, which surprised me a little at first, but they did scrunch into each grille panel and seem to be working nicely. The product description describes the thickness of these as two inches. But they are actually about 7/8 inches thick per pad. Perhaps when moist they expand to two inches, but when new and dry, they are close to one inch thick. I ordered these on a Saturday night and received an email saying they were ready for pickup at the store around 4pm the following Wednesday, which I was I thought was a pretty fast shipment.|Positive
This motor work so good that you cannot feel any heat from cooking while the motor is on. Thank you. M.MUNN|Positive
I have bought Brians cooler covers In the past and found them to be good quality and durable. However, I get a discount on another brand of covers so for the past couple of years I have been buying that brand instead. When I needed cooler covers this year, I discovered that the other brand have stopped making the canvas covers and switched to plastic - and made in China. I do what I can to buy USA, so returned to Brian's for good value, a good fit, and helping to keep the USA economy going!!|Positive
I was pleasantly surprised when this pump arrived. It is well made and works better than what I had in the cooler when I installed the cooler.|Positive
The cooler feature isn’t the best. It’s an expensive fan.|Negative
This product was easy to put together. That was the only thing good about it! The fan doesn't blow very good and it barely blew cold air out of it. The air wasn't even that cold. It uses a lot of water. If you don't get good ventilation in the room, it will make your room muggy. I was very disappointed. It is not worth $200. There were 7 good reviews and 13 bad reviews when I bought this. I should have went with my gut and not bought it.|Negative
My parents had these in their house for over 40 years with great success. Their house would be 73 degrees while it's in the 90s outside. I just installed 5 in my home. Installation was fine, be sure to get in the attic to avoid wiring. Now the house is 10 degrees cooler, and much safer woth windows locked.|Positive
The cooler arrived with a small dent in the side which caused the upper tower to shift from it proper position. I had to unscrew the tower and snap it back into place. The water reserve is very difficult to pull out and does not come out completely for cleaning. There are no instructions for making sure no bacteria grows in the water or filter. It produces only a mild coolness, but does add moisture to the a air.|Positive

Worked as it should. Happy with the product.|Positive
Ok, so after reading many reviews online I decided to go to home depot to pick one up for myself on 8-7-2014. Installation wasn't so hard, but you got to make sure you get the right size anchor bolts to mount onto stucco wall. After that, cut plywood board so that it can fit through your window which was not hard at all. I did a install where later on I can take out unit widow damaging my window frame.....just in case if I was ever to sell my house, I can take out without someone knowing it was ever there. Installation may require two people depending on your muscle mass...LOL...but I did manage to do it myself which an extra hand would of been nice. Like one of the comments I've read was when you mount your water line, use a extra set of vise grips to hold the float valve inside tank while you tighten up the bolt to your copper water line. I did not break the plastic that supports the float valve as others since I saw that the plastic was flexing as I try to tighten up the compression fitting. That is one of the down size to this unit. Over tightening screws with drill can strip the plastic which I think can not be repair....so be careful. Ok, enough about the install and safety.....now lets get to HOW THE UNIT WORKS. I live in Fresno CA which can get pretty hot in the summer time. I have notice that on hot humid days over 100 degree this unit wont cool down your house which I know that already with swamp coolers. I have a two story house which is 2200 SQ and does a great job cooling down stairs if its not so humid outside. Also the bleed line for water on the unit can dump as much as a five gallon bucket in two hours.....I don't mind since I use it to water my flower beds. You can plug up the bleed line to save water, but your pads will not last as long. Overall this unit works great when its over 100 degree outside when humidity is low|Positive
We are very happy with this cooler as a whole. I bought it for my mother who lives in a small apartment in New York and she loves it. Note that this unit is intended for small rooms-spaces. I did not purchase it thinking it would cool her apartment down like an AC, but I was hoping it would be better than a regular fan and much less expensive to run and boy, it exceeded our expectations. - Great swamp cooler and great value as well - Easy to move around when she needs to - The water tank is easy to fill - Quiet - It comes with a remote control - Ice packs Included Great product and works perfectly and does exactly what I expected it to. I will definitely recommend this fan to my others relatives and friends.|Positive
For a small unit this cooler works very well. It cools ambient air about 20F. I use about 10-15 gallons per day depending on humidity running 12+- hours per day.|Positive
"I have issues with the instructions: 1. What kind of plastic tray do you need? I used the plastic part of the product card, removing the tags with naptha (lighter fluid), then washing and rinsing. 2. Must clean rust from cooler water pan? 3. Cooler coating must be used prior? I wanted to use this on a new cooler to PREVENT rust and corrosion. 4. Must cover the entire ""tray"" with water. I do not know how deep our new cooler's water depth is, but has to be 2 1/2"" deep. 5. Since this product has not been installed on my or my son's cooler, I don't yet know if it helps anything (both new coolers). 6. Intended for use where coating (paint) is no longer effective? Is DIAL implying that paint or coating is gone and that it will destroy the original paint? If so, it doesn't say that on instructions."|Negative
Works great Thanks|Positive
I use this product to cover my a/c compressor over the winter|Positive
It was easy to install and it doesn't take up much space. We've had it about a month and it cools the rooms very well.|Positive
Works great..I'm very satisfied with the product|Positive
This has to be my new favorite find. This was so easy to get going and made my room comfortable and cool in such a short time. I run hot and always need a fan and this was the perfect way to keep me cool without being freezing. The design is so sleek and classy looking and compact enough that it does not take up much space. It also has a great white noise aspect to it when I am sleeping since I always sleep with a fan on at night, this was perfect for that and not noisy or overwhelming at all. It is easy to maintain the water tank and the different speeds make it so there is something for everyone. I really love the portability of it, it is so lightweight that I can move it around from room to room without trouble.|Positive
I have buying this size cooler for several locations because they don't stick out from the house very far. So it is because of the shape.Easy to set up, and mostly already assembled.This unit was dented and scratched when we uncovered it. I would guess that it had been hit by a fork lift.Once you get something like this to the site and unbox it, you don't want to go through the trouble of taking it back. Any dents and scratches though, tend to shorten the life of the unit because they rust quicker.|Positive
The material was much heavier than I expected. It was also canvas, rather than the cheaper plastic that I had purchased for my prior air conditioner. It was a breeze to install and fit my air conditioner perfectly!|Positive
The unit works great but I dont think it cools the area it clames to. I use it in my shop that is only 900 square foot. It is cool as long as you are right in front of it but it does not cool the area very well. The unit does leak water from the side when the pump is on. I just put some tape to keep the plastic pieces pushed together and it stopped. I don't want to send it back because it takes so long to get another one.|Negative
Unit has a problem getting water pumped on the sides of the unit.|Negative
I got his about a month ago in preparation for fall. I like the lightweight material and easy slip down fit that this cover provides. The drawstring was ample in size and left enough length for me to tie and knot adequately for winter. This does not require a lot of room for storage another plus. However it could have used a storage bag, very easy to use.|Positive
It was perfect|Positive
We have used window coolers for years and chose to purchase this unit for more specific room cooling. Simple to set up, instructions are clear, and the unit truly is easy to move from room to room. Cools quickly, the swing feature is perfect for keeping the air flow off any one person or object, and the night mode is definitely a plus. Loved it so much in the first week, we bought another for our daughters at college. Definitely worth it.|Positive
I have just put this in my bedroom and it is working very well to help keep me cool.|Positive
Used on home made rig|Positive
The cover is almost necessary in the Arizona desert due to the dust that is almost always in the air. It was a very good investment!|Positive
Your swamp cooler ain't going to work workout this part.|Positive
Good unit & it does put out the humidity|Positive
I live in San Diego and purchased this unit for my upstairs office about 4 months ago. since my window is a slider door, i am limited to a portable AC unit which is more costly. After months of trying this out I can say this doesn't cool the air at all. It's simply a fan. If you need to cool down a room this is the wrong way of doing it. I will be purchasing a portable AC unit next.|Negative
Fantastic addition to our patio environment. Encourage to purchase either a second one, or the next step up...|Positive
Very pleased. Wasn’t aware that it had a function for fins to blow side to side as well. Very nice surprise!|Positive
The unit blows fine but I have been experiencing issues with the plug. I plug it in and have to press the reset button and I find that it does not get power so I press again until maybe after 4 trys it finally sets. Not reliable due to this and my fear is it will just stop working.|Negative
I am very pleased with my new cooler, very quiet and very efficient|Positive
I live in Phoenix, Az and I was looking for something that would allow me to be outside in my backyard in the summer when temps are regularly above 100 degrees F. I received the unit in late June when the relative humidity was about 10% and it blew very cold air. Now in late July when the humidity is about 40%, it's not nearly as cold but still puts out a cool enough breeze to be able to sit outside under the shade without being too uncomfortable. A couple of years ago, I had purchased a stand alone portable evap cooler that looked more decorative and less commercial than this one and was only $150. It was worthless. The air coming out of it was barely cooler than the ambient air. This product provides a much more noticeable difference in cooling the air which is why I'm very happy with it so far. On the downside, it is a water hog and probably goes through a gallon every 10 to 15 minutes. Also the buttons seem like they could pop out of the case if the soft plastic warps a little. One of the button rings on mine is already exposing a side tab and popping up a bit. So far I've resisted the temptation to attach a hose to it because I know how bad hard water is for a swamp cooler. I've been filling it with water out of my reverse osmosis kitchen filter which removes almost all the calcium in water. I've found surprisingly little in my online research that will help to prevent calcium buildup other than something which treats the water with a chemical that makes the calcium stay suspended in the water better which doesn't sound too promising to me. It rained the other night and I was able to collect some of the rain water which I've been using as well.|Positive
the cooler was fully assembled, all i had to do was put the wheels on the bottom of the unit. did find a little debris in the tank from the cooling fins, but was easy to clean out. after filling tank with water & turning on found that the unit cooled good. easy to use & fan blows hard.|Positive
Nice variable speed fan, Main issue is the tank has to be 3/4 full to work, which makes it very heavy to move around. Also two sides of the tank a bowed out from the weight of the water. It would be best to have a switch to allow between filling the tank or leaving the tank empty when hooked to it's own water supply.|Positive
Easy to put together and runs smooth But the air flow is under powered.|Negative
So far so good. Only had them on for a couple of weeks.|Positive
It arrived promptly and fit petfectly and works like charm|Positive
Installation instructions are a bit criptic but if you have some common sense and know-how it will come together. Net message: it keeps our 1200 square foot home cool at a fraction of the price of the price of standard air conditioners. That was the goal and this unit made it happen even in 100 degree temperatures.|Positive
The cover is great. It fits very well. Got the straps too. Looks great.|Positive
Great unit. Very quiet especially on low speed. Easy install as unit includes chains, hooks, float valve, etc. I would recommend the addition of a purge pump to keep the water cleaner - this was a simple operation using existing pump plug; nor wiring required. I appreciate that the float valve is on the outside of the unit, not the house side, as this is a common leak point and keeps water away from the foundation of the house.|Positive
This pump fits perfectly into my 3 year old window evaporative cooler and cools my 2600 square foot house to a comfortable 74 degrees, even on the hottest days.|Positive
What a terrific discovery. High quality and moves the air quietly from light breeze to heavier. Industrial wheels make moving unit around effortless. Can enjoy summers outside again. Wish I knew about this years ago.|Positive
It works but I would not tell anyone to go out and purchase it..|Negative
Very easy to install, lightweight and very ply-able. I noticed a dramatic difference right after I put it on. Works great, thanks for a product that works.|Positive
Tried in a small room, no real difference noted. Ice, ice packs, or cold water didn't help. Returning it today|Negative
Had to replace our old cover, so glad we found this one. It fits so much better than the old one. Love the velcro closure too.|Positive
We have huge coolers at work and I needed more volume. This pump gives me the volume I need to keep the pads wet. We have been very happy with this pump. And have purchased multiple units.|Positive
This air cooler is a great product for a small room. I live in a small apartment with no air conditioning. This air cooler worked ok for my living space when temps. reached 95 degrees in Hillsboro. But I have a combined kitchen/dining room/living room combination, so the area is the major portion of the apartment. I actually think I should have invested in a larger sq. ft. unit and have been more comfortable. I still would recommend this product for a small bedroom.|Positive
Very easy to install. The design is beautiful and functional. We love it very much!!!|Positive
Description stated it is a little larger to compensate for shrinkage, but it was considerably larger. It is very baggy on the unit and had to use multiple straps to keep it from flapping in the wind.|Negative
This is definitely an awesome cooler to have and have recommended it to friend to purchase. The only issue I have is that when there's between a quarter and half a tank left of water, you can already hear the pump struggling to get water through the cooler. Other than that, it cools quickly and it doesn't add too much humidity to the house.|Positive
An incredible failure. Purchased two and within a few days, both began collapsing under their own weight. Upon start up, each sounded like it was coming apart. Also much smaller than expected. Returned for a full refund.|Negative
Synthetic pads are not the same! These pads will cool better and last longer. I tried the other type and threw them away - ordered these to replace them.|Positive
My office space is like an oven even in early spring. When I saw this product I was intrigued. After setting it up in my work space a co-worker came by and told me it was at least 10-15 degrees cooler.Sweet Relief! It is easy to fill, easy to operate and seems to have fit my needs perfectly. It is designed for smaller spaces not to cool an entire house. I love this cooler!|Positive
Unit look cheap with too much plastic. Never worked. Called costumer service without any answer. Maybe they are on vacation. Returned for a full refund (thanks HD).|Negative
As i said in a previous review, I was very disappointed. So today, I removed the mesh screen that's mounted along the cooling absorbent pad then I cut the pad in half with a long serrated kitchen knife as to have two pads. I rotated the pad as i cut through to keep an even cut. Now, leaving the screen out and using half of the pad, the Artic Cove is now 90% efficient than the OEM.(Original Equipment Manufacturer)AND.. I have a spare pad.|Negative
Cost is high, but needed it - so had no choose but the purchase|Negative
Great window cooler. This is my second unit and planning on buying a third. I use them to cool off my animals and even on low they keep them cool even in 105 degree weather. The first one that I purchased I use to cool my rabbitry. Keeps them very cool even on low. That one is going on 5 years and still going strong. The second one I purchased is going on 12 months also without any problems and I use it for my dog nursery. Its very economical compared to using an air conditioner so even though this unit is more expensive it pays for itself over time in electricity savings. Highly recommend|Positive
Best cooler I ever bought. No problems at all. My home is 1132 sqft. when it's 90+ outside it's about 68-70 inside. It gets kinda chilly. The fan low setting was like my A/C high setting. Pretty Awesome! It even cools the garage to 70 and it faces the west and get afternoon sun and gets up to 110 inside.|Positive
First of all...let’s be real...this will not cool your whole room, so if you thought a $40 air cooler was gong to do that, then move along! However, our central air is on its last legs and about 5 nights out of every week, it is frozen up and not working again. Well, we cannot afford to replace our AC right now and we live in Florida so the temperature in our upstairs was about 85 degrees and it was impossible to sleep. I bought two of the Arctic Air units and placed them on our bedside tables on each side of the bed. These little gems keep me so cool while sleeping that I actually have to pull the blanket up. I am actually here to buy two more because my son and daughter in law are staying with us this summer! TIP: fill tank with water and then wait about 30 minutes and fill again...the filter absorbs water and filling the tank a 2nd time will make it last all night. ALSO, don’t underestimate the position of the vents...they move only slightly, but if you adjust it to blow directly on you once you are situated, you will not be disappointed! BONUS: if you live in a hurricane area like we do, it’s great that the unit will run off of a battery source (like a larger battery you would use to charge your cell phone if you didn’t have electricity)|Positive
I liked this evaporation cooler but it was very cheaply made and only lasted 2 summers. Using only part time while working in my garage. HD does not carry this product any longer and I can see why.|Negative
The cooler works well but only cools down about 400 sq ft. in a 1000 sq ft garage. Openings by garage doors and a screen door on other side of the garage for ventilation as recommended. Also beware that it uses 4 gallons a hour so if you do not have access to a hose hook up then you will constantly be filling the unit with buckets of water and that is a lot of time involved. Have had it for 1 month and temperature has been in the 90's with no humidity. It will drop the temperature about 12 degrees but only in a small area not 1600 ft area.|Negative
Unit is massive, extremely loud and basically functioned as a large van. The air was not cool. Additionally, the unit needs to be near a water supply, or connected to a hose; otherwise you need to refill it every few hours that it is running.|Negative
As a former HVAC contractor I installed literal hundreds of swamp coolers. This is by far the simplest design and very functional. Many reviews complained about the fan or pump failing after a year or 2. The good news is that the parts can easily be replaced by many off-the shelf pumps and motors. Some reviews complained about quality so I would guess they have not worked with many swamp coolers as this is really well built. The unit functions well. The fan is vary well designed and has minimal fan noise. Air flow is noisy because 4,500 CFM is a lot of air. We have about 30% humidity which is the maximum I would recommend using a swamp cooler. Even with that humidity it cooled our 1300 sq ft home 25 degrees lower that outside temp. Easy to work on, efficient and looks good too.We live off-grid so the low energy use is great.|Positive
Purchased for my 4 car garage and it works great. Finding the wheels took a bit of time. They are concealed in a compartment at the bottom of the unit. You have to tip the unit on it's side in order to access the 4 screws that hold the door on the compartment. The instructions only indicate that the wheels are concealed in the bottom of the unit which is a little ambigious.as to how to access that compartment. My water pressure is higher than the 30 PSI maximum for the auto fill feature so I had to purchase a 25 PSI restrictor. $7 at Home Depot. Other than that it was plug in and go.|Positive
The pads work well absorbing the water. The shipping box was flimsy and the pad was cracked in the middle. It still installed fine and works ok. The crack may lessen the pad life though...we'll see down the road.|Negative
The swing feature quit after 2 days and the cooling feature quit after 1 week. Even when the cooling feature worked it only cooled the 250 square foot room by about 2 to 3 degrees. Not worth the money. Disappointed.|Negative
Excellent quality.|Positive
This product has really helped keep our apartment cooler.|Positive
I installed this in my window. Very easy to install. Literally just 10 screws (8 inside and 2 outisde) and the water line. I installed it by myself in less than an hour. Does not come with those plastic shroud things that come with window ac units which i would have preferred that it had come with. I ended up using foam weather stripping. I just installed it about a week ago and so far it works great. Better than my central ac. I have a 1650 sqft home and about 70% is vaulted ceiling. The first day I put it in it was 87 degrees in my house. In about an hour it had cooled my house 9 degrees while on high but it was probably around 7 or 8pm. My central ac only cools my house to about 85 degrees when its 100 outside. This thing cools my house to about 80 degrees keeping it on medium and sometimes switching to low. The only two complaints I have about it are the louvers. You can only direct air flow left or right. the left half of the louvers can point straight or to the left. the right half straight or to the right. wish it had up and down adjustment. the best location for me to put it was in this particular window in my living room (next to my couch that i sit to watch tv) where it would face down the hall into the bedrooms. this is the reason my i do not like that it has no up down louver adjustment because when its on and i'm watching tv it gets chilly, specially on medium or high. also kind of loud and have to turn up tv volume. so basically, if i want to watch tv i have to get a blanket or close half the louvers which i hate doing because then i don't get all the air flow to cool my house. I also don't like that you have to flip a switch to use remote or vice versa when you want to use knob on unit. When off, you can feel the breeze coming in from the outside if you have the vents open so keep this in mind for the winter time. I will be taking it out after summer since its so easy to remove and then reinstall again next summer. I believe they also sell covers for outside and inside but are probably pricey. I have also looked into replacing the pads and they cost $120 plus shipping and it said backordered on website which is the only place you can get them so plan ahead. Seems like it will last for a while. Its plastic so no rust. Although mine will only be outside four months out of the year. Looks better than those ugly metal boxes although the maintenance is cheaper on those and you can find parts at your local store. I knew this and still got it. One more thing. Follow instructions and remove outside cover after 10 hours. I did, and there was quite a bit of loose material from pads at the bottom of the water tank. I also did it after another 10 hours after the first cleaning and still had loose materials. I will be checking it again in a couple days.Really easy to clean. Takes about 10 minutes. Overall the only thing that I really don't like about it is the louver thing. Bonaire, what is so hard about making it with up and down adjustment?|Positive
Works well in my 2 car garage to help keep it cool in the summer heat.|Positive
Pros: This cooler feels better than plain air on a hot day, as long as the ice pack is changed out every two hours or so. It is not self-maintaining. The blower is nice and strong, so you can use it without the extra cooling. It has a swing option that distributes the air nicely. Never had a problem with water leaking from it, which was a concern initially. Cons: My unit broke after about a year and the actual period of regular use was 5-7 months. That was disappointing, however, the manufacturer was easy to communicate with via email and so that was appreciated. They recommended a replacement part which I've purchased and hope will repair the unit.|Positive
We use this on outback porch in Vegas. Works great in 114F heat. Fan has great range. We must be close to feel the cool air if it’s over 100F, but under 100F it works like a champ. Cools the whole patio are nicely.I would recommend it. Works best in low humidity.|Positive
Old unit like this one was awesome! Sure this one will be as well!|Positive
Great Price for the money & plenty of length|Positive
We love our Evaporative Cooler. It fits in the window, not on the roof. You can take it out and put it in the garage during the winter because it's so light weight. The best of all we only have to put it on low when we use it.|Positive
It fits my cooler.|Positive
I wouldn't recommend this product. The unit leaks water like crazy, and doesn't do a good job anyhow...|Negative
Been running this unit a couple of weeks now, and it seems to work well and certainly does the job.|Positive
The filters fit correctly and have worked great in our cooler.|Positive
My husband and I have tried everything to cool down our apartment in the summer and nothing's been working until now--this evaporative cooler has changed my life and I'm not kidding. Phoenix heat is no joke, and when it gets unbearably dry even sitting inside becomes unbearable. This evaporative cooler has finally made our home feel comfortable even on the hottest day of the year.|Positive
When I can get this air-conditioner functioning it works fine. HOWEVER, I just had to order and pay for the third thermostat for this model! The first one mysteriously went out, blank, no LCD whatsoever...when we went to turn it up again this season, (mind you the unit was purchased in April 2016), the thermostat is not working once again. I am only a few days out of warranty but I still have to pay for it, it's become principal at this point. I would say if there's another comparable model you may want to skip this one, I should not have to go through three thermostats in one year. Really disappointed with this product. Also disappointed that MasterCool did not pick up the tab on this thermostat, swore there was no known problems.|Negative
Good cheap pump for areas with hard water. Ours has to be replaced on a yearly basis from calcium deposits. Next year going to buy pads and pump at the same time so there will only be one trip to the roof.|Positive
Does ok in my motorhome as long as you have it blowing on you... I would like to see one you could sit outside with a large flexible vent pipe that you could run in your window...|Negative
Was very ineffective. Supposed to cool 100sqft but didn't even cool 4ft from me with the ice packs in the water.|Negative
It seems to me like these pads are just as good as the original name brand pads and for less money. Easy to install. The original set of pads lasted over 5 years. Hopefully these ones will do the same.|Positive
eliminated the squeaking and engine overheating. Thanks!|Positive
I don't know if I just got a bad one but it literally lasted 2 weeks and burned out. Come on people! Lets get our act together and start putting some great American product back on our shelves instead of throw away crap from overseas. We run our cooler about 12 hours a day in the summer time and if this pump cant handle that then i guess it belongs on a fish tank instead. I definately will NOT buy another one of these. Switching to another brand to see what happens. I really hate buying junk and to me this is junk. As a consumer there's nothing more irritating than wasting my hard earned money, fuel, and time having to take back a piece of you know what!!|Negative
very good cooler use it on our back porch|Positive
This cooler come fully assembled. The CFM and price were right. Really loving the cool moist air now, should have replaced the old unit last year after experiencing this new unit.|Positive
The product easily and efficiently secures the canvas cover. Installed: 10/6/2018|Positive
does ok job|Negative
Thicker the the ones in the store|Positive
"I not only recommend this product (cooler pads)... but completely recommend this cooler too!. This cooler works great! So easy to service. Even a 50+ year-old women (myself) can service it! I initially called a cooling and heat professional. After waiting 2-weeks and taking the day off from work, he came out and quoted me $410.00 to replace the pads and clean the fan. He said he would have to special order the pads. I told him that Home Depot sells the coolers, suggested the pads could be found there, and I was happy to order and pick them up and will it be cheaper. He told me... ""No, no difference in price because to replace the pads... it takes a special tool, they're difficult... its the same price."" Nothing could be further from the truth! I called Home Depot. So genius that every Bonaire coolers uses the same cooler pad(s). I ordered via Home Depot app, picked up a few days latter, and looked up ""How to change Bonaire Cooler Pads"" on Youtube. (Home Dept or Bonaire should make and post one). I watched it, and did this myself. It was so easy!!! I unplugged the unit, used needle nose payers to remove the disks, and pushed the clips out (that are placed from the from the exterior) and I heaved the calcified pad in the garbage can. I cleaned vent and fan with vinegar and water, and placed the new pads and clips (added a few of the old clips too). Way easier then making a cake!"|Positive
This fan was engineered by an imbecile. How do you fail at making the water pump through the coolingg portion of the fan? Defeats the purpose doesnt it? Dont buy!!|Negative
I bought this kit along with a Champion 3000 side draft cooler (with rounded corners) from Home Depot last week. Since this is the only round corner leg kit stocked, I assumed compatibility, boy was I wrong! The legs are too wide requiring either modification to the cooler or the legs. While much more complex, I choose to modify the legs because the last thing I want to do is grind away a portion of the cooler's main pan exposing the bare metal to the elements - rust, after all, is what killed my last swamp cooler. I did this with a reciprocating saw, pliers and a helper. What should have taken 5 to 10 minutes ended up taking over an hour. But that's not it. Yes, it gets even better. The manufacturer designed the legs in such a way that if the nut and bolt holding the leg to the foot were to ever come loose, the weight of the cooler would force the leg to bypass the foot and penetrate your roof. PLEASE NOTE that this obvious design flaw can be remedied by NOT following the manufacturer's instructions and installing the feet with the leg on the inside of the foot bracket. This applies to both the right angle kit as well as the rounded corner kit.|Negative
The cooler works fine, but it's not for my needs. I wanted to use it inside, but it is extremely loud. It also needs water everyday, which is a pain if you can't hook it up to a water supply. When the water level gets to half, the pump starts making a loud clicking noise. Probably better for outside|Negative
300 sq foot bed room now cool enough in summer to sleep at night, room is on west side of house and is cooled from the central Air Conditioner but is still too hot to sleep at night, unit lowers temp enough to sleep with out freezing out rest of house.|Positive
Excellent help from Home Depot choosing the correct pump for my evaporative cooler. Easy to install. Working well; I hope for many years.|Positive
Worked as expected! Great tool.|Positive
We received unit just next to last day of our hot spell. Cooled well. Used it again 3 weeks later and still ran good. Osscilator works good. Cooled room down about10 to 12 degrees. Ice helped cool down even more.|Positive
I had this same brand for 3 years before it broke. I purchased a new one and returned it because the red arrow water level indicator wasn't connected and was in the bottom of the tank. We couldn't get to the indicator to attach the red arrow. We returned it and bought a different brand.|Negative
Good material..|Positive
Works good after having to take apart and fix loose parts after calling factory|Negative
had 2 of them the first one right out of the package in the parking lot bearing was locked right up took both back made in china|Negative
"Pump died after 1 or 2 years. No thermostat control either--it's either ""on or off"" instead of ""keep things at 72"" It did work for installing it ""side ways"" which was nice, and seems to be holding up well."|Negative
Love it. works well. easy to add water. automatic timer.|Positive
"The split-level house we're renting in NE WA has no air conditioning, and most of the time, it doesn't need to: there's only about a 6-week period during the year where the outdoor temperatures routinely exceed 85 degrees F. But when the outdoor temperature cracks 90 degrees F, the interior becomes uncomfortable by mid-afternoon, so I started looking around for something to help beat the heat. This is where the Honeywell evaporative coolers come in. I bought two, and positioned one in the living room (next to the sliding glass door leading out to the porch) and the other in the hall, facing into my kids' rooms. They do the trick: while they don't keep the air as cool as an air conditioner does, they keep the upstairs temp within tolerable limits. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase: we weathered the hot weeks this year much more comfortably than we did last year. Pros: the tank capacity is large and lasts for hours and the ""swing"" feature is nice. Although there are 3 speeds, I've yet to use it on the highest speed... haven't really needed to. Even on the ""medium"" speed, the fan is powerful enough to reach across the rooms it's in/aimed at. Cons: the units are somewhat bulky and not particularly attractive. In addition, they add to the background noise. For the record, these aren't issues for me: I'm not a ""home beautiful"" type, and I used to work in a bio lab with a similar noise level from the fume/laminar-flow hoods. Some people might care about these things, however, so I figured I should mention them. Also too: the ice feature is pretty useless - it requires replenishing every 15 minutes or so, and I have better things to do than babysit the coolers. But this is a minor issue, IMHO - as noted above, I'm satisfied with the coolers... they do what I need them to do."|Positive
Perfect fit for you swap cooler recommend if needing a solid swap cooler cover|Positive
The cooler was great, the problem nobody knew where the cooler was. It took over a hour to pick it up.|Positive
Good to use straight out of the box. Acts as both a cooler and humidifier. Yay me.|Positive
After purchasing all the connector hoses and adapters for this pump, I went to plug it into the outlet and low and behold there was a completely foreign looking plug. I never thought to look at that before getting everything else done and I have never seen a plug like that. I returned the pump and made mention of the defect and I don't believe it was put back into your inventory.|Negative
Long time user of MasterCool products and have always had good luck with their performance and durability. The unit I bought was a little higher in price than some local dealers; but, the local dealers didn't have the model I needed in stock for immediate delivery as the Home Depot did have available. I'm looking forward to a hot summer ahead and staying cool with my new unit.|Positive
Using this for the green house and is working as anticipated|Positive

Works great. A perfect solution for a small space.|Positive
Installed easil- have not used yet as it is still winter but should be good to go|Positive
This cooler is working good. But It doesn't lower the temperature of the room. It isn't efficient at cooling and you can only feel the air if sitting right beside it. Good for one person.|Negative
Works very well and I'd buy it again. Made the house cold that same night.|Positive
Great in price and awesome that it was easy to find in the store to save on shipping. Went in quick, and worked like charm.|Positive
Block bearing was in stock, along with replacement pulley. Replacement involved removing old bearing and pulley, requiring angle grinder with cutting blade to remove prior to replacement with replacement parts. Cooler running smoothly.|Positive
In reading the reviews, I knew that this cooler is designed for dryer climates. Living in Atlanta, the humidity is high and this cooler worked about as well as I expected. The fan works well and the cooler does lower the temp some so I am glad I bought it. It is not an air conditioner, so don't expect it to drastically cool. It is just enough to be able to enjoy outdoor spaces in high humidity and temps in the summer.|Negative
easy to install. Easy to adjust. simple and good. The worst thing was removing the old, rusted one and damaging the mount for it. Had to manufacture a new mount for this one.|Positive
good for me|Positive
Works great, especially in low humidity and with a window open to circulate dry air. Yeah, it is kind of loud because it is POWERFUL. Need a watering container with narrow spout to get water in there accurately, or you can hook up a hose. Made of plastic and has wheels so not super heavy. goes through water pretty quick. Yes it is pretty large and bulky. Fan is very powerful and this cooled my 900 sq ft open living room and kitchen nicely, and even cools upstairs loft a little (room has tall cathedral style vaulted ceilings. Good for the price.|Positive
These are awful, less than half the thickness of the original pad -- debating whether to put a second layer in or put the old pads back in|Negative
The cooler motor cord fit my AC and installed in minutes. A good buy!|Positive
easy to install, is working really good beside not being the brand in had b4|Positive
